        "I'm sure there are sites dedicated to the time travel inconsistencies in this movie so I won't go into them. There were a lot. That end fight was just way too much, I was checking the time and ready for it to wrap up by then. My favorite heroes were under utilized.\n\nIt was a good ending to the infinity series. I'm not sure what I was expecting. I was just ready for it to be over by then.",
        "Where \"Infinity War\" created havoc, \"Avengers: Endgame\" promised closure. The film is jam-packed with re-enactments of previous films' relationships. It practically requires that viewers do their homework by watching (or rewatching) a dozen previous films. The emphasis switches from lavish, effects-driven demonstrations of universe-saving heroism to the more personal cost of heroism. It establishes that whoever possesses the six all-powerful Infinity Stones may accomplish almost anything by just snapping their fingers. Because there is so much territory to cover in the film, it skips over introductions and presents Captain Marvel's entrance as a foregone conclusion.",
        "What I like: it's a good ending. It's connected with the previous plot. It's about the past and the future, reality and memory, emotion and choice. What I don't like: there are too many boring slogans; there is too much discord in the existence of the surprise captain, and there is no such shock in the trailer.",
        "One of the best superhero movies I have ever watched.\n\nAll the actors really nailed their roles.\n\nEspecially my one and only favorite iron man.\n\nRobert Downey Jr is irreplaceable in Iron man role.",
        "Mild spoilers ahead: This movie could lose some 60 minutes and nobody would notice (or probably will - it would be more fun). Some great acting wasted. Exponential comic absurdity mixed with cheap philosophy. SFX could be much better for such an epic attempt. Weepy ending with forced pathos ruins everything. I was truly glad when it finally was over. 3 stars for wrapping this up, hopefully for good.",
        "Infinity was one of the best films ever! This is a disgrace of a follow-up. Slow, elongated and boring. I sat through 1.5 hours and gave up, waiting for something to happen. My advice, do not bother!",
        "After watching Infinity war, I was looking forward to much more this time, still a perfect ending.",
        "Captain America switched with lokki at some point in past and captain never returned. This was more like a soap than action movie.",
        "I have watched the first part many, many times. Every minute of it was accounted for with importance to the plot - not wasted on snowflake emotions.\n\nThis second half has an excellent plot, but oh, my - how it dragged on with talk and tears!\n\nI also didn't like Pepper suddenly being outfitted as a fighter?! lol! And, considering the future hero roles revealed in this one, can we eventually expect a white Black Panther, too?! Don't get me wrong - I don't want to see a white Black Panther.\n\nSeveral other points of disappointment, too.\n\nBummer.",
        "This entire movie was based on time travel, it's in the same category as Hot tub time machine. It's so awful its embarrassing.",
        "One just gets the sense that this movie took a subtle yet noticeable shift away from what captured many people's hearts in the earlier MCU movies.\n\nThe actors give off the feeling of being forced to portray a role that used to be natural fits in order to impose various woke messages. There are so many but they come at a rate of every couple of minutes, ranging from blatant grrl power, to emasculation and so on. Muddling along.\n\nAside from the odd action scenes, this movie could pass as a drama.",
        "They've really scrapped the bottom with this one! Oh so Bad!",
        "This movie was the biggest let down and anti climax of all time, I am one of the true marvel fans having grown up with the comics and watching all the big and small screen adaptations however this movie had the hype and potential to be the biggest greatest movie of all time , it wasn't it was rubbish !! And a joke , I felt so strongly about this i created this account just to write a review on this horrible movie . I won't spoil it but it was a rip off and a cheat infinity war was amazing 10/10 but endgame is 1/10 also just to rub salt into the wound there is no end credit cut scene so don't waste your time.... you are welcome,\n\nI can't believe the money this movie will make and it isn't even any good",
        "Beginning was great, ending was great, I barely stayed awake in the middle.",
        "I'm an Avengers fan but to me, Endgame was the worst part. Infinity war was much better. Even the action scenes are incomparable. Only 4 stars!",
        "This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.",
        "This movie was bad for anyone who is not a paid Disney reviewer, a teenager or an adult who hasn't grown out of their teenage fanboy stage. There are too many scenes of unfunny one-liners right in the middle of people dying that it is a slough to sit through. The powers that people can do either changes or are forgotten between scenes. Even the action is so spread out with most of the movie being geeky time-travel talk. When the action does appear, it is edited so hard it makes it difficult to know (or care) what happens.\n\nIf you just looking for a popcorn non-thinking, background while I do dishes movie, maybe this works. Any adult with an adult brain that likes movies to make sense of have some semblance of logic....pass.",
        "Disappointing, Emotional BS, Family BS, Random Moments that try to be funny, Overpowered Women, Underpowered Thor, Boring 1st Hour & many more....\n\nThis movie was a disgrace to the entire franchise. Watching the avengers & other marvel movies that all lead up to this.... Hell No!\n\nTo all reading this review Do Not watch Marvel movies like I did; all those expectations lead to this... :-{ Investing all those hours & emotional energy & it all went down the drain.\n\nI give the movie a 4 for the action scenes & the VFX, the rest was just Underwhelming.",
        "The Russo Brothers will be forever known as the directors that failed a franchise and insulted the very fans that embraced it.\n\nI have no idea why they felt their finished product would pay homage to Stan Lee's legacy or the characters he brought to life but this \"closure\" to a decade of greatness was, in fact, the most disappointing 3-hours of character assassination in cinematic history.",
        "A garbage with full of unpleasant characters and boring story and i call that a real charlatanism to stole your money and giving you a 3 hours long headache with minimum suspense and bad cgi and nothing more. i hope we never saw that characters anymore and never have such garbage anymore.",
        "I am a huge Marvel fan and have loved the previous Avengers films so went with high Hope's for this, unfortunately I was disappointed beyond belief. Long, slow, dull scences make up most of the movie with only about 10 minutes of actual action. Main characters are sidetracked for less popular ones and the whole film moves at a snail's pace. It really felt like they had run out of ideas and this is just a money making film. So, so let down and would not recommend.. recommend it to anyone",
        "Let's see ... we can't write a decent story or come up with anything original any more. So let's just throw every character ever conceived of into a giant mashup & that'll make a great movie! Right? WRONG!!",
        "What was that. A fat useless thor. Bits of old stuff. An ant. A stupid looking not the hulk.. I give up. That was awful.. All hype. 3 hours of my life I can't get back... You wait it will dawn on you... This was just a bad film.",
        "Hope 'endgame' means no more sequels. Story is so thin, the dialogues so silly and the melodrama painful that even the fine actors are not given a chance to show their abilities. What a marvellous waste ot time.",
        "I had no choice but to watch it to finish the sequence. The worst of all the Avengers movies. Apart from some action scenes all the rest it is pure lame dialogues and poor performances. Purely made to make money out of a \"trendy\" public that are rating this movie high because I've never met one single person who has read the comics and like this garbage. At least, there will be no more of this, I hope.",
        "Should have stopped at the previous movie. Long live Thanos.",
        "Captain America, Iron man and the Avengers all should have stopped after their first movie. Antman was terrible whatsoever and only Thor Ragnarok was a better movie than the first in the serie. Endgame is a horrible movie and only rated high since it is the end of a well appreciated line.",
        "Garbage that fits with today's over blown pc generation of over thinking and numbing lifeless endings. Not a fan of these films and this was the worst considering the waste of talent and plot that just seemed to be about over the top nonsense. The sad thing is how many people fall into the trap of thinking this movie has any validity of reality!!",
        "My 10 year old nephew LOVES super heroes and he's watched all Marvel and DC movies, but after 30+ minutes into this one he says: \"This movie is no good. We are wasting our time\".\n\nI couldn't agree more. We forced ourselves to continue watching though, maybe it would get better. It didn't. At times we both laughed at how bad it was.\n\nThe 10 year old who (again) LOVES super hero movies suddenly stopped watching while there was still 40 minutes left, he just went out to play instead. At this point I couldn't care less of how things turned out at the end so I just turned it off prematurely.\n\nJust an indication of how failed this movie was, in our opinion.",
        "They could have cut an hour and a half of the slow unimportant scenes.",
        "The alternate title for this film: \"How to Cram a 90 Minute Movie Into 3 Hours.\"",
        "Three hours wasted, was about as good as declawing my dog and at least I like the dog. The storyline was terrible, and for many blatantly obvious reasons made no senses, to make matters worse it seemed to have more holes in it, than my old gym socks. Yes I know all the good guys weren't going to make it, everyone knew that, I actually hoped a few wouldn't make it, and that's not what I care about, this movie was rubbish it labored three hours to get to the point of dead good guys/bad guys then victory and bang happy ever after for two minutes then over. This is going straight in the never watch again list, unless trapped on a plane in which case fingers crossed for a parachute, but will jump without one.",
        "How did I not recognize Karen Gillan as nebula !! Funny at times otherwise kinda ridiculous",
        "I don't really know what all the hype is about. Bored watching this as it's the same again just rehashed. Glad to see the back of the Avengers to be honest.",
        "This one was boring. They could have taken out an hour of random stuff that was just drama material and boring. Also the best characters only came in the end (Groot, chris pratt and the other dudes from guardians of the galaxy) which is the only interesting part of the movie",
        "Wow! What a POS movie...So much talking. So much crying.. So much boring no action garbage. These high scores must be paid off. Don't believe the reviews. Stopped watching in one hour..and yes that first hour was painful. I can't imagine fighting thru another two hours. What a shocker. A three hour movie that stinks. Who's idea is it to make movies three hours?!?! Most of them are garbage.\n\nSkip this at all costs",
        "This movie was more boring than all the other avengers. Its way too long. There's no action until the 3rd hour. It really makes a complete mess . All these forced seens felt flat. Why ? to push current agendas.",
        "99% talking & a rushed battle at the end.\n\nThey used 99% old movie footage to market this movie & everyone fell for it, me included.\n\nThe only reason it made so much money was because people expected them to elevate above Infinity War, which was a great 1st part.",
        "What a horrible way to end. A waste of 11 years. So sad.",
        "First 30 minutes everyone is moping around couldn't hang around for another 2 & a half hours to see overpaid morons do senseless acts. I am ashamed to contribute towards this movie's box office record.\n\nPS: I am not a dumb merican who likes stupid action without a story. Disney has ruined movies no one will make quality movies anymore just idiotic superhero stuff.",
        "Where to begin. 30 mins in I got an uneasy feeling. An hour in something felt very wrong. Two hours in I was in shock. This film is a bloated, BORING, convoluted slog of time travel utter nonsense. The positive reviews of this film have me convinced that professional reviewers, pod-casters and tv/youtube talking heads are being paid for favorable reviews. I'd hate to sound like a conspiracy minded person but... During the 3 hours in a sold-out theatre I barley heard a chuckle as most of the jokes fell flat, rare for a marvel movie. The end garnered no applause, also rare for an event movie like this. So many characters are minimized or just poorly written. For the record I loved Infinity War. I thought I was walking in to the greatest comic book super hero movie ever and I could not be more disappointed.",
        "Ah, humanity.. if the collective decides that something is good, cool and great, it sees it through tragically twisted perspective. This time, everyone just seems to fall under the brainwashing hype train of this whole Marvel cinematic universe cultural farce. Let's just shut our brains off and ignore the absolutlely OVERWHELMING amount of stupidity and shallow, fake pathetics that these plots and heroes present us with.\n\nNot me! I'll say that the Infinity War was actually good, this was far too much of a brain hurting cringefest.",
        "Thee same movie over and over, that\u00b4s the MCU. The same repetitive jokes and villain, only with a different cape ... The story is boring and tries a lot to be something it is not!!!!",
        "Pains me to write this review, towards one of my beloved franchises\n\nThe movie was BORING!!! When writers meet a block, they write about time machines, and really. that is where the movie flops. Before it even left the page to go on film Lets sum up, -1 hour and 30 minutes of recap from previous movie/boring SUPER slow amp up towards for an ending, just to explain the horrid choice of time travel -20 minutes of action/climax, that was mostly a copy n past from earlier movies -30 minutes of SLOW boring ending\n\nDont even get me started on Ms. Larson's flat acting, or the fact the Marvel Cannon was ignored.. Guess Capt America is now the God of Lightning? Right.... This is a disgrace to the Marvel franchise Save your time, and money. Dont even rent this",
        "Frank Capra had a golden rule - a movie can be many things but the number one sin is boring. Endgame - wanted to like it, spent money to like it, and .... boring. long, talkative and not worth the time. 2 hours would be fine, stretched to 3. Comedy was good mostly but not the padding. Long long intro shots of this and that. It finally hit the gold standard of DC. It took itself way way too seriously. So I am disappointed and sad. About right up there with Star Trek - The Motion Picture for boring. I don't like writing this, but ....... boring.",
        "Standard story with happy end with a lot of tearful and stupid dialogs. A battle till about 10-15 mins from 3 hours.",
        "Now, that a week has spend after his releasing ay theatres, i'll explain muy question in Pesce. After five or six years after this, could there be something about this movie that makes recomended, else of his hype and the marketing?\n\nI Am not a really Marvel or DC's fan, but i loved some of their movies such as; DC's: Dark Knight all, Wonder Woman, Man on Steel, Shazam. And Marvel's: Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr Strange, Winters soldier, and of Course: Infinity War. But i was waiting a lot about this, i has too big expectations, them go to the midnight releasing and i found a fast food product of movie; horrible script, horrible performance, stupid logic, terrible story. Really is this the current cinema's way? I ll'get out of this awful and cheap movie theather.",
        "Not a full review cause I don't feel like doing one.\n\nEndgame was fine. It's riddled with far too many plot holes, cringy humor and weird character choices for me to give it anything over a 5. Hulk and Thor are completely butchered here as characters imo. The 2nd act is boring and does every time travel clich\u00e9 you could think of, third act however, although blatant fan service is fun and exciting to watch. 3rd act basically saves the movie. The main reason I saw this was to see how Captain America's arc ends since he is one of the few characters I care about in the mcu. Unfortunately Iron Man's arc is done way better here compared to Cap's. No spoilers but Captain America's ending is shoehorned in at the last second and makes no sense. It felt completely unnatural . Oh yeah and hulk dabs, in the year 2023.",
        "...and if I lasted more than an hour, I'd probably come up with more adjectives\n\nthis is THE worst superhero movie in a line of really bad films. all the 'old' cast (who reeeaally got older throughout the marvel cineverse) looks like they've just came to get their final paycheck. it just feels forced, like a bad commercial, or like a prog rock song that should've ended few minutes ago. none of what we see makes any sense, there's no sensible plot , even \"fun stuff\" comes off as rather sad. and that's the word that describes the final (?) avengers movie the best way - sad...",
        "This movie was an hour and a half too long! The first half of the movie was slow and uninteresting. It did improve as it went along but was unnecessarily long and carried on with so much non sense that was not essential to the plot. Another example of an over hyped film doing well at the box office because of a big budget and star power. It is marginally better than the last Avengers movie but still mediocrity at its best.",
        "I had higher expectation from this movie but it turned out to be superheroes drama/comedy mixed with little action. There was very little action in the movie compare to past Avengers. 3d effects were not up to mark either. I was fairly disappointed by this one. If drama is your genre then go for it but if you like action then skip it.",
        "The plot was messy, and so vast, with so many amazing characters, who were all simply diluted into one giant mess of a movie. Didn't really find the humour amazing either.",
        "#MCUrewatch. This is the big one. It all led to this: the big finale of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is epic filmmaking at its best. The original Avengers shine. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye: they all get their great moment. It is a fitting conclusion to the character arcs of especially Iron Man and Captain America. But, in revisiting the previous movies, also a fitting reward for the fan of this franchise. More then 10 years and 20 films. One overarching story. It is a mammoth achievement in film history.",
        "Three words to describe the methodology inherent in destroying a franchise - or any story for that matter. For all the intrigue, conjecture, speculation, and cosmic potential Endgame enjoyed long before its release - and might have included - they opted for the least fascinating and pedestrian of stories: when it all else fails, just go back in time and change it! I do not mind heavy CGI movies with no substance; they're entertaining from a technical perspective, and when a decent story props it up, at least there exists some satisfaction. That said, with Infinity War, there was great possibility. I'm not going to bother with a detailed review here ... this movie was wrong ... all those richly detailed characters, all those amazing back stories, all that simmering creativity, all that ingenuity and inspiration totally and utterly wasted. I gave it 4 Stars just because it's nice to end the misery, but it is difficult to appreciation the wastefulness. Sad really.",
        "I am a Marvel fan, and probably the only one who didn't like this movie. Felt like it was slow, non sensical and unlike the previous Avengers movie, I didn't care what happened in the end. Dissapointing for me.",
        "I give it 3 stars for the huge effort, special effects and good acting. Overall it is a stupid film, bloated with self-importance and sentimentality, with poor pacing. Action scenes did not quite land with me, you know, superheroes throwing and punching stuff, who cares.",
        "What's this dribble, there's about 30 minutes of action and it's a predictable boring at that and overall mind numbing silly movie , all but this one are okay , what agenda are the feminists pushing as they try going woke and ending up broke. Shame ,hope you downloaded it and were not shammed out of any money to watch...",
        "The worst superhero movie ever and with GoT is one of the most Overrated Things ever. Awful and ugly movie",
        "After all these years THAT is what we get? A movie that makes no sense whatsoever, Because every time i try to figure something out about the movie another plothole appears.. X-Men3 The Last Stand is a masterpiece compared to Endgame and thats saying something! 3 stars only for Tom Holland, love him as Spiderman",
        "If you've been loving the MCU films recently, then this will probably be your favorite one yet. It's absolutely jammed packed with material, and the more MCU films you've seen, the better it'll be.\n\nHowever, the movie is dragged down by an extensive runtime, and jokes that miss the mark. Endgame takes too long to get going, and then seemingly never ends. And most of the humor is hit or miss; it just feels out of place.\n\nOverall, Endgame wraps up the Avengers ark reasonably well, but it's too arrogant and lacks any real sense of quality.",
        "So bad they shoukd of thought about this for lonher",
        "All over the place & all in all very dissapointing - even some of marvel characters have morphed into embarrassing caricatures. Is it the writers fault or have some of the actors got a bit too much influence? ..... I don't get what planet anyone who gives thos film 5/10 is living on let alone all the 9/10 and 10/10 rating ... The mind boggles ....",
        "This was a terrible movie, no one and convince me otherwise. Over hyped and with a poor storyline. There were some good moments and scenes, sure. But overall? No. Just no.",
        "Nowadays it is like a crime to say bad things against Marvel movies but someone has to tell the truth This movie is extremely over-hyped. The first 2 hours there was almost no action, it was unnecessary endless dialogs, flashbacks and seconds chances. When we thought we gonna see some action, it took 30 min only. And then back to aftermath dramas again. I like dramas and deep stories in the movies but we already know these characters stories. why to over-extend that much? Acting was empty and going nowhere, CGI was almost none since there was a limited action. If it was up to me i would wait for torrents buy my gf wanted to see so much and in the end she also got disappointed.",
        "The idea of the film is there. What killed the movie overall was the writing and the poor choices made by the director. I get that they wanted to pander to the younger kids that were 12 or younger but went to ridiculous lengths to do so that killed any reason for anyone over the age of 30 to like it beyond being happy that their children liked it.",
        "Most cringe worthy superhero movie I've seen. I was eye-rolling most of the time. Near the end I was just hoping for it to finally end. I mean, where to begin, is totally messy and nonsensical! All the time travel doesn't make sense at all. After all the hype I'm so mad at how bad it was.",
        "Infinity war was amazing... this... nope. Hollyweird just doesn't know how to finish a story anymore. Paint by numbers and submit to a committee. Was it bad? No. Was it good? No. Robert Downey Junior is the only good thing in this film.",
        "So....boring. Bad CGI, lazy writing and just an all out disaster. Huge fan of the MCU, but this is the worst one by far.",
        "What a boring, predictable excuse for a movie. I'm so glad I resisted the hype and didn't suffer through this in the theaters. It's obvious this movies reviews are artificially inflated on this site, just look at all the other negative reviews.",
        "If you are a 7 years old kid or you have a 7 years old mind you will love this movie ...",
        "The previous episode was , ad least entertaining ...this one is just SO boring and sometimes so depressing ...3 hours trying not to yawn and more difficult , not to fall asleep ( Hopefully the fluctuation of the sound level between dialog scene and action one help me not to ! )\n\nPS : there's a good new , though , it's supposed to be the last one !",
        "Just try to imagine someone who didn't watch the 22 previous Avengers movies, watching this movie.\n\nIt's just totally incomprehensible.\n\nAnd even for someone (like me) who watched the previous movies, how can I remember all the details after 11 years ?\n\nToo many characters and too much talkings, this movie is BORING ! A pile of private jokes doesn't make a good movie.\n\nI give 3 stars for the last 20 minutes. Just for the SFX, but I don't understand who fighting who and why.",
        "I'd tell the story I saw but it was all so confusing. I can't believe how high the garbage has been rated!!! I have seen every marvel movie that has been release and watched and liked Infinity war though I thought it dragged on. No super hero movie should ever go for more than 2 hours...EVER. Now it has dawned on me that disney and the writers of this flick had nothing but cash in mind when planning these. The first Avengers was amazing, i believed that age of ultron was the forerunner for something epic with Thanos then these 2 movies were just a massive let down but it's all about cash and I took the bait. Hook, line and sinker. A final movie is supposed to give all the answers but this just gave me so many questions and left me confused and wondering whether I loved or hated it. Now it has sunk in and I gave it thought i just hate it. Too many contradictions. Don't get me wrong. The action is good in this movie and there are parts I loved about it but the parts i hate out weighed them. Damn you Disney!!!!",
        "The film has too many references to previous Marvel films, and is not friendly to those who are not Marvel fans. General audiences may easily get confused: what is this and why is that? The story is not original either. We have seen too many time-travel films, such as Back to the Future and Days of Future Past. This film does not offer anything new. Besides, the last thirty minutes are kind of redundant, and the overall running time is unnecessarily long.",
        "... and what let down! Slow to develop and fast and furious action in the end. The whole story line was awful and the ending pretty much may have been the \"endgame\" for me, in watching it any further. You may have to watch it to understand the future development - with new heros and old ones gone - but this has now become more of a \"transformer\" type kid series. So bye, bye for me.",
        "This movie is pure awesomeness. This is a movie, i will be remembered for eternity. Just a big thanks. Cinema was never so much entertaining. Can't wait for blu ray disk",
        "20 movies raised up my expectation from marvel, but the endgame was just a photo album of many actors and actresses who played in a movie with too much dialogues, minimum action scenes, childish plot, flat jokes and predictable events. I had two reservations for this weekend and canceled the other one as soon as I came of theater.",
        "Absolute deconstruction of original characters and the universe, this nonsensical circus seems only aiming to cram as much \"political correctness\", painful attempts at humor and cheap pathos into torturous 3 hours. One can only wish for infinity gauntlet to snap away the bad acting, horrible scenario and hollywood itself.",
        "This is hopefully the end of this long standing, inconsistent, money spinning series. And it's also the worst of them all. First hour or so...one or two fight scenes. The rest is back slapping in jokes that you'd have to memorise all the other films to get, long drawn out pointless 'science' scenes or 'hilarious' takes on each characters' past dislike of each other (didn't two used to fancy each other? It's like that never happened), and oh yeh the characters all change...like all the time. Remember when this one was bad and this one was good? Not anymore! And what is with their hair?! At the initial meeting to discuss the film concept did someone just say \"hair. Too benign. Let's jazz that up a bit\" because it's as if one of the Avengers is Vidal Sassoon all of a sudden.\n\nThis should be buried in a pit for future generations marked \"stop watching after Age of Ultron\"",
        "Plot holes everywhere, cheesy lines,basically the average superhero movie and no one sees how bad it is because they're blinded by hype, endgame was a mediocre poorly thought out rushed movie that feels more like a cashgrab",
        "It lacked many of the major events that we were wanting for",
        "The storyline being absolutely terrible is almost unrepairable. However, they do try and fail. The bjg problem is it's finally clear the choppiness and flow are off due secrecy and too much outsourcing. In order to obacure the plot, different companies are awarded different CGI scenes without ever being told the whole enchilada so that they can't leak anything... Of course this method requires there to be a very strong movie plot to begin with or you end up with chop suey. This movie has a few moments of good laughs and one liners... And that's it. It's a total and complete failure.",
        "Too many cringe worthy moments. Too much talking not enough action. This is superhero movie, not looking for bloodly oscar performance. Time travel thing was silly nonsense. I felt like walking out.",
        "As the title says. You know you have reached a dead end when you introduce time travel to resolve things. It works fine in shows that focus on it like Quantum Leap or Sliders but its usually a sign that you cant write worth a darn if you bring it into something else. That and alternate universes etc. They have been done to death and back and are just a plot device to overcome bad writing.\n\nSo anyway, I still gave this a 5 because the CGI and fight scenes were fun. Unfortunately, that is about all there is to say about this movie. It was pretty hollow. The only source of comedy came with the introduction of smart hulk who was just funny conceptually more than anything else. Otherwise, I actually thought that this movie made all the other movies worse because... time travel...\n\nIts a shallow movie. Not worthy of its rating in the least.",
        "I read the user reviews before I saw this movie. I thought perhaps the negative reviews were a bit unfair. But no! The cinema was filled to the max- I have never seen this before! Today's paper reported it is the highest grossing movie in history! Why? The audience were enraptured, laughing at seemingly unfunny moments, and cheering when good guy characters emerged. I think everyone drank the kool aid! Most of the movie is ordinary and just like other Avenger movies. Special effects were used to insert characters in cameo roles. Nothing new here folks! I have tried to analyze its popularity and have concluded that it is really simple to please the masses. People dont want complex scifi, a simple good- bad guy formula with a touch of routine comedy, good looking actors made more attractive with special effects touch ups, and some character familiarity will do the trick. Throw in a lot of multicultural references and political correctness and voila! Big bucks.",
        "I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess.",
        "A complete let down as they tried to turn End Game into some family comedy bit. They should have stopped at Infinity War.",
        "More than 3h of \"yes sure...\" BS. The franchise is at its end and CGI won't rescue it.",
        "Boring, horrible cartoonish CGI, terrible action scenes. So predictable and does nothing to keep you captivated. Horrible movie.",
        "Endgame has such a special place in my heart, it's so beautiful, but at the same time so painful to watch. The storyline is overall amazing and the characters is so amazing. Everything about this movie is incredible. This movie has it all , those cute comforting scenes, action scenes and fights, those scenes when you just can't stop crying it has it all. Endgame is such an experience. This movie is and I think will always be the turning point of marvel.",
        "Honestly felt like a completely different film from Avengers Infinity War. In fact the film had such a different tone from all the Marvel films before.\n\nThe characters changed, the story line was poor. Incredibly disappointing end to phase three",
        "No Spoilers This movie epitomises why I no longer pay to go to the cinema. It must be a free ticket and I must be bored. Those are my two criteria. It is therefore quite ironic that this film is boring. Was I not clear in my criteria. I said \"I must be bored\". NOT I want to see a BORING film! I quite enjoyed Infinity Wars to some extent but this film was just plain stupid. It must have been written by the children of the directors. It's that bad. I tried to tolerate this film as much as possible, started falling asleep then pinched myself and thought, \"what tf am I doing here?\" and walked out!",
        "Quite possibly the worst Avengers film in the series. Plot holes in every single scene, bland and cold acting. Sad really!",
        "There isn't too much in the way of suspense or surprises when it comes to the story, but there are some shocking moments and funny lines in this epic finale. Again, like many of the best Marvel films, the holes and flaws are covered up with humor and fan service, making everything okay. That being said, I did prefer Infinity War to this film, which really misses the leads of the other Marvel franchises that were \"snapped\" out. Overall, however, there are only a few ways you can wrap up the main story of the MCU, and this was a solid direction.",
        "Waste of money and time full of depressive heroes who cry like little babies for 5 full years. The prior is 100 times better than this crap with mediocre lines, but I guess that this is what the masses ask for...",
        "Constant stupid jokes, annoying cgi, fake deaths, predictable outcomes, product placement, no sense of danger, self indulgent ending, idiotic fan service, brainless action, and cliche-ridden idiocy is the best way to describe this film. It is fast food for the brain. If you want to take your kids to a fun movie, skip endgame, take them to Ford vs Ferrari. It may be just as sad at times, but it is based off a true story and has great acting, intelligent humor, a fantastic script, and heartwarming moments. It is enjoyable for everyone, and it doesn't have to be as idiotic as this trash to get people to enjoy it. Scorsese is right.",
        "It was suppose to be the most anticipating movie for any marvel fans after waiting for over a decade, but alas the story line was just repeating itself, rather lets just call it Avengers: Endgame repeated stories from the past films! time travel was another huge disappointment! shows real lazy writing, screen cast etc! there are more than 14 million ways the screenwriter and director could have made it different! a few punch lines and the end fight was only worth the money spent for watching it! as a whole i would just say sorry marvel you just lost it ! please don't bring back anymore of your films! you just lost a huge fan after watching this crap! sayonara Marvel, and i hope nobody watches your upcoming stupid spider-boy with a dumb brain!",
        "I went into this movie fully expecting that it can't top infinity war and I was mostly right but it was still a great movie and had an amazing climax and a way to end the series.",
        "I managed to watch 40 minutes of this crap, and then could not stand it any longer. You must be a true fan of Marvel Universe to see it until the end. If you are not, avoid - nothing makes sense in this utterly boring movie. Acting is really bad too. High-end special effects cannot save it.",
        "Wow horrible weak Story..i feel like am watching epic movie and Meet the Spartans.......\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12 don't waste your time watching this!",
        "Personally as person who isn't too much into all this comic book stuff, I watched this and it wasn't even mediocre. This was a terrible movie. The drama, characters and action all where really bad. There were still some good scenes in the movie, however over the 3 hour long movie, most of it was terrible. A lot of the acting felt forced, especially with the female superhero actors. There was not a good presentation or an interesting and surprising ending. Not to mention the terrible comedy spread throughout the film. Constantly repeating jokes that were not funny, and lots of references that were rather unfunny and forced.\n\nThis felt like a nerdy fan film sequel to the really good movie, infinity war.",

        "This is a good movie in terms of all its technical background but there is a lack of feel and energy throughout the film except for the scenes towards the end. You just needs to sit and wait patiently for the final battle. If you are a Marvel fan then you will enjoy it like any other Marvel films otherwise it can get sort of boring surely an overrated film.",
        "It was just amazing! Incredible, epic, emotional, action-packed and awesome! I wonder how it will all go on after this... Not since the wnd of Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings have I been so excited for an ending saga. I can't wait for what is next. An all female Avengers? Hopefully!",

        "Not one time did the scene after a scene make sense or have anything to do with the previous scene. I know this was a kids movie really but wow. I wish luck to all that come after me. The future is not bright. Maybe one of you can stop this. I feel like I watched 4 different movies all just settiny up movies to suck more moneu from my wallet but im done. Chris Pratts likeability will no longer fool me into beliveing this film series has a heart. It does not. It is evil personified. Hollywoods sins on a silver platter.

        "I was so excited to see this movie. 1.5 hours later I walked out from sheer boredom. First movie I have ever walked out of. If it was a normal length feature, I would have suffered through the whole thing, but knowing I have another 1.5 hours to go made me want to cry in misery. I left my husband and ran errands ... THAT is how boring it was.\n\nBoredom aside, there were so many eye rolling moments that left me surprised with the praise this movie received. AND if you have ever studied physics and the theories of time travel ... I'd suggest you do yourself a favor and leave this for the flat earthers.",
        "Terribly disappointed in the effort. There should have been something \"more\". The movie plods from scene to scene with no real tension, almost as if marvel is giving the viewer the cliff notes on the last 10 years of films. Even the end battle was snooze-worthy, including the mostly useless Captain Marvel showing up as the deus ex machina.",
        "If you have such wealth of acting at your disposal but reduce most of your cast to cameo appearances the story suffers. Some of the cameos were great to watch, they are the world's best known actors after all, but to me it was just a bit too much of everything and I lost interest when I lost count of all the characters, plots and subplots. I think I like it better when they focus on one or a few superheroes. High points of the movie: any scene with Tony Stark or Thor, but why use a star like Nathalie Portman when all she has to do is look pretty and walk around a bit, it makes you wonder whether these stars are short on money though. My grandson loved it though.",
        "I haven't nt seen all the Marvel movies, but I've seen some - the Iron mans, the Ant mans, Cpt Marvel. I enjoyed them. I thought I'd go and see what the fuss was about. However this, is so formulaic, ridicilous and boring I couldn't take it for the whole film. I walked out after 2 hours, and it felt every bit as long as that. If you're not a huge Marvel fan already, you may well not like this film, because I feel it's somewhat self-indulgent. It's like an effort to squeeze a bit more money out of fans.",
        "Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point. In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements... The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on. Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out.",

        "Not fair to Thor. 5/10 Cheesy jokes and So conclusion. Just A Business Movie on Super Hyped Fan base.",
        "Just some super heroes whining the whole movie. Such an example!",
        "I'm sorry but this movie was boring except for the last part. Infinity war was well balanced and every character had a role. Also had action from beginning to end. But endgame mostly had unnecessary talks or travelling here and there. Most main characters don't even have any fight scenes. Whole movie is focused on only 2-3 characters. Rest of the characters were in it like they just have a cameo. Should have made a semi team up film after infinity war and then Endgame with all the characters having enough screentime. Wasted opportunity.",
        "I always thought it was going to be almost impossible to improve on Infinity War... and I think I've been proved right. This was always going to be a film all about how the good guys could return to winning ways after getting their proverbial @as kicked in infinity war. Yes we probably wanted to see some of the aftermath of half the universe being wiped out....but it didn't need to play out for so long. To be honest I dislike most films when time travel becomes involved...I just think it all becomes a bit \"well nothing really matters as we'll just go back in time and change it\". I've watched infinity war 8 times already... but i just can't imagine ever sitting through this that many times. My honest opinion is it's too long....some of the main characters are just either disappointing or none existent. Another issue..if you have a character as powerful as Captain Marvel the rest of the squad become a bit redundant...unless you a again decide to send her to the other side of the universe. Some people will kid themselves that this is the peak of the whole journey.....its not...it already happened in infinity war.",
        "Even whilst watching it, I felt disappointed: slow, wordy, sloppy storyline. Even the final battle was excessive to the point of tedious: too much fast cutting and too many unnecessary characters. Despite enjoying and appreciating most of the Marvel films, I felt this was a letdown.",
        "It's rewind time everybody! I hate this movie. Go away.",
        "By no stretch of the imagination does this movie deserve a spot next to Dark Knight, Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Inception, Shawshank Redemption or any where within the top 100 movies. It was alright. Not revelatory. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. That was awesome. They captured the emotion perfectly, it was sad, but appropriate. This had some feel-good moments with massive collaboration from most of the entire universe. Also, this movie could possibly have elevated to an 8 if they put Deadpool in...that would have been awesome and hilarious. It was not overly thought-provoking. It was just a little above the average popcorn Marvel movie-nothing truly profound, just fun verbal quips and too much fighting and too many missions that somehow ends alright (not amazingly though).",
        "It's definitely not as strong an impression as it was on first viewing, which makes perfect sense, but I still think the film was extremely successful on multiple levels. One of the better things is that the three-hour film is not boring at any point, it seemed to me to last \"only\" two hours, which is not easy to achieve. I also look at this film as the finale or the last episode of a series you've been watching for years, which on the one hand is actually true. So much has happened before this film, so many characters and events. This film is just the crown of it all, one big rounded whole. It is obvious that the Russo brothers had a plan because it is obvious that they paid attention to details and some smaller moments that real fans will easily recognize. Of course I have some objections that are related to certain characters and some scenes, but given the type of film and how much the film offers, I can just get over it and forget about it. I think this Marvel project is unrepeatable and it's something we should appreciate no matter what you think of movies like this.",
        "First 2 hours of nothing with stupid humor just to make some children laugh and then while getting closer to the final battle... Still the same one liners to make us laugh... I won't even mention the storyline and it's plot holes... Everything in this movie is wrong... The Endgame destroys whatever marvel was building for 12 years!!! It's a disgrace and great disrespect to all our favorite heroes who are portrayed as a parody of themselves (Thor and Hulk especially)... This film is clearly not made for marvel fans.. Such a shame... Because for me last year's AVENGERS film was simply the best superhero movie of all time... The Endgame unfortunately was just a family comedy... \ud83d\ude20",

The aspects i usually like in this series is the humor and fun. This one didn't have almost any jokes and the storyline, is (as usual) pretty idiotic. There was not even any sophistication in the plot, just ... three hours of nothing. i don't rate it with 1/10 just because there were a few well done landscape shots...\n\nCome on, earth, stop spinning... i want to get off...",
        "Problem with time travel is if your not careful you make the whole plot impossible to believe. End game doesn't even come close to tieing up its loose ends. The remaining avengers act selfishly and arragently to the point you want them to fail.\n\nThanos did nothing wrong. I hated this film.",

I reached over to the empty seat beside me and took my phone out from my inside jacket pocket. That has never happened to me before. Not ever. How can this be the sequel to IW? One scene had all the women jump into battle at the same time. What woke bs is this? That scene was pure cringe. And laughably bad. My actual rating is minus 1.",
        "If you like spending three hours listening to explosions and ridiculous plot then this is the movie for you.",
        "I'm not going to bother watching any more of these Marvel movies. Each one seems worse than the last, and there's way too much CGI. It's not like most of them are more than a 5/10 anyway, and that's being generous. I can't wait until one of them bombs at the box office, so that we can stop getting constant special effects demo tapes and watch some real movies. Death to cgi!",
        "Good story. Exciting battle. Marvel fans mustn't have been spoiled before watching this. But it may be not so friendly to newcomers. If the 181 minutes were full of excitements that would be definitely ok but actually there're a significant amount of quiet and peaceful moments, puzzling people who watch Marvel film for the first time. I don't know how would a Marvel fan judge them.",
        "This movie is awful. Shot very badly, the editing gives you a headache and doesn't show any movement of the camera. I'm not particularly a fan of the other avengers but this is a total bore all the time except the last quarter of an hour where there is action but thinking about it even the ending is stupid.",
        "So i just watched it for the second time yesterday and i have to be honest this movie is boring as hell until the final fight and now that I watched it for the second time the final fight was ok this movie is so overated in my eyes firat time i watched it i was nearly falling asleep in theater because nothing intersting was happenning people going to hate me for this but I dont care I had more fun watching Dark Phonenix then this boring ass movie mcu movies are so overated in my opinion!",

Lord of the Rings and Avatar remains my all time favorite. My advice to all those who havent watched the movie yet, please do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD. It is highly likely that you will feel wasted like me, so at least you will have saved the money.",
        "This film did nearly every Marvel/MCU fan justice. To see the epic conclusion of the Infinity Saga spanning for over 10 years\n\nThe film itself is great. The usual cast and crew teamed up to produce such an awesome film. The story could've maybe been more exciting during the middle. But that climax scene, wow! Definitely watch this film (but you need to watch every MCU film first)",
        "Utter garbage. The Russo brothers & Kevin Fiege are quite literally the worst thing to happen to cinema.",
        "Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe I expected more elegant & complex solutions. But what this movie gave to me was huge disappointment - with a little fun here & there (mostly includes Thor). In the end, Infinity War remained as far more better movie.",

I wont even go into the all the plot holes and no sense paradoxes as i'm sure many have already done but what a sad ending to a wonderful journey? and please Disney, please lay off on the Wokey preaching crap its getting tedious, lets just have a good story eh and leave the politics to the Politicians?",

        "I honestly don't understand what people liked in this movie. There was too much inspiration from a third class chick flick, with completely useless emotional scenes from super heros who don't really inspire any emotions. Acting and dialogs were also terribly executed. The movie could have easily be completed in half an hour without losing any content.",

All I'm going to say is:\n\nThe crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie.",

LOTS and LOTS of drama, moaning and crying again and again.\n\nSo, to sum it up: * Plot holes not even the biggest fans can ignore. * Inconsistencies between the movies. * Way too many characters, just to appear on the movie, doing basically nothing. * Huge changes to main characters, making them also useless. * Almost no fight scenes! Set the alarm clock after 120min in the movie. * Drama, crying, moaning, REPEAT.\n\nYou have been warned, but it doesn't matter because you will ignore all the negative reviews and still go and see the movie. That's what i did, the same mistake. Go grab a pizza and watch Arrow, trust me you'll have better time.",
        "Marvel, since under Disney management, fails in innovating and goes for the safe route of recycling its blockbusters. The movie feels like a weird mix of burger, pizza, skittles and Ben&Jerries. Very disappointing of Marvel.",
        "This wasn't just bad as in disappointing, it was one of the worst films I've ever endured. I was enjoying it until 'time travel', and from then on it spiralled downwards until it hit rock bottom. Just terrible. You know how Iron Man 3 was unwatchable? Well imagine that, but a hundred times worse and even longer. It amazes me how someone, at some point, gave this the green light to be made and then wasted $350million on this disaster. It's difficult to know where to start with this insufferable abomination, but I guess it must just be me as it made a ton of money at the box office and seems to get decent reviews. If this is an indication of the standard of where the Avengers movies were heading, then good riddance. The proof in what I'm saying is the appallingly bad 'Spider-Man Far From Home', which is also one of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune to see. I give it one star for the last 20 minutes where the series was wrapped up. Disney, please don't inflict any more of this garbage on the world.",
        "This movie has a terrible plot and could be the worst movie I've ever seen",

        "Watch it honestly. My 5th grade sexual harassment class had more relevance then this. And I made the mistake of buying it.",
        "OMG! What have I just watched? Remake of Avengers: Infinity War?\n\nThe last installment of Avengers looks like another Infinity War with table turning (this time we won) and introduction of few new elements such as Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and time machine. The rest is pretty much the same: whole lot of super-heroes doing crash-smash-flash-zap-bang super-fictional thing we already seen in earlier Avengers. OK, have to admit CGI is awesome but if you strip that the result is below average movie to watch once and leave in archive (if you mistakenly bought disc).\n\nBottom line, I really don't see End Game as a \"Masterpiece\" just because it filled-up box office emerging on top of all movies. It is not something we have not seen before, no breakthrough, not better than Infinity War. Just good advertising boosted this up on hall of fame scale.",
        "I watch all films with an open mind and went into this 3 hour long film without any preconceptions.\n\nThis film really let itself down. The writers completely changed some of the characters, they tried to make it funny and failed at every attempt where it was cringe worthy and boring. The story was dragged out to its limit and went on for way to long.\n\nDon't waste your money at the cinema, maybe Google the outcome.",
        "It is overrated movie - and not in the same level as infinity war. I think the two movies could have been merged into one 3 hrs movie and spare us the hype of 13 years old fans all over the world.\n\nIt is not worth it.\n\nMost of the parts are slow paced and dull, and the action sequences are not new or even surprising.\n\nFull of cinematic cliches.",

        "This one star review is necessary to bring you sheep back to reality. This movie was a boring mess and a major letdown. Infinity War was far better, and that isn't saying much. All of these Marvel films except for a handful out of the 22, 23, however too many have been made-have the same feel by the time credits roll. The MCU's true legacy is showing how if a studio can keep audiences laughing, they'll shut their brains off and ignore the inanity (inanity not insanity, clarification for the lemmings) in front of them.",
        "All i want to say that. Take away 22 movies and a fanbase from endgame. It is nothing but a pile of dust. Endgame stands on the base of Marvel reputation. Alone, its trash. Silly and total cringe. Thanks for making Thor a clown. Its just for memes",
        "The dumbing down of Hulk and ruining his character by turning him into an utter wimp, turning Thor into a bumbling drunkard, really? Well done Disney on ruining yet another couple of hero's characters (See Luke Skywalker and Yoda in Disney's Last Jedi for extra confirmation of this) That's all I've got to say about this movie.",

I'm also just tired of seeing the SAME old mad man trying to destroy the world and getting defeated by super heroes. Too many characters.\n\nAt least with the Dark Knight and some of the X-Men films they mixed it up and felt fresh. More superheroes doesn't mean better. Plus the acting was atrocious. The wooden repartee didn't help, done only to make sure everyone gets their lines in.\n\nTry a new storyline and/or approach. SKIP IT!",
        "It is the movie that I expected to see after 21 episodes that were shaping a great saga on the way. It's what I expected to see, after they've invested over $ 350 million doing it. And it's definitely what I was hoping to see to dramatically close a franchise that, in my opinion, should take a break so as not to saturate the genre.\n\nAlthough James Cameron deserves to be on the podium of the best of the film industry forever, if Endgame gets to surpass Avatar, it is deserved.\n\nThis movie goes straight to my top 10 favorites movies of all time.",
        "The curtain call of the Avengers is entertaining if painfully convoluted and long. Unlike most of its predecessors, \"End Game\" is over done in the same vein as the Star Wars franchise. It's a disappointment compared to most of the prior Marvel films. I own most of those movies on Blue Ray. I will not be purchasing either of the last Avengers films.",
        "After a historically shocking setup, this beautifully imperfect movie really stuck the landing. It's an accomplishment many franchises just couldn't do (ie Game of Thrones, Star Wars sequel trilogy) but Marvel pulled it off, which just has to be recognized as special. Our OG Avengers end their stories here in a film that balanced fun, humor, and sheer emotion very well. I've never experienced such feelings or had such fun in a movie theater. It truly felt like I was living through history. My favorite Marvel film.",
        "This film was too long. The dialogues were boring and formalistic Overall it represents the maximum of mediocrity. It felt pretty much like when you eat too much candy.",
        "It's hard to believe that this is the highest grossing movie of all time. It's not even that good of a Marvel movie.\n\nI understand that this is based on a comic book characters but damn! The fact that this movie is so successful is pretty much the reason why Hollywood thinks they can get away making movies that aren't all that well thought out but look cool. The first hour was downright painful to get through and if they had taken out a lot of the unnecessary crap, this movie easily could have been 2 hours long.",
        "I.ll be brief and say some spots were amazing wont spoil but there were times that just totally ruined it ... Captain Marvel and her im the best dead pan delivery was horrendous...and THOR lol wtf happened to that very very poor showing of a bad ass charater who deserved way more then this ..same goes with HULK... was a delight to watch but no way does it capture the pacing and character development of infinity war .. and that battle scene will go down in marvel movie history as one the best epic finales to a movie EVER.... SNAPPP...",
        "It was unexpected, infinity war was really different to this but I like this concept, since it has to do with time travel we get to adventure back in the MCU, infinity war was the big 10 year film and this was part 2, instead of being a giant action film there was also time traveling witch means we can go a trip down memory lane and see some of the past of the MCU, this makes for a great big movie that has had this much leading up to it. The climax was also really awesome, it was just the biggest fight ever! Generally a different movie than infinity war, but still solid.",
        "Nothing really happening ....Captain Marvel is in it for a bit...Black Panther was in it too, not sure why\n\nDramatic scenes purely over the top....just seems like they tried to fit all 5000 Avengers into this film and actually forgot about the film\n\n3 hours, I'll never get back .......one good battle scene tho",

It is inefficient to change things and not have them improve the outcome.\n\nI thought some of the action scenes were good and yes, I shed a tear when so-and-so died, but meh, too many people, too many deus ex machina and sloppy writing makes everything else seem tarnished.\n\nAnd they could have done with less.\n\nI originally gave 3 stars but I bumped it to 4 for making me feel sad when I said I wouldn't.",

        "Badly made. First hour felt like thrown together in few minutes. Some jokes just went out too far, I was really hoping them to go away towards the end... But no. Many characters simply ruined forever, which makes no sense. I did not enjoy the movie Most of the people will say this is good because of the Fan hype. I'm a Marvel fan all the way, but this just wasn't it.",
        "This guy is a horrible actor and ruins the whole experience",
        "Spectacle and nothing else as fans said here its meant to be for them but even they dont like it totally undermines the excellent previous movies for too much fanservice and useless plot threads that go nowhere sadly ive seen this movie twice and regretted it both times such a slack way to wrap up what was mostly a good-excellent run of movies",
        "That is a typical example of a movie trying to squeeze juice out of a story that falls short. X-men finished their old-cast franchise so much better, and darker, and better (sorry did I say better before...), yeah much better. Endgame is simply not up to par with the rest of the Marvell movies.",
        "Too long for bad plot. The movie is 3 t 1 min use your time better!",
        "This movie was awful; the acting was abhorrent, the special effects looked like a spy kids movie, and the plot was verging on completely ludicrous. I was ready for a simple popcorn flick, but this movie committed the worst crime of all; it was horrendously boring.\n\nThis film had zero depth, the characters were two dimensional, and the jokes mostly fell flat for me. The actors looked bored, and at times there was more green screen than the Star Wars prequels. Worse still, there were times where it felt like certain actors weren't even on set at the same time as the others, and it was all edited together afterwards.\n\nI wish I had the infinity glove so I could click my fingers and cut this movie by 50% of its runtime.",
        "The fact that this movie still has a 9.2 rating really says a lot about the fans. They must either be 10, or have extremely low movie standards.\n\nAlso, the unnecessary and overwhelming immature jokes gave me cancer.",
        "Ok. So. Endgame yaaay I am hyped goes to watch starts getting impatient. The pace was wayyyy tooo slow. Maybe this is because it is last movie of Phase 3? The movie was slow paced and then at the end everything rushed. IMO Infinith War was wayy better. I think it shouldve been half of the time length of the 3h.",
        "They open the story and characters very widely so closing the chapter was a mess. Too much drama (poor one) main characters was missing. They gave role of Thor to captain america and hulk as carton green man. Worst avengers and really it's an end game (just a game).",
        "The movie picks storyline at its own convenience. Impossible things become possible at the noise orchestra. My biggest complain is that there is no coherence especially how do you quantity powers of these super heroes ? Just hit smash and do it all over again.",
        "This was a fun movie, but it was by means no where near a 10/10. Infinity War was a much better movie to be honest. It had way better action and a better story. End Game's plot was a mess. Overall, it was an entertaining and fitting end to an era, but was by no means perfect.",
        "I loved all the other movies..but I'm not sure I can even finish watching this...3hours of not getting to the damn point already...",
        "I'm a dc fan but i love the hell out of it ! The movie was slow but wasn't boring at all and i enjoyed every second of it. One of the best in the MCU.",
        "I really couldn't understand the plot and for me it was a watch once only.\n\nI enjoyed solo movies \ud83c\udfa5 like Iron Man Ant Man Spiderman Thor Dr Strange etc\n\nToo many cooks spoil the broth!\n\nAdvice : Go and watch SHAZAM for a better movie experience and a good laugh \ud83d\ude00\n\nEnjoy the Bank Holiday!\n\nKarim Sumar",
        "I can only agree with Martin Scorsese. This isn't cinema. It is worse than watching a documentary. The whole saga was drawn out for so long, with just awkward feeling movies, and a pitiful ending. If you think this movie is good, go watch a real movie, like The Godfather or Dark Knights trilogies. If you make more than 3 movies in a franchise, the quality will be just as bad, if not worse than the Fast and Furious series.",
        "I'm honestly shocked by the amount of negative reviews of this movie, not because some people didn't like it but the by the over the top exaggeration of their expectations of how this series should end. You'd think it was the worst movie ever made and it's no where near that, everyone is entitled to their opinion but I'm not buying the absolute disgust that many are expressing, it had to end there's no way around it but don't bash it because you were expecting something different, the good guys won, you couldn't be surprised by that could you.",
        "What a cinema experience. Saw this opening night and the cheering that erupted at certain points gave instant goosebumps. A couple of legendary moments in the movie that I will never forget. Nothing has come close and I feel like nothing else ever will. Over 20 movies have led to this, and Endgame delivered big time.\n\nThere really isn't much else to say. The movie is packed full of every emotion. One simply has to have made the great journey to appreciate this masterpiece. This is the peak of the MCU and I fear it will only decline, but time will tell.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.",
        "Oh my God! This movie is horrible... stupid story. They \"stuffed\" all the superhero characters, but why? The story did not better because of it. Confused, silly movie. I hate it.",
        "Horrible, wrapping things up for the sake of wrapping things up. Random stuff thrown together with no meaning or story.",
        "Not bad but it's the weakest avenger movie. It's just mediocre",
        "One of the \" MASTER PIECE \" from the team Avengers. This is combination of all movies released from the \" MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE\". This movie is a different type of story because the Avangers try to get back all the \" INFINITY STONES\" before \" THANOS \" Get all the stone to destroy the world and half the population of Earth.\n\nEXCELLENT STORY,E GREAT WORK , .\n\n\" A MUST WATCH MOVIE \".\n\nNB: \" TRY TO WATCH FROM THE BEGINNING OF ALL MOVIE'S FROM MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE\" I LOVE THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH....",
        "I went in with the highest expectations and came out underwhelmed and disappointed. its nowhere near as good as infinity war !!!",
        "I watched this movie for a second time and didn't realize before half way through that I already had seen it. I grew up reading comics and I enjoy good movies based on such - but this is not a good movie. Iron man, Guardians and Ant man - all have great movies and the start of Avengers also brought something exciting. Endgame is boring, lacks imagination and feels like a neverending wait for it to end. The main problem is that they try to make it epic and over the top righteous - and succeed cutting all emotional ties to the audience. See it so you can talk of it, but prepare to fast forward, fall asleep or a me - forget that you have seen it.",
        "I dont even wanna spend my time here writing how bad the movie and the story was, it was just soooooooooo awful",
        "Don't believe the reviews. I suspect it's people paid to do positive reviews. Either that or I saw a different movie! Nothing much happens for 2 hours. There was no plot to speak of and i could have written better dialogue! The soundtrack is the best thing about it seriously",
        "Let me first tell you that I am a big fan of the marvel movie franchise. Never read any comic book. I generally enjoy superhero movies.\n\nThis review would be disliked but I have to say this, this was the worst marvel movie after iron Man 2 for me. Some movies have loopholes in their script but this movie has some script in the loopholes. I guess this movie is getting such high reviews(near fight club and Lord of the rings) as people are emotional about the characters and they would think with their heart and not their brain. But if you actually think about the movie, that is , take your brain with you to the theatre, you would start observing the huge loopholes. And I do want to clear it out that I am not a person who is very picky about the story. I accept some flaws in a movie. But in this movie there are so many flaws that it becomes hardly acceptable. It was so bad that it killed all my interest in future superhero movies.",
        "Could have been better!!! marvel has a toxic fan base people freak out on lame jokes in the movie whenever something is going in with a good flow! Terrible CGi overrated poor storyline could've been better!",
        "Avengers Endgame - what a disappointment. Too long, too boring and too sappy. What was I watching - soap opera? Low on action, full on drama, corny dialogues about friendship and family. The hall was supposed to be houseful according to bookmyshow and PVR, bullshit, it had less than 1/4 seats full. Something very fishy is going on. Totally anti climactic after Infinity Wars and Thor Ragnarok. The direction Marvel has chosen after Captain Marvel and Now this. Seems like films are statistically driven now, with an eye on how to make the film click - by hook or crook. Captain Marvel - Woman driven, here too there is one scene clearly pushing that agenda. In the last battle there is a shot where all the woman get together for the final fight - just by chance. The entire focus for this move was, high on emotions, must have done some calculations for that is what the box office collection tell.\n\nIf I had got an honest review I would have given this movie a skip, you should too.",
        "Probably one of the worst Avengers movie to date. The plot was extremely childish and did not make sense. Completely went astray from the plot described in the comics. Very disappointed...",
        "Also watched GoT season 8 episode 3 (the long night*) after Endgame; let's just say I completely forgot about this final avengers movie. Literally that episode of GOT blows this movie away.\n\nMANY of the scenes weren't important/forgettable. Infinity War was just better, whatever the Russo brothers were ready to retire, therefore comic movies are going back to being crap.\n\nITS OVER, MCU as we know it will be feminized by Disney and going down the crapper. It was fun while it lasted, btw Captain Marvel is HORRIBLE, the movie, character, everything. Great new dyke haircut.",
        "I think Marvel films are fine, I understand loving them I really do. Spider-Man 2 is my personal favourite, but please stop giving these movies a 10/10. Endgame is a 7 at best. It's probably the most flawed Avengers film story wise. It's popcorn fun, but it's like if we let Fast & Furious or Transformers films in the top 250. Meanwhile 2001: A Space Oddisey is lower than Infinity War.",
        "It was normal movie but captain marvel ruined it. She was, very overpowered and she was strongest character. Adding her in this movie was very big mistake plot was coll tho but it wqs ruined by capitan marvel",

        "This has to be one of the most overrated films I've ever seen, it was long boring and tiring to watch. The story was boring slow and at times just felt unnecessary. I genuinely don't understand how people can say it was a 10/10 film.",
        "Seriously I am actually convinced now that nobody in the industry knows how to write an ending. they are so focused on leaving plot opening for a possible future opportunity that they cant give a satisfying ending! Game of thrones and the decline of Stranger things to mention a few.",
        "I can't believe this movie got a so hight raring. Even hours of this trash can't compete with 15 minutes of other masterpieces that sadly no one talks about. The average audience, who wouldn't even distinguish wes Anderson from Tarantino, cares to write unwarranted reviews, and the fact that the most famous platform in the world (and the last word on the success of a movie or not) allows it, in my opinion, It's an affront to the art of cinema.",
        "Maybe not the best mcu movie, but the one I find the most satisfying. Watching this in theaters for the first time was truly an experience. This is essentially 3 separate movies- a post apocalyptic drama (act 1), a time heist (act 2), and an epic (act 3). It may not hold up as well on rewatch, but there is nothing like watching this movie for the first time.",
        "The movie is just very bad writing and is an epic failure for it lacks a coherent acceptable digestible fathomable sensible reasonable story or plot .. just sucks so bad that it hurts So much is wrong that I can't begin .. but for some reason people are lying .. even critics",
        "Infinity War was a million times better than this trash",
        "This is a replica of guardian of galaxy. Too boring to watch.",
        "I saw this with my entire family in a theater. It was house full with too much clapping n whistling n some of the dialogues went bouncer. Will watch it again but I feel it is not on par with Infinity War. In Infinity War, the war sequence n the fight scenes were all shot in broad daylight n that too in an open field of Wakanda without the fast paced camera tricks. It was visible who was fighting who but Endgame's war sequence is shot in the dark with too much fast paced camera tricks. At times it became hectic to make out who is fighting who. The entry of Thor during the war in Infinity was epic but in Endgame it was duds. The entry of Captain America with the background sound to save Vision in Infinity War was again epic but in Endgame it is not at all exciting. Rocket's one liners were good though.",
        "The length of the movie increased with long talks, which makes almost no contribution to the plot or highlight heroes characters. Instead of Marvel usual excitement feeling (although I am not big fan of comics) you get the feeling was it worth to spend 3h. If the movie would be brutally cut to 1.5 it would be good end product by Marvel.",
        "Sry, but this isn't a 8,7 rating movie. I get that it's all doom and gloom with what happened in the last movie, but u don't drag that out for 2 hours. Main acts becomes sideshows, story is a mess. Put in a bit of woke and u release it. I will not rewatch this.",
        "Went into movie theater expecting an epic finale and a much better movie than infinity war; alas it was so anti climatic so boring so full of plot holes an elephant would've passed through them - or a hulk for that matter - very disappointing movie overall!!!",
        "Another generic Marvel film. Forced jokes. Lots of CGI. The Hulk is a complete joke in this movie (So is Thor), waste of a good actor and character. It's the ultimate Marvel movie, and we don't get to see Hulk go berserk? Totally lame. There was a lot of wasted opportunity in this film, it isn't by any means a great movie. Russo brothers are lame. This movie was so anticlimactic, Marvel tried so hard to give their characters heart and soul as they wrapped up the franchise. If you've seen this movie once there's no need to watch it again.",
        "I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but from my point of view Infinity War is way better than Endgame. I do feel like Endgame tried to copy some great scenes from Infinity War, yet those ones were miserably executed. The only thing amazing about Endgame is Captain Marvel and her new short haircut, but that's about all that shines on Endgame :(. I am really disappointed, I really hoped for something better and not that predictable. Unfortunately Endgame lies in a category of movies for which even the trailer is better than the movie..",
        "Poor plot, dialogue and characterisation. Don't bother",
        "First of all it's a very loooooooong movie. 3 hrs. I was waiting for this one for months now, so excited at what was going to come. But Alas.. What a mess. The first hour is a complete boring time of them showing what the world has come to. I mean quite boring with slight humor. Second hour, the movie starts picking up, with more content (confusing time travel) and some good humor. The last hour (like when you are actually asking where's the action, where are the effects, 3D etc), it's starts to show some hope. And some action starts. Gets you going.. For a bit.. And then it ends. The action is hardly there.. Whatever is there is forgettable. Nothing worth like the earlier ones. Overall the movie is not a little below average, with nothing memorable in it. I can't believe the business is done. I came home and had to watch Infinity War to get over this one. And believe me folks... Infinity War was way better than this. Way way better with its story and action. Don't waste your money on this melodrama.. Watch it on TV when it comes...",
        "A long and boring sleep fest that ruins the 10 or so years of build-up for a few key characters and is filled with more plot holes than there are superheroes in this cinematic universe. The final 30 minutes of this long journey is about the only part, aside from a few touching moments, that is worth watching. Quite a disappointing ending to such a praised saga.",
        "There is some amazing cgi in this movie but the feeling of ever smouldering \"I'm going to be a hero\" look soon betrayed the shallowness of this epic \"all for one, one for all\" nonsense. A score that does not deliver and the utter nonsense logic of \"time interference\" really lost my suspension of disbelief. I adored the last Thor movie but Holding out for Too many Heroes proved too shallow and nowhere near as Compelling as \"LOTR - Return of the King\".",
        "If you kept away from spoilers and you purchased your ticketto go see the long waited Endgame...well, you will might end up after 3 hours of watching it, just like me, dissapointed. I know I was! What a mess ! Of course it is intended to patch screenplay holes up, or cut ties with actors that are no longer part of the franchise... But , I mean, come on! Some of the make-up effects are just terrible, and yeah it is a very important Avenger with a very disturbing beard and wig to begin with! Plot, caracter developement, lines, ughh...my expectations dissapeared, you know, snap of fingers! 3 stars given for the few laughs here and there , my favorite characters and 1 epic battle !",
        "I expected so much from this film but just feel so disappointed by it. A poor and incoherent story with so many contradictions within it plus a total waste of my favourite character - amongst others (like Thanos himself). I did go and rewatch it in the cinema a second time and realised that, without all the excitement and expectation I went in with the first time I was just really really bored.\n\nIt did have some nice \"moments\", especially the anticipated big fight towards the end. Some characters get a good inning - love Antman and, of course, Iron Man but this is my least favourite MCU film.\n\nAnd the ending...........sigh!",

But it is still not great in any way. 1 good joke and just a bunch of revisiting past episodes, thats it. Thats End Game. They sure leaned on tear jerking hard, and it did get me a little with Nebula reaching out. but overall it just shows that going into time travel paradoxes can be funny or stupid.

I will not be watching this dribble again. Well unless it's on cable tv at Xmas day in 4 years time and I'm too full of dinner to get up and change the channel.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is everything the audience could ask for. Per usual with Marvel, the comedic tone is set up perfectly, the visual effects are stunning, and the acting is great with a spectacular casting. The dialogue is extremely meaningful, more so than any other MCU film to date. The plot is thrilling, saddening, and shocking all at the same time, which is perfect for a film of such magnitude. There are some flaws in the film, but they are not nearly pressing enough to warrant much criticism. This Phase 3 finale wonderfully serves truly beautiful conclusions to each character's story in this era, nailing all the smallest, yet extremely important minor details that capture how precise and thoughtful the 22 movie storyline has been. Overall, Endgame completes the MCU in a way that makes the franchise worth it, for everyone involved.",

        "Thank god it's all over.... Safe the worst for last. No more marvels please. 10 years is way too much and long.",
        "Please don't explain rules to a concept and then break them in the same movie. We are watching, we aren't stupid.",
        "The half part is boring, and its not really fun to see so many super hero, not a really good inspiring story or no story at all. Glad it finally ends.",
        "Glad I only wasted $4 watching this awful movie. 3 hrs I never get back . I really liked Guardian of the galaxy and infinity war . But this is just trash .",
        "Godawful movie. Took itself too serious. The girlpower bit was groan out loud cringe. Fat thor pointless. Half a hulk just annoying. Ending was longer than lord of the rings. Big fight scenes awful cgi. Everything got thrown at the screen and none of it stuck",
        "Kids wrote plot for the movie. Ppl are getting made for nothing",
        "Was well disappointed with this. I liked bits of it but I am finding difficulty recalling them.",
        "This movie is so long and boring don't understand where the hype is! Not any close to infinity war! Senseless! Please save your 3hrs! Trust me",
        "Utter crap - left the theater upset and exhausted. I hate everything about Brie Larson - she's ruining Marvel for me. Best character development for Thanos completely destroyed. Don't even get me started on Thor. Give 2 and not 1 for Cap and Stark.",
        "Endgame is a movie that makes the audience cry and laugh through the entire three hour long run time. It's laughably bad and sadly disappointing.",
        "This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. Visuals, the actresses and actors, and plot. Everything linked up. I love this film and would recommend it to anyone.",
        "This film was so poor I left feeling the whole MCU was less because of its existence. I now think twice before putting on any MCU film knowing that this is the Endgame.",
        "Saw it in 3d otherwise it would have been terrible. Too many superheros for my liking.",
        "After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story. I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War. I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story. There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others. The story is average at best with big flaws.",
        "Just watched this in fast-forward. i simply cannot digest this universe where in one hand high tech space travel magic creatures are living along with dump low tech planetlings , so i guess that the majority of the fans are identifying them self to those lowlifes. and the most irritating for me is how low modern they dress them self in this marvel universe.",
        "So boring and predictable story with cringe moments such a dissapointment",
        "Please don't waste your time on this...Its very boring. It's like they pre-sell the movie with a good ending of infinity war. Its a rip off. Trust me you won't believe this. I quite after 30 minutes.\n\nI am writing this review to alert people: keep your money and time for something else.",
        "Nothing special about this movie, its over rated there was no surprises in the whole film",

        "The strongest hero is kept out of the story and did not even explore her powers here.. \"Iron man Endgame\"",
        "Well. Went to see it opening night and came out so disappointed. Was reading reviews when going in (without the spoilers) that were so great only to be hugely disappointed!!! No spoilers in this review as none are really necessary. To much time on empty characters (Hawkeye), way to long to bring back the half that are gone so most of the movie was wasted with slow plots that will be destroyed in the end. The captain ending is stupid. How many holes are there now!!! And boring hulk!!!! Why???? Infinity war was on a different level and this just fell off from the beginning. I felt like when I watched the NEW Star Wars movies. Total waste and let down. I think they forgot what got them this far and just caved to making the almighty dollar in the end.",
        "Wost movie ever seen total waste of time no action no nothing just bad bad bad bad",
        "Boring rehashed rubbish. Too long! Too many characters again!! Seen it all before and now I am bored of Marvel and DISNEY!!!!",
        "A lot in Endgame was great but there were more than a few sub-par moments. There were numerous plotholes, including in relation to the major plot in the middle of the movie, they ruined several of the characters, and the final resolution was lame. And yes, there are about a dozen undeserved \"woke\" moments...",
        "Appallingly bad. Full of plot holes and convoluted action scenes. Maximalism for the sake of maximalism is not entertaining.",
        "A box office success, sure, not based on its merits though but rather that of its predecessors. Visually spectacular as we've come to expect from the Avengers franchise (and the only reason for the stars) otherwise unnecessarily long, bordering on boring and full of plot holes. A few endearing scenes and one major scene were the only semi-redeeming factors. Otherwise just SO SO disappointing **SOB**",
        "The most hyped up soap drama of all time. lots of nothingness and pointless battle Thanos just sucked in this movie",
        "A great sum up to all of the 23 movies. It has everything that anyone would want to watch. The 3 hour runtime is totally worth it.",
        "The writers went to far with this one.Somethings wrong with today's society,for ppl to even consider this garbage as one of the greatest films ever made with an of 8.5 is a disgrace.8.5?????seriously,this film is an abomination to marvel fans and the entire human race,there was no love and passion done with this it was only for money.I hate this film and I especially hate the writers who did this,this couldve been the greatest of the greats.",
        "Loved most of the first 22(?) films in the series. Endgame truly sucked. Decent acting, absolutely crap plot. I wish I'd never seen any of the film's in the series now.",
        "I mean not sure why these films get rated so high! getting almost 9/10 for a film which is a 7/10 at best. Didn't even finish watching all the film, are we really saying this film is on par with LOTR, Inception etc..",
        "Don't listen to the haters, it's amazing! Seriously, this is the movie of the year!",
        "After all the hype, I expected to be extremely wowed. But I left feeling kind of meh. It was extremely long and dragged in several places. I felt like Infinity War was better overall. Good movie but seriously overhyped.",
        "Really good first half. Dreadful second half. Really boring. About 50% as good as infinity war. Very disappointing",
        "Worst film of all time in the whole film industry.the most over hyped film ever in the world.absolutely disastrous and useless movie.",
        "They wanted to make a film and tell a story with CGI. They failed. Why are actors giving their faces for this? Its the only human thing left in it. Everything else is just CGI. Tells me nothing.",
        "A 3 hours Marvel film with 2.5 hours of drama, 15 mins of actions and 15 mins of something else.. seriously?\n\nTheir logic didn't make any sense.\n\nBesides, what they did to Thor was brutal.",
        "Unlike Infinity War, Endgame was there for only fan service, which is not something one should look for in a movie.",
        "I really don't understand how people think this film is amazing. I see the absolute bias when it comes to rating nowadays and the worst part is all these fan boys will be following the Russo brothers and rating their terrible films 10/10 each time.\n\nThis movie makes Infinity War look good ... and that was an absolute mess of a film too. I can't wait to see what kind of complete waste they will come up with next ......",
        "Seriously not getting what people like in this movie giving 10/10. This movie is horrible and very boring. Not expecting this from Marvel. It seems Marvel tried to make a cocktail of all hit formula in one movie to satisfy all type of audience. The end result - disaster. Worst movie of marvel ever made.",
        "I think End game is non sense How could they destroy the story by missing with time ! killing Thanos erase infinity war so End game is never happen and I wonder about Captain Marvel ..half the univ disappear and she was to busy or did not notice tell she had a missed call ..and once more she come to do nothing here ! come on ! I waited too long for this movie to understand why the \"heroes \" of infinity war give up willingly infinity stone to thanos however the know what he will do! but now never mind it is just a movie no story not a big deal p.s I liked what happen to ironman",
        "Watch this movie, it can be far worse! I understand that Infinity War set a high bar but this one is a joke; time travel, better known as \"deus ex machina\" for lazy writing, is primary thing here that was never explained.\n\nAnd trust me, that is the least of the problems!\n\nYes, the effects were nice so hence 2/10 but effects were never so important in Avengers; others at least had some sort of story and action, this one is dull.",
        "They throw everything and the kitchen sink and it is boring.\n\nThe story is so convoluted and starts as a Telemundo famiiy drama before becoming a mess of coincidences. The superheroes play a 5-minute tag sequence at one point.\n\nSigh.\n\nThor with an axe!!! Thor playing earth 21st century video games and drinking beer. I have nothing more to say.",
        "Please don't waste your time with this one. This movie was the worst, most cringeworthy waste of a good story I have ever seen.",
        "This movie isn't perfect. But i feel like Endgame is actually pretty amazing because it has more characters than any other movie and somehow manages to give a conclusive ending to all of them along with 11 years of the Infinity saga. Ngl, My life was complete when I saw the Portals scene.",
        "If you want to watch some visual eye candy, forget about character development, and story writing. Even throw away consistency and continuity, then be relieved when its over, then this is for you.\n\nToo many fan boys and sheep, following bought and paid for critic reviews. Good films have given way, to basically some pretty images smashed together, and so simplified yet terribly written scripts, that it basically makes no sense in even how the writers wrote it. I'm shocked and applaud at the good reviews for this.\n\nP.s. Diploma in film and television, and a degree in creative writing",
        "Enjoyable movie that takes to long to get into the action and doesn't make any sense once you step back and think about what they've done. Even their explanations on what they were going to do, what they did do, and the final outcomes make no sense. I believe the world would be an even bigger mess when they were done, and Steve broke all the rules!",
        "This movie is the best thing that ever happened.\n\nThank you marvel.\n\nI can't. I can't forget this movie. Zbsbdhhsbsbdbsdbbdbdndndnsndnsjdjjddjjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjjjdjdjdjdjdjdjd.",
        "I dont like the movie. It doesn't deserve to be in top 100 movie.",
        "These guys putting up fake reviews! End game is a waste of time and money! Weak story line! Hardly any action for thanos! Many things in the movie unexplained how they happened! Thor made a laughing stock! Why why! Big let down!",
        "Went into this very excited, came out very disappointed. The worst avengers film, possibly the worst marvel film. It was incredibly boring the only reason I'm giving it a 3/10 is the battle scene that was the only entertaining part of the film. I don't get all the hype around this film. The visual effects are amazing (just like all marvel films). It tries to be emotional, but it's very predictable and it failed to do that for me. 3/10 very overrated.",
        "I buy the films I enjoyed, Ragnarok and quite a few of the other May Among others . This one was more of a phone in, yeah it tied up the series, but it really felt like we have to do this to get it done. I can't argue the storyline needed to go the way it did but some of the characters who were immensely powerful , seemed lessened against Thanos .\n\nThere was very little humour or byplay in it\n\nI look forward to the inevitable internet remake that cuts the last two movies in to one.",
        "Way to long of a movie probably could of cut an hour out of it and it wouldn't have made a difference. Probably one of the worst Avenger movies I've seen. Very slow to get to the point and it do not hold my interest or my husband's.",
        "Has a lot of plotholes, but I still enjoyed it. However, the rating should be lowered to atleast 7 so im giving it 1 to balance it out, as all things should be.",
        "It is getting very boring now. not realistic at all",
        "This movie was awesome. It showed how much we need people who can inspire us and how to win battles. Congrats to all the people involved in the project and RIP Chadwick Boseman. I am shocked to hear that he is dead. I wish his family to be strong.",
        "Are those people who rated this higher than a four suffering from cognitive dissonance? It seems you all allowed the hype to inect your thinking and judgement. This is in my opinion the worse film in the Marvel universe series followed by civil war. To many characters a (story) so so lazy that wasonly written to try and tie the strands of the universe together. The film is at least 1 whole hour to long and is frankly boring. Disney are in danger of destroying this franchise like they have ruined the star wars saga. Why have they ruined the hulk who is now a cuddly bubbling idiot with everything that made him one of the most loved characters stripped from him. Even the set pieces are so so nothing different nothing original. People on here need to start telling the truth because a rating averaging 8.6 is simply a lie. Go watch it and review it without society's cognitive dissonance about this film running through your brains. 4/10 the worse in the series.",
        "After all the hype and build up for this I was expecting a little more than a romantic end to the MCU's most beloved franchise. Plot holes, character development and all around story really made the experience less than memorable. In the people that loved it or disliked it that I've talked to I feel like a 50/50 split is what I'm hearing although after enjoying the previous marvel films. I do not know if the people who rated it so high just feel an obligation to themselves to say they loved it so in their heart they weren't let down or that they did truly enjoy this giant mess of a movie. Take the popularity out of the franchise I think if this was released at the beginning of the MCU the rest wouldn't have done as well. That's my 2 cents.",
        "They shy away from the true aftermath expected from half the universe dying. Only Thor's regret was believable. The entire time heist plot was bull and boring to watch. The battle was hugely overcrowded nothing caught my eye like wow look at that. They should not have had the whole Dr Strange bull that there was only one way. There were many ways it could have been avoided. Felt nothing.",
        "This is the best worst marvel movie i ever seen so much lag",
        "The only reason I have this terrible movie a 1, is because I can't give it a zero. I don't know what I was thinking watching this, but it was awful, just a waste.",
        "This movie was a huge disappointment after the last one. Way too long, no character development, and a foregone conclusion. I'd say skip it but if you're an avengers fan, you have to see the ending. In that case, wait for video and don't expect much and you'll be fine.",
        "Boring, and too campy. But, hey it's what Marvel movies are!",
        "Two hours of boring talk, 45 minutes of action. Overblown and self indulgent.",
        "The film was ok, but i don't see Marvel in it. I see frustrations, unanswered questions, heroes \"unavailable\" and heroes \"unused\". I enjoyed it, but i went in with too many expectations. And in the end i can only say: \"Plot holes ftw\"",
        "Failure with no purpose , and the rating is all about fans",
        "Story not good .. that's way i don't like this type of move.",
        "Nothing to tell,It's an Worst movie of all time in the entire Hollywood film industry.",
        "A CGI mess...Ao many plot holes,terrible jokes and overall stupid movie made for its 12 year old audience",
        "First of all story writing is lazy and the time travel is f**cked up (No understanding of time lines and the effects) and is sickening \ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude13 and dreadful. Wanted to say but I ain't gat time to waste on this pathetic movie.",
        "Just saw Avengers Endgame and I feel disappointed. I loved Infinity War and seeing this makes me want to just end the story with Thanos winning in the last film. The humor was entertaining but severely misplaced. Many characters did not feel like themselves and even with all the references to past marvel films I feel cheated. I don't want to spoil anything for you guys so i'm just gonna leave it there.",
        "If one Avengers production budget funded indie movies, we'd have hundreds of thousands of engaging, good indie films. Please stop making these films now. Just stop. We have the video game somewhere I'm sure, no need to keep on calling them movies. The problem with mass cinema goers is that they actually think this type of film is good. All candy and no cake. I can't watch another one.",
        "The first 30 minutes were almost all talk, so boring. They finally got to some action and humor but with too many characters to keep track of and an over the top storyline in ridiculousness, it was still just not that engaging, not to mention way too damn long. The first Avengers movie rocked. Every one since has been a disappointment unfortunately. Marvel and Disney need to recognize less is more still applies as a storytelling principle of great value.",
        "I felt it the same theme as old movies, May be it is because I am not a hardcore fan of Avengers. Just can watch for time pass.",
        "I am bit confused and I wonder if I am.the only one.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I appreciate hard work put by the team but it seems that praise it is getting from all corners is more than what it actually deserves, It is a fiction and imagination is the limit but hey there is a point where you say to yourself it is getting to point of being silly.\n\nI expected much more.",
        "Not sure about the rave reviews. But was a huge let down. It felt as if they just wanted to end the series . Infinity war could have been a better ending. Lot of flaws on time travel theory as well.",
        "I was not impressed. Save your money and time. Wait till they show this in Netflix John Wick 3 should have been in this film and story line could have been way better!",
        "They absolutely picked THE wrong actor to portray Captain America!He is so anti-America&I know he's acting,but he's never gonna win an award for acting either. Glad he's gone.",
        "Sorry but this film was to long and boring for well over half of the film",
        "Infinity wars felt much more balanced, and Thanos a much better villain. This one is very long, too epic for belief, the emotions less believable, and most of all, the storyline got too messy. Unfortunate as I loved Infinity wars and was looking for a great ending.",
        "How come so many people love this movie ? It was extremely boring, it was difficult to stay awake for three hours",
        "Love the series, but thi movie was just annoying. The characters reaction to urgency had us fast forwarding a lot. :(",
        "Avengers: Infinity War was a pretty mediocre film, all things considered. It suffered heavily from overload (too many characters and plot-lines) but Avengers: Endgame ties things up really well. So well, in fact, that I've watched the film three times now and I'd be up for watching it again sometime in the future.\n\nYou've got humor, strong emotional pieces, a much-appreciated smaller cast of characters and an absolutely fantastic final act.\n\nAvengers: Endgame is simply the gold-standard for the MCU.",
        "Watching this movie has me seriously thinking of inventing my own time machine. I would either go back and prevent the Russo brothers from making this movie or at the very least go back in time and not buy tickets to this movie. All my hopes that had been built up for a year were shattered. Dropped. Smashed. Shattered.",
        "Predictable Boring Nothing Thnos \ud83d\ude39 How stupid \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48",
        "This film has practically no story.\n\nIt is just Marvel throwing everything at us hoping to justify its budget with drawing all sorts of fanboys and of course they succeeded. The part where Thor drinks earth beer and belches is so stupid.\n\nFin.",
        "I was really hoping to watch a good movie. I have seen all Marvel movies and was excited with the 10 star reviews. But this movie is basically garbage. A lot of characters doing random things. There was no interesting story line. The emotional scenes did not have any impact. The action scenes will leave you with a headache. What amazes me is people giving a 10 star, please be honest to yourself and rate correctly.",
        "I WAIT 364 DAYS FOR THIS..... I GIVE THIS MOVIE 4.8./5. THIS IS NICE.",
        "This film is a great finale to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it wraps up all of their prior threads. There are references to years and years of films but it all feels like it comes together very naturally. The use of time travel was pretty well handled and didn't get as messy as in other films. The story itself and the twists were very engaging. One of my main concerns is Captain Marvel, who is so powerful that the writers have to contrive excuses for her to be elsewhere. Otherwise she could just solve most of the problems at once.",
        "Some scenes could have been cut out and the humor was a bit over the top for me in what should've been a more serious and dark film given the stakes. But everything else was knocked out of the park. Emotionally and action-wise with our favorite heroes, THIS is what the fans have been waiting for going on 11 years. I left the theater twice satisfied.",
        "If you expect to watch a movie that is almost as good as Infinity Game then you will be very disappointed... A film that should be at most 90 minutes length it has been pushed at 180 minutes and they felt that time with lot of non-sense talking without action\n\nDidn't worth the money spent to watch the movie, not even the time.. Even if I was offered to watch it again for free, I would pass the offer without any hesitation..",
        "Never seen such a pathetic movie, they didn't meet my expect ions, it has no comparison with Infinity War. The whole plot lack to build a sequence.",
        "I just sleeping in the movie theather, because, okay this is a \"Endgame\", but this movie doesn't have action and i didn't know why this movie don't a sink me.",
        "It could have been better, the first part had a more complex screenplay.",
        "There's There will be blood and more recently Leave No Trace. And then there's this crap. Acting that makes my eyes hurt and a story so bad I just want to stop watching (which I did). It's movies like this that makes me lose faith in the art of film making. And the rating 8.7 just makes me wanna stop talking to people. What a waste of money...",
        "A fitting end to a 22 movie story. It is not a full blown action packed Avengers movie, but what it does, and it does it very well, is wrap up everything in close to 3 hours with respect to everything that's gone before it. No spoilers here, but you'll enjoy the action, laugh at the humour and it will (probably) make you sad in parts. Loved the last couple of scenes especially. It's unusual to be able to watch 2 excellent films in 1 week (Joker being the other).",
        "Disney does nothing but ruin franchises they ruined Star Wars and guardians of the galaxy and now they ruined the Avengers. Infinity wars was bad, but end game is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Make Thor a drunk the hulk is not only weak but a wimp. And Captain Marvel is just the end all be all. I'm done with Disney permanently I would give end game zero stars if I could.",
        "This Is Not A Movie,Not Cinema, This Is A Theme Park",
        "Good movie but not great as many fans and critics claim it to be.",
        "My expectations are not above the infinity war, but movie was sucks in many ways, first storytelling was complex, if rat didn't enter microbus, movie wouldn't exist, directors ruined thor(fathor), also we didn't see hulk and black widow's fighting scene, strange played water, thanos became classic villain after infinity war, he was extremely nerfed too, there was only two emotional scenes, last fight was garbage, it's like directors told all performers '' let's join the fight scene concurrently '' fight scene was same with Aquaman movie, only war in Aquaman happened in water",
        "The movie is not even worth half the rating it has got! It should be 3 or 4",
        "Well, it finally happened: I got emotional during a Marvel movie. Sorry, not sorry. This film truly was a fitting conclusion to a decade of MCU films. While it was a classic action sequel, it was also filled with surprises, homages, laughs, and emotional moments. Unfortunately, that's a LOT to accomplish in one movie (hence the 3 hour runtime). Fortunately, almost all of it worked. They wanted to bring 22 movies to an epic climax...mission accomplished. I'm not sure that I would put this one alongside the best stand alone MCU chapters (Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Ragnarok, Iron Man, etc.), but it somehow pulled all those movies together in a pretty magical way. I complain a lot about the comic book-ification of film, but I can also recognize the accomplishment that is the MCU.",
        "There are numerous plot holes, and honestly, it has been overhyped. Is it worth the watch? Yes, once. But the childish humor and ridiculous plot do not make this a 10/10 or anywhere close.",
        "When the focus is on a few characters, this film shines but the overall focus is blurry-literally and metaphorically. I'm not kidding. Imagine one of your favorite Marvel characters having an awesome fight with some adversaries and the gigantic IMAX image on screen is cropped so that you see only the hero's head, shoulders, belt buckle and arms only up to the wrists because the baddie he or she is fighting is completely out of the frame. When you see the credits and see the leagues and leagues of artists who worked on this thing that were sacrificed on the pyre where they burned the steadicam or the glidecam and an editor that needs to cut from one place to another every two seconds and needed a strong sedative, you will long for a Spielberg, a Ridley Scott, a John Ford or a Hitchcock who knew how to frame things and didn't let the camera and editors run wild.",
        "Infinity War by far the best Marvel by a long way. However Endgame half the film was boring and only the last 10 minutes had an resembles to Infinity war.\n\nThick Thor, Professor Hulk brilliant the rest average.",

        "Love adventure, superheroes and Marvel, but this movie was awful and completely booring. This should have been made into a 15 minute ending of the previous movie. Don't understand who this appeals to. We were a mixed gender group and all of us just waited for it to finally end. Don't except anything exciting or interesting. The plot is easy to see through and they fail miserably to create any emotional connection with the audience.",
        "It was underwhelming. I guess I had expectations for it, some people hyped it up too much. Infinity was better.",
        "I found this movie confusing and fragmented ...all over the place. It appears that Thanos, even without the infinity stones can kick ALL the Avengers butts. What???",
        "First off, phenomenal cast. I can't think of another movie that had even half the headlining talent that this one did. Still, it just plain sucked. Terrible dialogue, boring and repetitive special effects, and longer than Gone with the Wind.\n\nAlso, I detest Gweneth Paltrow. I'd have given a 2nd star if they'd killed her, but they didn't so I didn't.",
        "Horrible, terrible, stupid. All the bad names you could call a movie should be directed at this one.\n\nIt's a pathetic excuse of a movie. It was cool having Guardians of the Galaxy in it, but even their humor and coolness was muted quite substantially.\n\nWhy am I still even writing about this...",
        "Mumbo jumbo happy ending jumping around horse crap. I could vomit from it. Even the music is crap. The only thing good in this movie is Thannos' voice. Also there was 2 good jokes. Well done. How much was this? ooo yeah.. a lot. I pity the people who loves this. It was horrible.",
        "...and pull the hype train over. Amazing fun, stunning spectacle great performances especially RDJ. It's just not the whole sum of its parts. Lots of great parts but not cohesively held. Too much Comedy with one character essentially now just full comedy relief. The most ridiculous coincidences and a couple of plot holes. You will laugh, you will get gut punched and for some you will cry, but then you will wonder what really happened in that 3 hours. Did it need 3 hours? No. Is it better than infinity war?

The first 2 hours are build up that is ultimately paid off but I felt the middle dragged on I just wanted to get to the end. Infinity war kept me interested the whole time, more than endgame. It's definitely worth the whatch and after you don't have to worry about spoilers.8/10.",

The idiocy of the script made me realise the viewers that like this drivel like nothing more than cult like worship of actors names, fictional characters and nothing else. Last one was good but this one was lamer than the new Hulk. Absolutely nothing to gain from watching this Disney reprise to a soy latte drinking generation. GOTG 1 or 2 was at least funny but this was just plain dull scenes welded together like a very expensive TV series. Petty in every way except the budget.",
        "All those who give good rating for this movie are school children and paid reviewers. The whole story are insensible, predictable and too shallow. At the beginning, they (remaining of avengers) easily chop thanos hand and behead him afterward. But at the final battle, they are too soft and then beaten by the purple guy. And then came a red girl (wanda) who almost kill thanos easily. To make it worst, how could cap. Marvel make it too difficult to hold thanos' fingers with both her hands? This doesnt make sense. Some other incident also plague the movie, such as, there would be two zamora after hulk use the stones; where is captain marvel in the story? The writer seems to be unconfident and has no idea how to fit her in the story; dr. Strange come only to play with water; they want to end iron man career coz r.

        "Overlong and cheesy in the extreme. As a massive Avengers fan I was disappointed in the film. Who on earth decided to portray Thor as an overweight bloated drunkard?..That person should be hit with Thor's hammer. In a way I am glad that it has come to an end. It had become a money making machine at the expense of high octane adventure. Yes I will miss it but maybe not as much as I should!!!",

The very premise, that Thanos thinks getting rid of half of the living things in the universe (not half the human or half the sentient beings, but half the cows & half the chickens & half the space creatures too) is just to dumb to handle. A five-year-old could tell you that's a stupid plan, and yet we're supposed to believe a Titan can't see the flaw in it? (I'd say the single bright spot here is Steve Rogers's backside. Truly, America's ass.)",

        "I like the way all the plots come together to please the Marvel nerds, but geez it's boring. It reminded me of star wars 2 (or was it 3?) just loads and loads of abysmal cgi. Smashing, punch, zapping. Lots of creatures, lots of people running around. I watched it over 3 nights, it was that shallow. Unlike some films you can't stop, this made me doze of. They must've spent the budget on the cast and left none for story or cgi. Some of the characters were so forgetful I don't even know who they are. Who's the guy that looks like jesus? who's the lady that has red glowing hands? I would look on imdb, but the cast is so big I can't be bothered.",
        "I have watched the movie when it was just released. A couple of months later and I was looking at the reviews. I cannot believe all the 10/10 scores for this movie.\n\nPersonally I was extremely disappointed with this final movie. Infinity war was an amazing good movie, end game delivers a very simple story based on the time machine concept with plenty of flaws. While I understand the hype and the popularity of the MCU the movie was not bringing me what I was hoping for. There is no further clarification of what led to this movie. The new hulk is another example what I believe was too far fetched. But I don't think I should continue. Surely it is a must see, but for me remains Endgame one of the less convincing movie of this long series of movies brought to us in the las ten years.",

Then an idiotic and predictable battle and i cheered when i could finally get up and leave. I need to find that glove so i can get 3 hours of my life back. Waste of time.",

No sense to talk about, the respect of the comic source.... but Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others involved on their comic origin of the characters has to be suffering in hell seeing how their creations were terribly undermined....... but just analizing from a cinematographic point of view, this film has a terrible argument, script, direction and very poor characters.... 2 hours of the film were not needed, and all the structure that were builded for this collapsed with this ending.

Even my all-time favorite Avenger Spider-Man was there. Nothing that struck me can be faulted by this performance of a movie. The plot is very successful because they couldn't do anything wrong. End enemy is also an acquaintance. As the Box Office numbers suggest, anyone interested has seen this movie. That was a lot of money because many saw it!

And it does something bad: The fat suit for Thor looked soooo fake.\n\nAnd I personally thought what they did with the Hulk was hilarious.\n\nBut I'm honestly sick of Marvel at this point. I'm sick of superheroes and supervillains and the whole interrupting the plot to make a joke thing. And I can only see myself watching this again if someone else wants to watch it.

The story could have been good but WORST follow through I have ever seen. They completely destroy The Avengers from what you have seen so far. The story is slow and seems like they didnt care at all how it ended. The fight scene is rushed and you get to see each person take one swing then they are out. Infinity Wars set up an amazing open end and Endgame ruins 10 years of Marvel films. I am no longer a fan of Marvel. Thanks for the decade long build up to this. And its the last Avengers film, at least with the ones that we know, so they can never fix it. So if youre looking for what you have come to expect from Marvel movie... Look somewhere else.",

If you didn't enjoy it...I am sorry for you.)\n\nI will never be so hyped again for a movie in general. This is the perfect conclusion for a 10 years old saga. It closes the arches of the main characters and opens some for the new ones. The battle scenes are awesome, the themes too, perfect character narration and development. Maybe the plot is a little bit simple and predictable, but sometimes you don't need a complex one to do a perfect movie. You can't judge a movie only by one aspect of itself. Infinity war was the ACTION part, endgame was the FEELINGS part. Yes, infinity war was better, but this movie also has its moments.\n\nOne of the best experiences I had in a theater, we cried, we laughed, we smiled. almost PERFECTION.",

I'm sad because it's the end of this Marvel era and this wasn't the final I was expecting.",

But I will say the pacing was very bad.... very very slow at the start to the point I was nodding off in the theatre .... the movie before had great pacing of action, drama and comedy...... Endgames first half was just boring. Also balance of heroes in the first movie was done much better than this movie which really should have been called Captain America & Iron Man + Avengers. And time travel as a plot device is a very lazy way of solving issues ... I cringed when that came up ........ Thanos and his lieutenants were a threat in Infinity War... in this movie they felt really dumbed down.",

The scenes that were meant to be emotional were executed poorly, didnt make me feel anything other than boredom. Seems all the 10 star ratings are just from marvel fans! Face it guys, it is a bad film. The previous avengers was 1000x better. The whole length of infinity war was about them defeating thanos, in this film it took them 20 minutes.",
        "It's long, and I don't mean in time length, but plot. It FEELS loooooong. The LOTR trilogy flew by. This...did not. And I'd love to know why Cpt. Marvel was in there at all. The climax is amazing. It is truly the climax of climaxes, but that's not surprising. Any superhero movie with its salt, is going to have a badass battle against good and evil.",

So instead of another decently awesome Marvel movie they went polar opposite to Infinity War and decided to make the worst movie possible. They chose to destroy the foundation of each of the main Avenger characters and prop up the secondary characters as the heroes in order to share the screen or be politically correct or something silly like that. And can we please stop making movies about time travel. It's stupid and impossible to do correctly and impossible in general so just ditch the idea! There's a lot more I could say but it's been almost a year now and I just don't care enough to keep tearing this movie apart. Basically I'm done watch Marvel because of this movie.",

First of all it was way too long, they could have written this story in half of the time. Three hours is already long for an interesting movie, so you can imagine how painful it gets when it's not that interesting. If I have to be honest I fell asleep a couple of times towards the end, that's how captivating this story was. Maybe one day I will watch it again to see if I missed anything but I have my doubts that I will do that. Not all actors are great actors, but that we already knew from this cast. This kind of movies has to have it from the action scenes and special effects, which this movie just lacked. I think this time we can call it a day and move on to something else. Bye bye avengers!",

Thor is, as always, well played and funny. Hulk is pretty decent and that's about it. Story is not interesting at all. Too many pointless dialogues that go on and on with no message whatsoever. The main idea behind the movie seems to be to let the guys do something, pack as many faces on screen as we can and, as long as there are explosions and some colorful CGI, it will be fine. There is no depth, no cohesion to the story. I stopped watching it at 2h 15 min trying to save 45 minutes of my life.",
        "After watching endgame I felt nothing special,it was completely predictable and disapointing ending, just like every superhero movie the bad guy loses and the good guys win, garbage, it was a long boring movie with the only special thing to show for it is the 45 minute long mess of horrible cgi they call a \"final battle\"",
        "A big disappointment for Thor fans. Intentionally made him dummy and useless. No other Avenger has such a great screen presence than Thor and this was intentionally ruined in the movie. Was expecting till the end for Thor to come back in this movie. It was totally stupid to make Thor like this.",
        "The 22-movie Infinity Saga of the MCU comes to a close in its best film yet. Avengers: Endgame is everything we wanted and more. It's hilarious, it's action-packed, and has one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a superhero film, let alone any movie. It's full of fan service and nods to the previous films. I don't really have any issues with the film, at least those that are not spoilers anyway. If I had one non-spoiler issue with the film it would be fact that the first hour is a bit slow but afterwards it picks up and never stops. Really any complaints I have with this film is shut out by everything else. My complaints are just nitpicks. It fits its three hour runtime very well and provides a highly satisfying end to the 11 year saga that began with Iron Man in 2008. The MCU has set a new direction and I can't wait to see what happens next.",
        "Dont get me wrong, i know 99% of the reviews are from marvel/avengers fans but hey im not blame you all youre are blind and marketing from producers swept you down. Let me see - opening was perfect but suddenly half of the movie is boring, cheaply dark, second part of the movie is too chaotic. Movie trashes other truly legendary films about their non logical sory but here is seemingly everything logical ? LOL ... I could name like 6 very stupid/ilogical/boring things but hey, whats the point. Im just glad all the avengers nonsense ended. I liked Infinity War for its adult-ish story, dark/serious tone, nice and attractive story but here producers knew that EVERYTHING goes and NOTHING will be criticised from die hard fans.. Even if the movie was bad in 50% of the avengers fan, still everybody from you would love it.. Producers have the luck that this franchise is very very solid in terms of acceptance.. For neutral fan like me ? theres HUGE gap between Infinity War and Endgame.",
        "This movie in my opinion was considerably worse than Infinity War, too many inconsistencies and boring scenes which did not contribute much to the characters or the progression of the story. Much of the first 30-40 minutes of the film felt like filler put into the film in order to highlight the actors/actresses ability to act without many other implications to the story.\n\nHulk and Thor do steal the show completely without a doubt however. Lastly, if the aggregious product placement was not completely off putting to you, then there is not much to say.",
        "Overrated, 2 boring hours and 1 hour fighting. A movie that depends on the effects only",
        "So dissappointed. Was expecting a blast of a film. Cutting film time down by half hour/hour might have made it better. Only the last hour was ok, but expected much more with that also. Storyline not great either. Previous Avengers films much better. Such a shame. Waste of money really. Expectation I guess has earned its box office takings.",
        "This best film to watch having high rating and box office being the highest grossing film. I watched it hall it was so nice.",
        "I'm glad I didn't pay to see this one... Infinity war was way better...",
        "Honestly: at the 2 hour mark i was checking my watch to try and figure out how much more I had to put up with before it made sense. The storyline was sporadic, and bounced around so much that it just got confusing and boring. I have no intent, nor interest, to watch it again",
        "Left the cinema disappointed!\n\nNot a patch on infinity war - in fact I would of preferred finishing the franchise with infinity wars ending! Ragnorak had natural humour - they tried forcing humour into this and it went down like a lead balloon!\n\nPredictable drivel focussing on boring characters - how are people giving this over a 5? Made a mockery of the 21 films before it - hulk and Thor's character????? Ridiculous!\n\nAvengers infinity war 9/10 End game 2/10\n\nZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz",
        "Another fun movie to watch 4/10 for sure (imdb makes us compare this movie to godfather) I just don't see any difference between this nice popcorn movie and others like ninja turtles, transformers and GI joe! fun to watch but plz don't give it an oscar!!!!",
        "Let me start I'm a big fan of marvel so there is no biased against them. This movie is a big pile of trash. Don't give them your hard earn cash like I did, wish I could take back 3 hours of my life. Director thinks we watch superheroes movies looking for oscar winning performances. 2hours of nonsense time travel talk, about 15min action and than more nonsense pushing agenda #metoomovement?. I thought about walking out several times.\n\nRubbish.",
        "I slept during movie first time in my entire life.I can bare any kind of movie in my life but this was litery garbage movie. My humble request is to stay at home give time to ur family dont waste money on this movie.",
        "Endgame is such a bad conclusion for the epic Avengers saga. Everything sounds predictable and even boring, as the firsr 2 hours of movie is a non-sense fanservice for HQ readers. All the hype the movie had relied only on Marvel franchise, because the movie, at best, is mediocre, even compared to the previous one. There are a few cringeworthy momments to take note: \"professor\" Hulk 4th wallish jokes, the time travel machine itself, fat drunk Thunder God Thor and the worst one: \"She's not alone\" empowered heroines against the purple male patriarch. Unless you are a fanboy or fangirl, watching this will be 3 hours less in your lifespam.",
        "Endgame is one of those movies that uses the hype and nostalgia of the old ones to give off an illusion that it's good when in reality its unoriginal CGI filled poorly written garbage",
        "Not and Avengers fan here but Infinity war was surprisingly good. Very good even thanks to the complexity of Thanos.\n\nThey just messed it up in Endgame. Gone the complexity of Thanos. Captain Marvel\"s intervention is just lazy writing.\n\nToo long. Boring.\n\nAnd Falcon??? Seriously???",
        "Endgame was hands down the worst entry in the Marvel cinematic universe. I've had random bouts of depression ever since i saw this film. It ruined so many of the films that preceded it i have no words. Zero stars if i could.",
        "You really think this movie is one of the greatest movies all-time? Better than Forrest Gump, Inception, and The Matrix? You must be joking!!",
        "This movie should not exist. Please remake it. Infinity war was much better. I was kind of suspicious when they started promoting it so much.\n\nWe need better ending to all these years of loyalty. So many things in this movie are unreasonable. Why why why",
        "Avengers INFINITY WAR was the best in the series so my expectations were low for the follow up. This movie dealt more with substance than style and is completely different than all the other Avenger movies. Definitely the most emotional movie of the series hence why they called it Endgame. Yes it's long but the characters carry the film much more than the action does. I enjoyed the film and may watch it again sometime. It was very good and delivered a fitting end but not the type of Avenger film you would want to watch again and again. That film belongs to INFINITY WAR.",
        "How can Marvel, the Russo brothers as well as the scriptwriters go from delivering the best superhero movie ever made, Avengers Infinity War, to offering such trite tosh as Endgame? I was so disappointed that I almost threw up. I suspect at the end of the day they ran out of ideas and thought its gonna be a great way to fool us fans by offering us the final movie to make an extra billion by putting together what seemed like the worst outtakes of a b unit.!",
        "A bunch of overly made up guys and a couple of plastic looking females all decked in 80s leather outfits fight over a bedazzled fashion accessory.",

        "Unicorns and rambows, girlpower and pointlessness, they tried to hatch astory together but the main villian which they tried to kill in prevous movie was now left to rot on some plannet and gets killed in seconds.",
        "It was hard going, same old Marvel machine churning out predictable plot. Would rather of re-watched Game of Thrones S8E3 again that of wasted my time and money on this.",
        "You wont miss anything entertaining. I didnt know what to expect from this final film, but I certainly wasnt expecting to watch arguably the slowest moving Marvel movie ever made. Does it make up for it in that one epic fight scene? not really. So many other movies have done epic battles far better than this. Now I cant sleep properly cuz I got so much rest during Endgame!",
        "I really wanted this to be the best ending ever but I was so disappointed. The other Avenger movies were very enjoyable but this one was different. Like Dr Strange said there are so many ways this could have ended. Unfortunately, in order to close the many arcs the story just felt forced, poorly paced with many many liberties taken that should not have been like the \"storm trooper wielding a light saber moment\" with Captain America. They also manage to get every woman in the film in the frame at the same time looking real tough. Do we really expect that 3.5 seconds of supposed girl power to inspire anyone? Give me a break! It's very condescending IMO. Also I felt like other characters were not properly utilized. Technically the film looked really good and the acting was great. I'll watch it at home once and probably never again. It will still make tons of cash and a lot of people seem to be satisfied.",
        "They ruined hulk very badly, because even Ironman was fighting with hulk in the movie but not the hulk",
        "Most excellent movie-verse ending with excellent war sequence at the climax. The war scenes are excellently directed and visualised. And also how the time travel has been handled is very good though not comparing with others. Everyone has their own time travel theories, we shouldn't judge. It is a movie which ends an era of MCU-phase-2.",
        "No no I'm not crying, am I? MCU till here has invaded our hearts, it's been emotional, laughter, the love that is shown in irreplaceable.",
        "A tremendous production, with lame script, very obvious and almost boring time line, I hardly kept my eyes open to watch it to the end. The movie was also too long for the poor content. They could have told that sorry in 1,5 hours. Oh my God... and Thor... seriously? Is it a joke? And captain America holding his hammer... that finally destroyed the image of the great Thor. Pity!",
        "Very poor movie filled with plot holes. May be they wanted to release the movie soon and hence decided, lets have a grand CGI fight, some humor, use complicated words and hype it so much that people will say it was good (May be pay the critics?) It goes in the list of bad comic book movies. If your only exposure to comics is through Marvel movies, may be you will like it. I think most people will watch it just to see how they attain closure to the fantastic movie timeline, time and money spent is not going to worth it though.",
        "Extremely overhyped movie, loved by marvel fanboys only. Its insulting to say that its the best movie ever, if that was the case, human race would have failed and we all should be killed by a meteor.",
        "No spoilers but it was hyped up too much, and a lot of things just felt off in this movie the jokes and circumstances. It's gonna be one of those films where you're gonna love or just feel eh",
        "They should have called it Captain America: end game Every scene is oriented to that useless character",
        "One of the dullest films I've seen in a long time. The initial three quarters of the film is taken up with sentimental and tedious character development twaddle including flashbacks. It ends with 30mins of seen it all before low rent CGI action. That this can have a rating of over 8 is a testament to the serious dumbing down of our popular culture.",
        "Infinity War would have been a more fitting end to the series. Endgame feels like it jumped the shark and stole all your money doing it. While the actors are perfect for their roles as you would expect the script and story and directors are out of their mind and can't agree on how anything works. This could have been trimmed to 2 hours with little lost. I would have been less disappointed had I seen Batman V Superman by mistake.",
        "I dont know why but this move very dull for me.\n\nMany gaps. So much potential but they dont use it\n\nIm really MCU fans but this just soo far below my expectation.\n\n4 stars for the saga not the movie",
        "A disjointed CGI mess. Too much going on to feel like a real narrative was going on. Very few laughs, didn't feel like it had much of a soul. Thought infinity war was a much more complete marvel movie.",
        "Endgame is a fan based movie, only MCU fans gonna like it. This movie is the greatest superhero fantasy movie, a perfect ending for generation. There is lots of goosebumps moments, lots of oh my God moments, wtf moments. Especially the last 30 minutes you will see the greatest Cinematic war,some upsets for fans. Avengers endgame will be remembered as one of the greatest movie.",
        "The story was terrible. The dialogue was terrible. Character development was forced. The end battle was impossible to keep up with. This movie does NOT live up to the hype.",
        "Very bad movie just waste of time and money. in the first two hours of the movie nothing happen.",
        "I just didn't enjoy this as much as infinity war but not a huge marvel fan. Not sure why this is getting so much hype.",
        "I can't describe my disappointment. The movie was very boring with predictable happy end.",
        "In trying too hard Marvel have actually ruined what could have been a perfect end to their storyline and a wonderful start to prequels for certain characters. This movie was soo long unnecessarily that it has put me off from watching another Marvel movie again with the exception of Black Panther and Spider-Man.",
        "Greatest movie of all time. Period. The plot, the execution, everything?",

        "A movie I feel like I've been waiting an eternity only for it to be a mild disappointment. I'm a huge fan of Marvel comics and have followed the movies with anticipation without any real misses. This was suppose to be the ultimate climax and while there were some nice twists it was in danger of unraveling, but they did just manage to hold it together. The final scenes are very good and ties up the story nicely, but it doesn't excuse the previous 3 hours of ass-numbing tedium",
        "My First movie review ever and thats because I love Marvel absolutely love it to core and the expectations I had from this movie were just way too much, and after watching I am so disappointed. Infinity wars was just so much better, End Game has way too many plot holes and some very lazy writing. I wish I liked it after such a long wait but unfortunately I just couldnt",
        "So boring and they ruined so much character I was really disappointed and let down if your a fan of Thor or hulk don't watch",
        "It was ok. Kinda dragged, felt a little hamfisted at times, was extremely deliberate, and the \"solution\" felt contrived and far too easily stumbled upon. I know people are going to give this movie great reviews because they're huge marvel fans or whatever, but looked at objectively, it's just kinda ok.",
        "More than 2 hours of drama and only minutes of action...or at least that's what it felt like. Also, tons of that annoying Hollywood epic type of music to make me consider muting it.",
        "Try as did to like Endgame , the pace was poor, script nonsensical and apart from a few laughs, won't be going to watch it again like Infinity War. At times it was embarrassing to sit through it. Especially the ending. One to forget.",
        "Boreing boreing boreing theyn should have finished the movie in part 1 infinity war......DO NOT WATCH.",
        "I can't even find the words to describe how dissappointed I am... All these years, all these movies, and all this build up of excitement - all for nothing.. I'll just watch \"Infinity War\" over and over again, until I forget they ruined it all like this..",
        "Yeah I was highly disappointed in this movie. It didnt deliver on anything I hoped for. I wanted to like it too. I dont even like to talk bad on these movies because we are lucky enough just to get these characters on the big screen, but this was easily my least favorite marvel cinematic universe movie. I hate to say it but my top 5 least favorite comic movies are probably now... 1. Batman and Robin 2. Batman v Superman 3. Justice league 4. Green lantern 5. Avengers endgame 6. (Incase you were wondering) Thor: darkworld",
        "Don't know what all the hype was about! The film is one hour too long because there just wasn't enough action. The Hulk was not so \"Incredible\" & Thor was not much of a \"God\" I was rather perplexed by how underutilised some of the characters were given the powers they have. The ending had potential, but unfortunately it failed to deliver. It's good but not great.",
        "No words except claps, cheers and cries. This movie is the greatest movie of 2019. A truly satisfying conclusion to the MCU. The Russo brothers have proven once again how good of filmmakers they are.",
        "But I want to try to bring the rating down because it does not deserve to be ranked among such movies as The Godfather and Twelve Angry Men.\n\nIll start by saying the movie starts off really strong. Whenever you're dealing with time travel, there's it almost always going to end up messy. There's about a 45 minute stretch in here where the film isn't really coherent, and the way they choose to cover that is by distracting us with a humor, literally a joke every 10 seconds. After a certain point, the movie gets a lot better during the second half.\n\nNot as good or as tightly written as infinity war. I think everyone is raving over this movie because it's the end of the marvel franchise, and they did a good job at wrapping everything up. It is no where near one of the \"best movies of all time\" like everyone is saying.",
        "A bit like a compilation album, some really great tracks but generally just filler. Cinematically it was epic, spectacular, CGI filled superhero awesomeness but the film was slow to start (after a brilliant emotional first 15 mins) and I was mostly underwhelmed by the plot. I felt Thor was ruined by the joke and some parts were just cameos for the sake of it. I did sob with my son at the saddest part, but I still feel a bit... meh.... maybe I need to watch it again to see if it's better second time around!",
        "Marvel fan for years now and I am disappointed about Endgame.\n\nAvengers 2 is much better, full of action with multiple scenes, full cover for each single hero",
        "Not sure what all the fuss is about. It's no way an all-time top ten film",
        "This is WAY better than Infinity War, my opinion though. But Thor-bawski was played for laughs too much.",
        "It was an disappointment! That's all i can say ! Absolute trash",
        "I've never been a super fan of Superhero movies. Having said that have seen most of the marvel films. The one takeaway from Avengers Endgame is that it is an extremely ambitious piece of film making. It's unusual that so many of the actors and artists who many people have come to idolize over the years should come together in a film.\n\nThe film starts five years after Infinity Wars ended. Not going to include any spoilers, but there's a good part of the opening half of the film spent looking into the devastating consequences of Infinity Wars which are very script/character driven. Not surprisingly the second half of the film is very much action based and the 3 hours running time fairly fizzes along. Although it isn't perfect Endgame is definitely one of the best Superhero movies I've watched and lived up to expectations.",
        "THE WORST !!! they turned what should have been the best comic book plot, into a bollywood melodrama, it's just pathetic. don't waste your time watching babies material.",
        "If you ignored the PC-stuff in the last movie, it was still a pretty enjoyable movie. But this? Nothing was coherent, it was too long, and it it wasn't until the very end that it delieved any decent action.",
        "Unoriginal, way too long, more comedy than action, outstanding special effects as usual but the story was so lame. Expected way more out of this. I wish I would have waited to watch on dvd or TBS for free!! Waste of money and time",
        "After the great lead in from \"Avengers - Infinity War\" I expected an equally well written and logical conclusion in this movie. That did not happen. When I saw the ratio of 10's to 1's in the ratings for this movie I had to ask myself \"Did I watch the same movie as the people who gave it a \"10\"? Who are these people that think this movie is the best thing they have ever seen? I could spend many paragraphs laying out the problems with this movie, but you should just read about 10 -15 of the other reviewers who have given this movie a \"1\" rating to see what I am talking about. Same level of disappointment as Game of Thrones final episode.",
        "It was painful to watch this movie as it reached its conclusion. Great movies don't need a happy ending. Infinity War was a perfect example. Endgame, however, left me 10 times sadder. Sad, bored, annoyed and disappointed. No need to state the reasons, as many reviewers before me properly did that.\n\nWhat amazes me though is how the Russos did a fantastic job with movies like The Winter Soldier or Infinity War and came up with this grotesque finale. I cannot conceive any reasonable explanation, other than Disney having a hidden malefic plan to slaughter great franchises (for Star Wars they decided to go with a slow painful process). Whatever it takes, right?",
        "Far too long and uninteresting. No character development. Pacing between large battles and dialogues way off, making both of them equally boring and drawn out.",
        "This was probably one of the worst movie I have seen, even on the Marvel scale. How can they take so many talented actors and make this non-sense? I laughed every time emotional drama came. Instead of tears, I was was feeling pity for myself. I hope this is really the endgame. But I doubt.",
        "WoW.\n\nWe connect with story each plot each minute. The biggest fight sequence.",
        "Loved, LOVED Infinity War... End Game on the other hand was utter trash. I cannot believe the Russo's directed both. I regret not walking out. The thought crossed my mind at least 3 different times.",
        "This was supposed to be the final movie that crowed the franchise and Infinity War set high expectations. I was utterly disappointed. The plot doesn't make sense and throws away a lot of character development, to the point that some of them are just shallow version of what they were in other movies (and could become).\n\nBut what really annoyed me was the sentimentalism that permeated the whole movie. It is like you have to shed a tear for every character and the movie is trying to make you cry in scenes that don't move the plot forward. If in Infinity War they really stroke a good balance between action and emotion, here they just are there for the sake of it.",
        "Movie overall is okej. But for being an 3 hours movie i expected alot more! Slow first hour, messy story telling and they really destroyed couple of characters with jokes and pure boring stuff. It felt like 10 different people wanted to get their story/scen idea in the movie. I have been marvel fan all my life, but this movie was far the most disappointed one i have seen and they really ruined couple of characters for me. You should see it, still okej movie but not more.",
        "A movie with a great closing, but that has many plot holes the truth is not on par with its predecessor Infiniti war, you should not let yourself be carried away by fanaticism is a good movie but leaves much to be desired",
        "This movie was surprisingly boring for the first two hours. Too much talking, tears and drama. The boredom of the drama and the action starts exactly after two hours. I started enjoying this movie only at that point. During the two hours of drama I was constantly thinking whether I should leave, but 12 Euros that I paid made me wait. Being fun of the genre, for me this was not impressible at all. Waste of money and time.",
        "I was super excited to see this movie after Infinity War ended but I left rather disappointed. It was good but I felt like the first hour or so was wasted space. I did love Thor though.",
        "Did you know there are people who don't like this movie? Weird. The culmination of a decade long, 20+ film, multi-director effort to create a cohesive cinematic universe and they pulled it off. Gripping, exciting, heart-breaking... It's an amazing work both on its own and in the scope of this massive undertaking.",
        "One should just stop at Avengers Infinity War and not watch this stupid movie. One of the worst movies of this series.",
        "Very boring.. Not gonna see again, Will however see the first two installments, as they are way better.",
        "Expected more much more as a fan I have continue sly fallowed the franchise wanted a better way of story telling much better story line it felt like every world from different song in a same album glued together in the worst way possible",
        "The people how got these job got overwelmed and starter messing up every single thing, they stetched the movie to nowhere, leading to events that don't make any sense... true fans will feel that this was a kick in the stomach... I'm just disapointed.\n\nSimply a spit on Stan Lee's grave.",
        "3 hours about nothing. Only one reason why this movie has too large box office is hyping.",
        "Way too long, drawn out and long winded. Very little action in it. Very little funny humor. Way too much cringe in it. Especially the \"SJW girl power\" scene towards the end. Massive cheese fest at the end. Couldn't wait for it to end while in the cinema. I enjoyed the last film but this was well below average. These 10/10 reviews are just Marvel fanboys I think.",
        "Endgame is certainly one of its kind. A movie that will be marked as the film of this decade. Building up from Iron Man to Captain Marvel, a 10 journey filled with joy, adventure and tears. And we need a perfect ending to all of that. Endgame is the perfect ending. A movie that has everything a fan will ever dream of, an amazing cast and a wonderful climax. It is such a huge payoff from 10 years worth of building up. To look at this from a Fan's perspective, it is an awesome movie and it is a masterpiece. But to look at this from a critic's perspective, it is not the best movie. It certainly lacks some elements to a perfect movie. But this to me, is such a wonderful movie and I definitely loved it. It has everything I wanted and I'm gonna give this movie a 9/10.",
        "I really prefered the avengers infinity war. This movie was good but sometimes its get very annoying. Some jokes are good. The only point that i like was the end and all the event can cause for the future. I really love what marvel did with the avengers and the whole story behind it. Its very interesting to follow along.",
        "I predicted that the conclusion to GOT will not amount to anything...... and I was absolutely right.\n\nNot so with the MCU. I believed this wouldn't go anywhere the terrible previous Marvel movies haven't been already ...I was dead wrong. Not only was the 3rd phase of the MCU very well thought out and written...I actually endet up watching them several times due to great character dynamics and an engaging overall story line.\n\nI stand corrected. Continue.",
        "Finally got around to watching this film. I wanted to like it... I'll stick with Logan , Deadpool and the gritty old Batman's. It's clear the direction Disney is going to take marvel and it's straight to cartoon land.",
        "They took your typical superhero fare and made it quite interesting. No spoilers, but seriously, who on the planet hasn't seen it yet. All the elements you'd expect were there, but I was more impressed with how they wrapped up the journey for these characters.",
        "The first half felt sappy and chatty. I found myself fighting the Zzzz in this first half. But the second half felt like a time travel thriller (a la mission impossible team). The climax with the actual battle was good, like epic battles we have seen before from the Marvel Universe. I was disappointed that there wasn't an end scene. I have grown accustomed to expect an end scene leading up to a new Marvel movie so I felt jipped watching the ending credits and not seeing an end scene. I think it's like a 6 3/4 out of 10 and I rounded it up to 7/10",
        "This is where everything we've watched comes together and it is a thrilling movie experience. Although still not as good as the original avengers film. It is truly impressive how everything is blended beautifully with a mind flowing finale. Sure the time traveling stuff feels a little unnecessary but it works for the overall story. Its complexity gives all the performers here some inspired moments. I mean it was one hell of an experience being in the theater opening night and watching the audience go insane. This too me feels like the end of these films and although it goes on just a bit too long it ties everything up nicely.\n\nBudget: $356m Box Office: $2.797B\n\n9/10",
        "It blows my mind that this movie is rated so highly for how bad it is. It's OK, but it's rated as the #40 best movie as of now. It's just very boring and has no re-watch value.",
        "I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect \"ending\" of the Avenger Movies. I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!",
        "They seem to have gone more family friendly and the comedy inserts they put in from here to there are just cringe worthy. More drama than action. No thanks",
        "What to say about this film good points its an avengers movie bad points it was not what you would expect from an avengers movie was complete rubbish from start to finish",
        "The biggest blockbuster of the world. Undoubtedly it's the best movie of my life. The ending made worth all 22 movies. You can't take your eyes off the movie for a single moment. It's the highest grossing movie of all time. Acting, direction, carecter development, screenplay, visual effects, BGM, dialogues everything is outstanding, there is nothing new to say about that. And the final battle... It's just marvelous. I don't have words that can explain how much I love the Avengers movie series. This film made me emotional at the same. Some of my favorite characters will never be seen again. No new character can take their place. And finally.... AVENGERS ASSEMBLE.",
        "Part four of this gigantic Avengers saga cannot really be evaluated alone. It is directly related to part three. You can put them together like two pieces of a puzzle. In my opinion, both together are much better than parts 1 and 2.\n\nI'm excited. From the end of Part 3 at the latest, I was completely in the Avengers Universe. The action, the drama. Everything at a very high level, despite the many characters and superheroes. But the special thing about the Avengers is that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are not afraid to break taboos. In part four it is tough and it rarely gets cheesy or boring. Despite the very long three-hour runtime. In addition to all the superhero films, some of which dissolve into insignificance, Avengers looks like a little masterpiece.",
        "This movie isn't perfect. But i feel like Endgame is actually pretty amazing because it has more characters than any other movie and somehow manages to give a conclusive ending to all of them along with 11 years of the Infinity saga.\n\nThe Portals scene means so much to me and billions across the world, a conclusion to everything we love and I'd never have it any other way.",
        "Coulda been done 1m better in an hour or so - too much crap on the hot dog to get a decent bite",
        "Flicking through the ratings I saw a lot of 1/10 and a lot of 10/10. For me, it was like any other avengers movie, it was kinda epic. But still, 10/10 is a bit overrated.\n\nA lot of trends they inject into movies these days aggravate me. You can look at any superhero movie, Marvel or DC, since fortnite was booming it was somehow featured in the movies. The same can be said for political movements or protests/marches (LGBTQ-acceptance, feminism etc.). I don't mind them, but I don't need to be reminded of them by seeing them in every movie I go to watch.\n\nI think that this is the movie for a passionate marvel-fan, but it isn't the end of the world if you don't see it.",
        "Avengers end game was last part of Marvel Cinematic Universe's phrase 3. It was enjoyfull and kinda nostalgic. This movie was full revise of last 12 years of mcu journey. More likely a complete package of action,emotion,comedy and so many things. Totally worthy for watching.",
        "All of these 1 and 2 star reviews, WHAT movie did these people watch?",
        "I am usually a really big fan of anything marvel but seriously what a crappy way to end this saga... Why did the writers need to add in all of the SJW rubbish in the movie? And what's the go with captain marvel? Terrible casting, made me dislike the movie even more... And ruining Thor? He's usually one of the most enjoyable characters to watch. And they turned him into a useless drunk. I really don't understand the high ratings.. Please don't believe the hype.",
        "They must kill Thanos through time travel. The end. Endgame is nothing more than just an okay film but with a very disappointing conclusion. Figure it out yourself. The fake a\u00b7\u00b7 CGI action was nice and the story was not bad but, oh god, do I hate it when they implement feminism into the mix. Yes, the future of the MCU is an emasculating bloody tampon and the bad a\u00b7\u00b7es I am reluctant to accept is a shrieking ugly b\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. God! Anyways, other disappointments is what they did to Thor and Hulk, making them look like basement dwelling soylent sucking dingle berries. Sorry, but I like my action heroes manly and testosterone driven. Not gay. Overall, Endgame wasn't too bad but, really, it's not even close to an 8.5 rating as currently given. So pathetic.",
        "World is broken. 5 years on but still broken. But then is a hope, a small chance. They gather the remaining of the team (broken, depressed ) and go on for the challenge. But now they have a plan, ready to sacrifice and get along with their past differences which they lacked in Infinity War. Story goes total nuts. The time travel, retrieval of stones without actually disturbing the timeline but complicacy happens. The end fight is superb. The fallen are back and universe vs thanos happens. Who wins? You have to see this. Completing the characters arc for many superheroes. IronMan, Vision, BlackWidow, Captain America. End of infinity stones chapter(fingers crossed). How they filmed the meetups during fight was good. Visual effects, sound were brilliant. and the wedding scene! Returing the stones is a bit complicated and why it didnt disturbed the timeline? Rest is goooood.",
        "Inept hallucinating nonsense movie with a delirious and boring plot.",
        "What a waste of fan service. Absolute cringe and quantum plot will blow your mind",
        "A good movie for 12 years old kids! Super heroic movies don't belong in top 250 unless they're Nolan's dark Knight or philipses Joker. Marvel uses politics to win just like all other over-rated movies we're seeing these days. Cheers to the pure old cinema.",
        "In my opinion this is my second favorite movie in the MCU only outdone by Infinity War. The perfect end to one of the most ambitious stories ever constructed. kudos to marvel for this fantastic piece of art. Simply it's a love letter to the fans",
        "Complete feminists movie. Several male hero characters were belittled and turned into abysmal failures. Waste of time and money.",
        "This movie lacked everything that made its predecessor Infinity War so great. The comedic take on Thor was the worst part of the whole 22 movie franchise. The pace of the movie was slow and boring. Overall, this movie is one big disappointment.",
        "And youll have a decent action flick for teenagers. the rest is pathetic and boring. juts forgettable: very foreseeable plot and a finale that borows from an american football superbowl.",
        "My favourite movie of all time. I love every minute of it and I'll be rewatching it many times in my life. The movie brings the franchise back down to some of it's core members to really delve into their unique perspectives on the events of the past film. It gives many of the characters very satisfying endings to their arks, and sets up other characters really well to carry on their legacy.\n\nIf you've not seen a marvel movie before, I highly recommend catching up with the other ones first, but this is a must see for everyone.",
        "Hurts to be a fan and say something like this. Avengers: Endgame is a movie that takes too long to mesh, forcing a situation of drama that does not convince in many parts. Practically 2/3 hours of film with many unnecessary dialogues and misdirected performances. The plot holes and bad decisions of the writers is quite evident, except for those who do not expect much from a movie that should end a fantastic universe era built over eleven years. Even so, it has it's high points in 1/3 - great moments, solid acting, and so much fan service. It's a pity that's not in the same level of Avengers: Infinity War at all, but is an 'Ok movie' and don't deserves 10/10 and 1/1 rates.",
        "Too many plot holes. The first 90 minutes were really slow. The next 90 minutes were too rushed. Infinity war was wayyyyy better.",
        "The whole plot had me in tears! To me, Hemsworth's the funny guy and Cumberbatch's the hot one.",
        "There is more to story than action scenes. The movie was great, not as good as Infinity War but not terrible as people are making out. I understand the critisism but people rating below a 5 are clearly fan based blind.",
        "I was slightly underwhelmed by the movie and I didn't cry at the ending at all. There was far too much sickly sweet scenes for my liking.\n\nThe time travel bit left more questions than answers for me. The 2nd click mmmm\n\nI won't be going to see anymore Marvel movies apart from maybe Black Panther as I'm done",
        "I thought that Endgame will blow me away, I was wrong. Infinity Ward was an amazing movie, it got 10 out off stars and it just a flawless masterpiece with no errors just pure art. Endgame is full off meaningless crap like the awful humor with cheesy one liners that just destroys the entire movie. It's not funny please stop it I thought while the movie just keep going with these lame and embarrassing jokes that just bored and got me mad at the movie to the point that I wanted it to end but it never did. Another bad thing is that Endgame is so predictable that its just a joke, you don't even have to watch the movie to know how it ends. But the movie did entertain me and it really got tearing up scenes that left me emotional and great character ark, acting and action scenes, but the problem is that there isn't enough of these elements to save the movie, and what's left is a big letdown. Good dammit.",
        "The Infinity War movie was better. I watched this movie 3 times in the cinema. I didn't like it very much when I watched it the first time, but I liked it after watching it. The ending of the movie was a bit sad. The battle scene was epic.",
        "Rating 10/10 Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic & perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie.",
        "How did they get this so wrong?\n\nAbsolute travesty, and possibly the most disappointed I've ever been with a movie.\n\nLately disappointment is a recurring theme, with a string of average or outright terrible \"blockbusters\".",
        "I was bored throughout this movie. 1. Nothing really happens for most of the movie and there are so many unnecessary long scenes. 2.There is one really good fight/ action sequence. 3. THEY DID THOR SO WRONG. I watched Infinity war the night before and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. With endgame I was looking at my phone the whole time hoping something would happen.",
        "I have been watching most marvel movies since when iron man 2 came out , seen em all except hulk , but after watching this I finally had a horrible realisation : I have never felt anything while watching them , other than a few cheap laughs and some impressive action they really don't have much to offer .Why did watch them , this one didn't feel like a waste of time but it didn't feel I a use of my time either *sigh* why , what have i been doing",
        "Avengers: End Game is long, boring, and predictable--with an endless amount of fan service. The humor in this movie just doesn't get a laugh. I cannot express how disappointed I am with the conclusion of 10 years of movies. I'm shocked this film is actually getting good reviews. This will be the last Marvel movie I see on opening night. I cannot help but think this is the beginning of the end for the MCU. It was good while it lasted.",
        "Absolutely loved it, every character gets a good chunk of screen time and they all use it to full effect, its laugh out loud funny at times, really touching at times.",
        "Was fortunate enough to watch this title in my late teens after becoming continuously disillusioned with hollywood blockbusters, especially comic book movies. Endgame is a glorious scrap monument of tropes and cliches with little continuity - it is Hollywood personified. While the MCU is an impressive achievement overall, a 2.5 hour long action figure line-up with sparkly, beautiful star actors interacting with glorified CG cartoons doesn't hold much substance beneath the glitz and glitter.\n\nIf you're like me, however, and have grown tired of repetitive tropes, this is a hilarious unintentional comedy.",
        "Fell asleep during the first hour. Too much talking. Realized this movie was for the new generation. Nick Fury finally makes an appearance during the last five minutes of the movie. Three hours of my life I can never get back. Gag me with a Smurf!",
        "The movie is average, but severely overhyped. There is nothing special and this really needs to stop being said as Marvel's best movie. Everything that it tried to add in the name of science fiction was extremely confusing and despite trying to make it seem logical, it simply comes off as mumbo-jumbo and in the end you are left confused wondering what just happened. It does not have any substance. Unlike Infinity War, which managed to hold itself together as a film, balancing all aspects such as action, emotion while also keeping the audience engaged and being understandable, Endgame is simply confusing. It is slightly redeemed by the final battle scene, and the visual effects and action is commendable, it does not completely redeem the film and it still remains an average experience.",
        "It's just the hype of the actors for which the audience are getting excited.",
        "It's just sad, that the best moment and best character drama was the bench that 'wasn't going to come back'.",
        "This I had to see...\n\nBut oh well, must be all those die-hard Marvel fanboys at it again.\n\nLot's of CGI, green screen and jokes in this SOAP OPERA with way too many characters. And yes, here comes the CGI villain again.\n\nIt wasn't for me.\n\nCaptain America: Winter Soldier is still the best Marvel movie.",
        "Let me start by saying THIS is how you wrap a saga!!!! I loved this movie, it was an emotional rollercoaster from open to close, and a fitting way to pay tribute to the legend of Stan Lee.",
        "First, half of \"universe\" died and the rest can't go on, all heroes was crying without a life sense. Can't believe that. A child on a bicycle angry \u00bffor what? He was too young to loose the faith. The humanity always rise after a war, even if they lost the war, Germany, URSS, Jews, Spain, Japan. Terrible film message.\n\nSecond, all the effort to bring out the Captain Marvel before the endgame and with the hope in her to solve the Thanos issue. For nothing, Captain Marvel do nothing... all expectations for nothing.\n\nAction only until the end, the rest of the movie was boring.\n\nThank god Marvel is over, no need to know nothing about Marvel Universe. It was almost a bad addiction finally cure.",
        "Emotional, Power and Meaningfully.\n\nRemarkable, Memorable.\n\nJUST 11/10.\n\nWow Marvel, Thanks for that Absolutely loved it.\n\n#AvengersENDGAME. #MARVEL.\n\nWhat a Movie.",
        "There is no way there can be so many legit 10 votes for the movie. Seems like a hoax to me.\n\nIt was so bad. Infinity war was way better.\n\nI went to see it partly because of the high rating, never trusting imdb ratings again. The studio must have fixed some high ratings to induce ticket sales.\n\nMassive waste of time and money.",
        "Long and boring time travel movie which makes no sense at all",
        "I dont see why people think its that great. We already know whats gonna happen. They just copy it from the comics. You want a good superhero movie. Make the movie first, then the comic book. It will save time and money.",
        "I don't know how the movie get 8.4....i was getting crazy couldn't wait till the movie is over, that much it's was boring and I didn't understand at all 3 hour what is it all about, from first til lthe end.",
        "This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of the MCU and this film absolutely delivered with emotion, visuals, action and comedy. The film may be long but it's certainly never boring. Check out this film because it is great!",
        "After watching Infinity War I was expecting another action-packed blockbuster. Instead it was mostly a snoozefest as they tried to get everything organized for the not-so-grand finale. When it finally did get to the finale it wasn't worth the wait. If you judge it by money made it was a huge success but as a movie it was a big letdown from Infinity War.",
        "Real shame this movie didn't stick the landing as I'm a big fan. Enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so but after that the movie can't decide on a tone, many of the jokes fall completely flat and many character decisions are made purely for fan service instead of servicing the story. By the end I was left with a movie confused about its identity.",
        "Only the final fight is good, remaining movie is all too much emotional drama for a Marvel movie.",
        "Agreed with the fact of overhype but the logic, the un necessary humor during time travel sequences, the almost no reason of captain marvel introduction before end game release, giving that shape to super smart Thor, .\n\n..All these events tell you that at the end it's just the Russo's wish to do whatever they want...\n\nWith out the mind applied to end game logic .....Why should I believe the Russo's.\n\nThey are just ordinary film makers",
        "Bella SGI e tutto ma il film \u00e8 velocissimo, non si capisce un c***o. Nel complesso \u00e8 carino ma ha una valutazione troppo alta.",
        "Man! I thought Infinity War was off the hook, but this one... A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second! Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years. Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around. It's fun it's dramatic, it's like Lord of the Rings with one less movie. Three hours well worth the ticket. Stan Lee would be proud! Nuff said!",
        "I can never be bothered with reviews but this films rating is beyond a joke. Plot is awkward and ridiculous... even for Marvel. Acting is non existent. Direction and editing just feels amateurish. I couldnt deal with anymore after the 1st hour it was excruciating. It feels like they gave a class of children the old \"how would you end the avengers\" lesson and just put all the answers in a bag and picked one.... and then just made it work.... or so they thought. I may feels the urge to watch the 1st half again and hope it inspires me to watch the conclusion but its highly doubtful.",
        "If u r a marvel emotional fan then the film is for you don't have too much expectations like previous marvel movies",
        "This was the most scatter brained writing for a Marvel movie I've ever seen. Just god awful.",
        "I fell asleep during this movie and haven't watched all the way to the end yet because it's so boring",
        "Watched midnight show here in Dubai.. Seriously the movie sucks big time.. I didnt like a bit.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is not a good movie. In fact, even when you like the Avengers, there are far better options to watch than this one, for example Infinity War. Endgame has lot of boring and cringy scenes, you really need to force yourself to watch it without skipping parts of it. Especially the fact that these \"Superheroes\" are still crying every day after Thanos snap and cant build up a life again was annoying af.",
        "It just doesn't. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's entertaining and nostalgic. It also does cap off the story in a good way. However, there were a bunch of fan theories online before this movie came out that would have made for a far more interesting adventure. Captain Marvel did not need to be there and I think that Disney made a huge mistake with that character (and, especially, \"actress\"). I'm not going to spoil anything, so I'll just leave it there. Worth a watch, sure. Infinity War was hundreds of times better in story and execution.",
        "I liked ''Infinity war'' very much . In fact , it was a motivation for me to see the other superhero movies in order to understand the entire plot of the series . '' End Game ''is a total disaster . I was sitting in my chair waiting two hours for the movie to actually begin . While ''Infinity war '' was an almost non stop combat with mind blowing CGIs , ''Endgame'' is far from it . I am just wondering what's in the mind of those who gave between 7 - 10 stars .There are two posibilities : the lack of critical rationality or , perhaps, they are first class fans who swallow everything Marvel releases . I was being indulgent by offering 3 stars . And I think many of you will share my point of view .",
        "It was not the best but it was like ok the first half kind of got boring then after the interval it gets more interesting and epic",
        "What is this terrible movie not interesting actions no good story wtf are you doing?",
        "After two hours of absolutely nothing happening, I walked away. A complete and utter waste of time and money. How long do you expect me to wait for SOMETHING to happen?",
        "I live Marvel .I love Superheroes.I love MCU and I loved Infinity War.The way I left the hall after I watched Infinity and The way I left the hall AFTER watching Endgane was completely different.So much hype and well deserved too but the ending was just not satisfactory at all.I liked bits of it but the other bit I just forced myself to like it just because I've been a fan of the creators and the actors and the characters for so long.But no It was not what I wanted not what we deserved.",
        "I think what going on with the high score and usually it settles down a little bit lower as time goes on. But I think we're seeing what happen when the dark Knight came out. A ton of people were voting perfect or near perfect scores for the dark Knight so it could overtake the godfather.when they hadn't even seen it I think that's what's going on here yesterday there wasn't even 1000 votes at 11:30 Eastern time there's almost 11,000 votes what I mean votes are from 1 to 10 stars. I thought IMDB fix this problem but apparently not now the average matrix score is 78 that's what they should really go by now course on the worst site ever rotten tomatoes is that a 97 but the most important part is that almost 8.3 is the average score of the people they gave it a fresh review. Rotten tomato will take anybody that will review they don't care if you're a real film critic or not",
        "Really, people think this is like 8.9?\n\nThis means i am really getting old. I love Infitinty war and i went to the theater like super-hyped. During the movie i wanted to like everything, then when it was over I thought, man it was bad. I am sad, how is this possible?\n\nI am ok that this is being bad. But why people think it is ~8-9? it is a good 6 max 7, but noooo...",
        "For a Marvel movie it was ok, better than most. However this has no place being higher ranked than Schindler's list, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, Every Kubrick movie ever made and many more. People should take of their Marvel fanboy hats and stop shoving these movies to the top. I'm not saying you shouldn't enjoy them, but stop inflating the reviews just based on the fact that you grew up with the characters and judge them on the movie itself.",
        "I kind of couldn't like it better than the infinity war at first but now that I keep finding myself going back to watch their time jump scenes and watching the final battle scenes over and over and over again, I realized something... infinity war started with a bang - Yes, Loki dies, Thor and Hulk we powerless but cut to Dr. Strange and Wong - casually going out to as happy friends before Hulk shows up - Cut to Tony - Strolling around with Pepper discussing the wedding, Peter Parker on a school bus with his friends - Scarlett and Vision enjoying freedom - You get the point - Infinity War was about the Avengers regrouping which is why the theme of the movie was bright and why we all loved it so much but Endgame was about reclaiming which is why, the dreaded dark theme in the movie makes us feel so bad - our favorite superheroes defeated and which is why, I find myself looking for scenes after they get back together in their final attempt to undo what has been done and despite what the haters say here, that final battle will remain the biggest moment in cinematic history!",
        "After all the hype on social media about endgame I would assume I'd enjoy an action packed title but I swear I literally fell asleep halfway into it, (not even joking, I had to watch the other half when I woke up) infinity war was wayy better, more action less drama, hard emotion etc the works, but hey I'm not a fan of superhero movies.",
        "Don't get your hopes up, i literally cannot understand the high ratings for this movie, bad pace, bad story, Thor and hulk were both a joke in this movie, Infinity War was light years better...",

        "It was very slow at many parts of the movie, many of them unnecessary and there were many things that was left unexplained. I felt they the movie was directed to the new marvel fans and didn't give us marvel veterans the fan service we wanted. It was a rather good comedy, but the action that I was expecting was lacking. The was put out to be appealing towards society and media, and not to us fans of the series.\n\nI feel betrayed, but understand why it ended up like this. I get why people would enjoy it, but I didn't. This is the avengers, and therefore it is definitely a must-see, just not as great as it was expected..",
        "This movie marks a end of an era. No movie studie could do what marvel did. Some cheesy scenes but overall a great movie. Especially the end fight. That was so epic. I could see it a hundred time and not getting bored. Good ending. Good story arch.",
        "From the moment I saw the idiotic quantum tbeory scene, I realized that there the movie depended on a lot of bull sh to weave a crazy plot over different time zones and eras and different planets.",
        "As much as we might miss some of the characters who died in Infinity war, this avengers movie was not necessary. The story ended perfectly in last movie. I feel that this was an effort to bring back lost characters for whom most of the little boys and girls cried for in last movie... and in doing so, making tons of mistakes and dynamics change that made it near unwatchable. As much as it upsets people, Thanos was always right. And this was just a sad attempt in making him the unreasonable bad guy... sad.",
        "It was really bad. Incredibly slow. The plot was full of holes and they pretty much destroyed some of the best characters ever.\n\nJust a really bad movie.",
        "We already knew the story, the avengers trying to un-do what Thanos did in infinity war, for me this movie lacked of personality, I would have loved to see more relationship between characters, i liked the changes they did with some of them (Hulk), but there were characters that had insignificant appearances also. The pace was not that bad for the runtime, but in the middle of the film I was hoping to see more challenges for the characters, and more drama, it looked like the movie lacked of effort. For the budget they had, they should've done a very great movie. This one didn't surprised me, infinity war was way much better. Disappointing movie really.",

        "Thor's take on \"the dude\" was the best part of the movie.\n\nToo long and sentimental\n\nMost of the focus is on the original avengers which is good but many of the storylines were just not very exciting\n\nI would wait to see this on video",

But c'mon, it's ANOTHER super hero movie, you know what to expect, and you'll have to sit there for 3 hours to get your 1-2 cool scenes that you paid money to see. Having said that, it's a good movie, I don't think anyone will debate that. But I honestly feel like the treatment of some of the characters, what they turned them into for this movie, it just doesn't work for me personally. I think it got RAVE REVIEWS because it's a big achievement, a capstone, a sendoff. And it *IS* a big deal in that way, but as a standalone, objectively-analyzed, critically-evaluated superhero movie, it's just about as good as any of the other dozen or so that came before it.",
        "It's fair to say that this is a fitting climax not only to the avengers movies, but a large section of the Marvel universe. The film is action packed, generally keeps you at the edge of your seat, and remains faithful to the characters. It's long, but quite necessarily so.",

        "Too much whining! No coherency! Completely convoluted theory about time travelling. I thought they would make something great but what the hell was that!",
        "I hate it. Makers just have to make money, they make this worse in MCU and all superhero movies universe.",
        "So many others have captured how I felt about this movie, that regurgitating what they said would lessen their impact. So all I want to say is that this movie was slow, disjointed, badly executed in writing and a complete disappointment. Even my 9 year old grandson said it sucked. Sad....",
        "This film is no Masterpiece. The Russo Brothers phoned in for a relevant follow-up to Infinity War. The first two hours were incredibly dull and boring. This film was filled to the brim with Fan Service and not enough Original Story. The final hour was amazing and worth the price of admission. The movie could've been condensed and it could've gotten to the point sooner. The humor feels forced and lazy. The film was filled with jump cuts and reused camera shots from previous films. The CGI is well done. The acting is poor at points. Overall, this is an average film, with two-thirds of it falling under below average.",
        "I found the story and the rhythm of the movie so messy, slow and boring. Really expected more.",
        "Poor cgi for big budget movie! Nothing special in acting, regular things... Copy story from other movies like Inception and Star Trek.. Poor cinematography and soundtrack! General nothing special, nothing unique!",
        "My friend, who I'd taken for the movie, fell asleep during the show. Seriously.\n\nThe first hour or so of the movie will do that to you. Unless you are a fanatic fan of The Avengers. Maybe even then. I am and I was checking messages on my phone almost throughout.\n\nSad.",
        "Infinity war still better. Too many holes to go over. I love the MCU but this missed the mark in my opinion. I would watch infinity war over this hands down.",
        "This movie was really good. I remember my self screaming at the movies sooooo bad along with every other fan! I watched this movie 2 times at the cinema! It was something else! But still something was missing! I don't know what but I gotta say that infinity war was superior! At least for me!",
        "Acting extremely sub-par, terrible story, and a cheap piece of non directional fan service.",
        "Trying to avoid spoilers while expressing why so much of this film is just a fan service dues ex machina is just too difficult. A disappointing and cheap end to a decade's worth of popcorn films.",
        "Look if you are not a fan of marvel or the avengers then this movie will give a small satisfaction but if you are a marvel fan you are the passengers of this journey (2008-2019) then this movie will give you happiness,sadness,a lot of comedy and much more.",
        "Could have been an hour and a half and twice the movie.",
        "I watched this film on the opening day and I left disappointed. This movie is too fast paced and too easy plot with tons of loopholes. Infinity War was a great film compared to it and Guardians of Galaxy, Ironman series, Captain America 1 were far better movies than this one. Endgame is running on hype and the total collection seems huge because of way too overpriced movie tickets. This movie is made for only children of age under 12.",
        "If I were to see this movie in theaters again I'd have to buy 2 tickets. One for me and one for the person pointing the gun at my head.\n\nAnother super hero movie. I'd give it a 0 but I can't.",
        "It's over boring movie and wont reach the level of other marvel movies",
        "It looked like a cartoon movie. I think the director showcased in the movie whatever he saw in his dream.",
        "Such a high tension left from Infinity war , and then such fast bad solutions...with nonsense. bad sense of humor. i was disappointed. Maybe for teenagers around 14-15 years old thats pretty ok.",
        "If you ever get the opportunity to watch ALL of the MCU movies back-to-back, in time-line order, please do so. The sweep, impact, and momentum from each movie carries over to the final climax of Infinity Wars & End Game. Wow! I just finished watching all 22 of the MCU movies in plot-line time order on Disney+ (over a week) and was fundamentally floored as to the depth and breadth of these movies and the linking story line(s). What MCU has done is paradigm shifting to the motion picture industry. For example, to think that a minor, seemingly throw-away plot point(s), in the first few movies could be later utilized as a significant plot vehicle in later movies is ingenious in its execution. The forethought and planning in the multiple plot arcs across multiples movies is groundbreaking. Certainly, never has this consistant and exceptional level of movie-making ever been done across so many movies of the same common plot: the acting, cinematography, VFX, sound, editing, etc, etc. I can think of no modern literary work that is as deep and intellectual as these movies...and all from a comic book(s)!",
        "Saw this with my 2 sons who are huge avenger fans. We left the theater very disappointed. From my perspective this movie was rushed, bad acting and the same as the other. Re-watch the last avenger movie it's the same.",
        "Watched this on first day of opening. I was holding really high hopes, based on Infinity war, and i was really dissapointed. This movie has some good parts, and im ok with the final result, but the journey there was bad and really messed up. In general the whole movie felt like the main story is a couple of actors (and here i really mean actors, not theirs fictional characters) saying goodbye to marvel and mcu. Infinity war, Thanos, infinity stones, fate of universe, etc, seems just like a minor side story. Very, very sad waste of 3 hours.",
        "First half was really boring. But the climax was really appreciated.overall it's not the Movie we want",
        "What a waste of a film. The first hour was totallly wasted. Yes there were good bits in it, but a stupid story with a boring script couldn't save this.",
        "Long, boring, phoned in with lazy writing. The hard fact is that Avengers Endgame is less entertaining than watching a dog pinch a loaf on your front lawn. It is an awful movie.",
        "The worst movie in the world. the movie goes from being a superhero movie to a comic. Full of errors, ridicule and absurd situations. Horrible!",
        "A perfect film in everything, never boring and a wonderful ending",
        "LOVE LOVE LOVED this film. Great characters and storyline. Had you laughing and crying, shouting at the screen and grabbing for cushions. Glued from start to finish, and will most definitely be watching again and again.",
        "Usually I don't bother writing reviews. But .... how can such a thin manuscript and a CGI be allowed to come on the big screen. But if you think this is a movie worth 8.9, then be my guest... I'll watch Godfather in the meantime..",
        "Definitely a must watch. It's extremely entertaining and emotional throughout. One of the best marvel movies ever made. Although the time travel thing was not really a unique idea, endgame is still a fun to watch more than once. Great acting, great cast, great visual effects, this whole movie is just epic.",
        "Time paradoxes are glossed over, bad story writing, completely wasted my time",
        "With so many plot holes reshoots cringy and illogical scenes and replacing much better scenes with Disney'd. You called this cinematic event , infinity war was a cinematic event and always will be.",
        "An all you can eat experience, but as most \"all you can eat\" restaurants the food quality is not the best. Shallow plot with many loopholes. Total waste of time.",
        "This is my favorite film of all time better than the lord of the rings star wars e.t jurassic park and titanic for me PERIOD.",
        "Indulgent rubbish. Do yourself a favor and just watch infinity war because this film is boring and by the end, I just did not care anymore!",
        "To tell the truth the movie was meh. It made little to no sense and was severely over hyped. I only watched it for Thor. Who both marvel and the other characters made fun of.",
        "I just have to said that im grateful for this movie. The effects, the characters is all amazing. I love how its sad joyeful and a lot of emotions in a movie.",
        "This film is awesome, simples.\n\nThe ones saying it's rubbish etc are just trying to be 'Edgy'.\n\nDon't read the reviews. If you like comic\\super hero films, then this is a must.",
        "Whatever I say is a little bit the movie is a failure the worst that Marvel has ever taken.",
        "I'm a post-90s person, and I used to envy the \"previous generation\" : People who saw the final episode of the Star Wars Trilogy 40 years ago, and people who saw the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings series 20 years ago. The joys and sorrows of moviegoers are not the same, but now we have a common memory: Marvel Cinematic Universe. Thank you, avengers.",
        "I didn't like that they had to downgrade Thor and Hulk just make Iron Man and Captain America the ones that save the day. On infinity war, when Thor arrives to earth with the day.",
        "I didn't like being disappointed by it but it didn't do all the years of build up and the characters justice. It has good comedy but ultimately felt like a lacklustre way to end things. Less of an Endgame more of just an ending.",
        "Watching Avengers Endgame, What Did People See In This! Avengers Endgame! I really don't like soap operas! Boring!",
        "The movie lacked anything substantial. Infinity war was an epic yet end game tried to cram 21 movies into one. Plot holes everywhere with very little tying the movie together. It was almost too obvious with the direction of the plot. Infinity war had several stories which tied into one, yet endgame tried to do the same but got lost in too much meaningless jokes. Im really sorry for marvel studios but this was by far the worst movie in the marvel universe. Yes the fight scenes were good but the overall delivery was clunky and missing direction. I left the cinema super disappointed as the expectation was hyped up but the delivery was way below that expectation. I watched infinity war 3 times in the cinema, but i wished i waited for DVD for endgame, massive waste of money. Pretty much 2.5 hours of boring jokes and 30 mins of actual viewing pleasure. Anyone who votes this film above 4/10 has issues. The funny thing is, everyone online agrees with me.............",
        "Waste of money.. if this was nr 1 of 2 I wouldn't have seen nr 2.",
        "Don't waste 3 hours of your life. There are only special effects are interesting.",
        "What a let down. They ruined Thor & Hulk. Could have been amazing.",
        "Once again Marvel does a fantastic job bringing all these characters to the screen. The story is perfect and although the movie is 3 hours long it doesn't feel like it is. The acting is perfect. There are some beautiful scenes. The final battle is one of the best fights ever made.",
        "I think the movie is selling only due to it's predecessors, most of whom were built with great care and vision. action wise, infinity war was way ahead of this slow paced dashed hope. only relief at the end is that thankfully it's over and they can now focus on movies with one or two superheroes at max.",
        "Writing, effects and acting is brilliant in this movie.\n\nBefore watching this film, make sure you've watched all other marvel films in revolving around the characters, or prepare to have much go over your head.",
        "Soooooo bouring !! called action movie ??? seriously ! it is actually a sleeping pills !",
        "Lazy plotline used(timetravel) a good climax but the rest was pretty boring. Only people who love the mcu would think this is an above average movie.",
        "I do enjoy the ending but I am quite disappointed with Endgame's whole execution.\n\nIt felt like a slap stick comedy rather than the dark Avengers movie it was supposed to be. I don't mind jokes here and there, like in Infinity War, but it was a lot of it, even til the point that I found it disturbing.\n\nThor and Thanos was quite redeemed in IW but their portrayals here feels like a slap in the face. Are MCU even aware that Thanos was so well written that he has a fanbase?\n\nThis isn't a worthy ending for Phase 3 and MCU as we know it. It was just OK.",
        "It finally ended.\n\nEnjoyable with satisfying conclusions.\n\nThe end was never going to please everyone but I think they provided a good result.",
        "What a waste of 3 hours. Too long, boring and ridiculous.",
        "My kids were very excited to see this but I was more apprehensive. Really, the film is far too long, just unnecessarily. Parts of this film were very boring and were an ideal time for a cinema snooze! It had so much more potential but directors lost site of their aim. Disappointed.",
        "An Overrated movie because of marvel fans. Only last 1 hour was good .",
        "3 hours of boredom, pain, suffering and cheap fan service. One of the most overrated movies.",
        "More than half of the movie is boring with a very bad script",
        "Just couldn't not finish it. Felt like a Kardashian Endgame. glad i didn't pay, it any money. What has happened to marvel movies in general are those positive reviews bots or bought? There were less than 1/3 action. The rest were full drama, for a almost 3 hour movie doesn't seem realistic.",
        "Cheap dialogs, non sense violence. The only thing the movie has to offer is explosions. Is it really that hard to make quality superhero movies? Look at Christopher Nolan's series of Batman movies, those are quality films. This movie is flat, it can be consumed as fast food, nothing to offer really",
        "Just a basic superhero movie. 3 hours but not much going on.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War better than this movie. A film that cannot meet expectations.",
        "Doesn't deserve to be a sequel to The Great \"Infinity War\" . Highly Disappointed , Ruined the 20+ Movie Build-Up . Disappointed .",
        "Just wanna say me and my son watch this movie time and time again. Paul Rudd as ant man , and Chris the surfer as Thor , and everyone else even black widow and the cameos have made this movie a family favorite and all the other avengers and super hero teams too. Keep on keeping on and Shaka brahs..... surfs up somewhere :)",
        "What is this garbage? 3 hours of absolutely nothing but awful dialogue and boring misplaced fight scenes. Must be all the brainwashed Marvel fanboys who gave this movie a top rating...",
        "An awful repetitive superhero movie. I'm sad that is wasted 3 hours of my life, watching this atrocious movie.\n\nNot recommended.",
        "This is not a Marvel action movie. Watch only if you are a diehard Marvel stories fan. All the characters are looking tired and slow with no idea as to what they want to do. The movie lacks any serious special effects and is low on the high energy action that you expect from Marvel comics. The movie drags and the end does not end. No way anyone will see this movie a second time.",
        "There is nothing in this film for an adult to enjoy. It's a total children's film. Don't know what else I can say.",
        "It's a fine action movie for one time, jokes are good too. However, it lacks something that Infinity War had. As anyone else I've been waiting for the greatest hit the entire year. It's sad to admit but I left the theater with a feeling of disatisfaction.",
        "Okay after reading such amazing reviews for this film.I came to see this Film with anticipation that it will top all of the mcu movies,but for me honestly I think Infinity War is a better movie.But that doesn't mean it's bad,I think you just don't have to hype things and left dissapointed , but I was never dissapointed.This movie has a problem on pacing, it was slow and it looks boring, but hey! I was never bored because that is what this movie needs.Slow pacing and build up to an 2nd act and 3rd act of insanity.The characters are not just characters they are very human here ,so vulnerable and full of mixed emotions. The action scenes were really good and this movie is just pure enjoyment and will easily be in my top 5 favorite mcu movies but not better as Infinity War in terms of being a movie.(for me)and surprisingly Captain Marvel is better here than in her own solo movie and this movie is more emotional than Infinity War.Because two movies are presenting different emotions for it's audience to feel.This movie is such a beautiful experience.",
        "The whole movie had only 30 mins total of good scenes. they failed this time...",
        "Well, I've just seen this movie and although I am far from a fanboy of this genre I've seen enough of MCU films to comment that this one is far from the best. I really don't know where the 10 ratings are coming from, perhaps because people have seen the 21 previous films and have invested time in those and HAVE to like this one. I'm just glad it's all it's all over. There's better films out this year to look forward to. If you're a massive fan you'll give it 10, if you're not it's a meh.",
        "Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it!",
        "Avengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie, but it feels like one. Every character get an end to their arcs, and the film itself is a great conclusion to 11 years of movies, all of which have led up to this. I wont spoil the actual plot for those who haven't seen it (the trailers have been incredible at not revealing anaything), but I will say that it is full of surprises, shocks, laughs and tears. The fact that the film manages to be THIS good more than makes up for its few flaws. The final battle is probably the most fan-pleasing, epic and emotionaly packed action sequence in any superhero movie; it was the culmiation if 11 years of characters we've come to love and care about. This is what superhero movies are all about.",
        "I mean, is this not one of the greatest movies of all time? A sheer feat in filmmaking as well. How does one get all that cast in one movie? Only the Russo brothers can pull this off.",
        "Tbh its one of the most overrated movies because of these fanboys. You shouldnt even waste your time at the cinemas.",
        "It was extremely disappointing. Crammed every politically correct them down your throat.",
        "Long, boring, no story, no nothing ! Long, boring, no story, no nothing ! Long, boring, no story, no nothing !",
        "Wanted to love this movie like I did infinity war, but unfortunately endgame is like Amanda Holden's face, smooth but no emotion.",
        "Rereleasing was not a flag ship kind of thing. Yet great movie. And will look forward to see Katherine Langford in coming marvel movies.",
        "The worst mcu movie of all time. Don't understand all the hype this movie is getting.",
        "Worst of the Worst !!! After IW(which is amazing) this was a disaster. BAd bad movie !!!!",
        "Really nice film.\n\nI suggest to see this film after watching the previous movie of the mcu. It's a great film anyway but without the other movies you can't fully understand the story.\n\nIt's full of action scenes and the special effect are crazy.",
        "Don't waste your time, it's incredibly bad, 3 hours you will never get back.",
        "Marvel lost me in a suicide mission. The ending sucked big time, they ruined the hero's that made the marvel universe what it is. Plot sucked, execution was boring, ending horrifying, And for no reason!!! That's it no more marvel for me. I AM DONE WITH THIS NONESENSE TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.",
        "The whole plot in this installment of Avengers hinges on a rat that just so happens to touch a button, in a van...\n\nAlso, time traveling always ruins a movie. If they can travel back to NYC to 2012, then it means that the plot we saw in this movie, already happened in the first Avengers movie in 2012... It's all too silly.",
        "Unfortunately the cast and characters were not enough to carry this three hours of dribble. Once they decided to take on the time travel theme it really spelt the start of the end. The movie is horrible overcooked and confusing and makes many of the fatal errors shared by other time travel horrors",
        "No spoilers.\n\nThe movie had a nice closing of the past 10 years but is far from the best Marvel movie which I had hoped for.\n\nInfinity war is head and shoulders above it due to its high pace and perfect character combinations. Endgame is funny, emotional and provides more depth to main character heroes. However, leaves so many important things out of focus despite its 3 hour runtime. Also, surprisngly feels like the Russos missed many great opportunities to make the movie better.\n\nGo and see it! Still important piece if the puzzle.",
        "This movie is so trash. There's too many different gaps in the plot, the end battle was just a large cameo to show all the different characters but didn't show the uniqueness or power capable of all the different characters.",
        "Marvel universe has been giving us a lot of amazing movies since 2008 (iron man) . Endgame was a perfect movie to end the Era. It is a awesome crucible of drama , action , emotions , pain and what not ... enjoyed the movie a lot. I already watched this movie over 4 times and still cant get over it .",
        "This is the superhero movie we have been waiting for This is Part 2 of Infinity War and it just keeps getting better Not only this movie will be one of the best superhero movies but one of the greatest movies ever I don't have anything else to say about this amazing movie This is a must watch and prepare to be awed by the ending",
        "When you see a movie with a 8.5 rating then it must be brilliant. Sadly not the case here. This movie is hugely overrated. I've seen all the previous movies and they have all been great and I understood them. This one I was scratching my head thinking what on earth is going on? The plot was an incoherent ambling mess....too many characters, no flow or direction. This looked like a movie edited from bits of previous movies. I'm surprised this is rated so highly....I'm very disappointed that this was a lazy movie....a waste of 3 hrs.",
        "My mom is very critical about movies she's not interested in most of them unless if one her favorite so called 'good looking' actors are in the film. \"I really really liked the movie, at first I thought 'oh god when is it gonna end so I can go to sleep' but I loved the movie and it was better than the previous one that you made me watch\" is the exact thing she told me so as you can see she's not a geeky die hard Avengers fan and we watched it at 1a.m. by the way and she really loves her sleep and the previous movie she was talking about was Infinity War.",
        "It's not Perfect as we imagine, There is so many curious in avengers infinity war ending & that's why people came to watch this movie in theaters.. It's not the best movie in Avengers Series.",
        "Good movie wraps it all together. Ending was kinda dumb.",
        "This movie is only made for Marvel fans. Not like the other 21 Marvel movies. They were entertaining every moviegoer.But Endgame will entertain especially Marvel fans.",
        "This movie is so boring.Too many unnecessary details.You have to sit in movie for 3 hours so i dont think its worth it.I waa dissapointed and really sad after watching it.Dont waste your money and this movie doesnt deserve anithing accept 1.",
        "The movie was enjoyable but it has way too many plot holes.\n\nI personally think Avengers Infinity War is better than this.\n\nIt felt like this movie is too much of a try hard to impress the fans...rushing the plot in the end.\n\nIt left a bitter taste.",
        "Story is too weak to thrill anyone. the fighter and flying worms from thanos were supposed to die even at no strike. The culminating part (battle) of the movie was childish. 2/3 time was boring and ridiculous overacting scenes",
        "When you kill off two of the main characters the ones that weren't sjw and promote social Warrior BS I'm done. This was my end game don't waste your money your time those are two things it's hard to get back. And some sisters in the Marvel Universe none of us can go back in time what a joke.",
        "They got so many things right... then turned around and got so many things wrong.\n\nIf I had to guess there were many disagreements about how to go about this movie and it shows both in the writing, but also the pacing.\n\nIm sure this movie will go down in the record books both in money made and ratings, but there are so many movies in the MCU that are better written and better executed.\n\nIll watch it again once it comes out on dvd and see if a second viewing changes my opinion.",
        "La pel\u00edcula es bastante entretenida, muestra lo que dice que mostrar\u00e1 y como dice que lo har\u00e1 pero no avanza de eso, siempre se muestra como una pel\u00edcula totalmente fans service y para culminar esa era est\u00e1 bien pero siento deber\u00edan hacer algo menos para fans y hacerla como el fin de su era.",
        "It's the end of the story and the superhero. The old story is over and the new one is about to start. Let's take a few more steps on the path of memory. Old friends meet again. People who want to be superheroes become real superheroes. Lost time is also picked up in another parallel universe. There is no better ending.",
        "This movie picks up after the devestating events of infinity War that wiped out half of all living creatures. In this movie you can really feel a sense of urgency from the avengers. And the way the characters are taken is all very pleasing. The acting is some of the best in an avengers film. The 3 hour run time is not a problem what's ever and I could've happily sat watching it for 5 or even 6 hours without feeling it dragging on.",
        "The movie was ok. Not good. Not bad. Just ok. All the fanboys out there giving this an average rating of 9.1 haven't seen a 9/10 movie ever or simply vote this up this high because they haven't been cuddled enough as a kid or something.\n\nThe story was what bugged me the most. It wasn't exciting at all. Never once did I think ok this is a bad moment to go to the toilet or something. It really was that dull.\n\nThis is like the new star wars movies. Made for children who don't care about the plot and just want to see action and by now boring jokes.",
        "The actors are remarkable as always, however the writing was a bit poor. And some cringy jokes ruined this movie.",
        "I mean come on. Is this actually the best movie you've seen? How is this messy movie better than Guardians 1 or Winter Soldier? This movie shouldn't definitely even be in the top 50 on IMBD.",
        "Had high expectations for this movie, but is was the worst =(",
        "It's hard to admit that there will be a superhero movie among the top 10 in 2019. Tragic, epic, affectionate, these words, which did not exist in Marvel's dictionary, can be shown in this final chapter. For passers-by, this is a business masterpiece with self consistent logic, orderly rhythm and proper arrangement. For fans, this is a youth farewell ceremony with supreme feelings.",
        "It was a great movie, and I remember the excitement in the theater.",
        "The movie is good, but me and my teenage daughter and her friends saw it tonight and all were a bit disappointed. We all feel Infinity War was much better and I personally felt the first hour dragged out too slow and long. Don't get all the 10/10 scores.",
        "This movie is really amazing. It has dark theme and please do not compare it with infinity war because it is a sequal to that movie. A lot of hate is their on IMDb and I am still not able to understand \"why\". How can you saw that this movie is a bore \ud83d\ude10It is the end of all 22 movies so please try to understand",
        "The hype that was built and created totally overshadowed the movie, and came in very subpar. Even on a technical side of things parts of the movie felt rushed, not needed, useless or not thought out at all.",
        "Well overrated. I expected better, the previous one was better.",
        "Actually, I can't understand why that many people enjoyed this movie so much. It's boring, illogical, predictable etc. Just an average movie about superheroes. The first part was much better in any aspect.\n\nPerhaps it's worth watching one time, but no more.",
        "Another latex fetish fest with low IQ so called actors.\n\nYou are basically watch CGI. Crap movie with a crap ending as Thanos was your last hope!",
        "Short and to the point it was a lazy effort. Decimating beloved characters Thor and Hulk and using a weak \"Oceans 11\" plot to make it seem clever did not work. I watched it once and have yet to get over it.",
        "I don't have to give away any spoilers to say this movie was terrible. I was so excited to see this movie. First, I have watched every superhero movie that lead to the creation of this movie. Please don't believe the critic reviews or other obviously paid for reviews. This movie was horribly boring, with very limited action. I enjoy comicbook and fantasy movies, but I also enjoy a good drama. The issue isn't that I couldn't appreciate the emotional aspect of the movie, it's simply that it was done very poorly. There were so many issues with the plot, and characters, but worst of all is a tremendous amount of pointless, long sections of uninteresting dialog. On top of this, the very few action scenes that were in the movie were really poorly done. For the most part, they were a blurry, choppy mess, and you couldn't appreciate what was happening enough to make it effective and cool.

The building of the gods has collapsed and the body has become empty. Since we are different, let's say goodbye. Just because we know life and death, we no longer fear life and death; just because we look down on life and death, we can calmly die; because we love life here, we are still afraid of death; because I know you know I will die, so I dare to love you 3000 times.",
        "What a load of bs. What was this? The writers of this movie should never be given jobs again. The first two hours were a complete and total waste of time. A better story line would have made this the movie we all wanted, 2 hours long with a 45 minute fight scene. But you couldn't be bothered to do this could you? You wrote the movie YOU wanted. Not what we wanted. Screw this over-elaborate, slow moving piece of absolute garbage!",
        "Despite what others may say or have said this film was far from predictable. I certainly lost my bets. I both laughed and cried during this film.

        "Seems that they separated every good parts and put them in Infinity Wars and leftovers into this one. Plot is ridiculous, with most of the heroes unused/underused. Are those actors even involved in making of this movie? It is more like clip show episode, made of chaotic parts from previous Avengers, where even CGI quality is different or in the worst case, they combine new things into old scenes, so difference in quality is even more obvious.\n\nTime will lower rating of this movie when hype stop. Now, this movie is first one in All time worldwide gross, so it will be more criticized (Avatar can rest now).\n\nI watched it in full cinema in first days of screening. We laughed on stupidity of some scenes (every one in theater). At the end, on exit, after 3 hours of painfully boring and bad movie, nobody talked about it... Just wanted to leave this misery behind it.",
        "I don't care what any critic has to say, but the MCU is brave and brilliant. This interweaving, interconnecting series of 22 films (23 with Spiderman Far From Home) has gone from strength to strength and I absolutely love Endgame as it basically closes the curtain on the Infinity Saga.\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe works because it is character driven!\n\nWhen Cap wields Mjolnir, I basically nearly peed in my pants with excitement.\n\nBravo Marvel for breaking the mould.\n\nI cannot wait for more",

Every superhero had their own space to express themselves and it is beautifully managed by the directors.

I'm not sure why people are worried about spoilers as the same thing happens in every movie.

The Avengers with the rest of their allies assemble to reverse what Thanos did and restore everything.\n\nI have to admit that I was expecting this movie after watching the \"Avengers: Infinity War\" because I wanted to see what will happen next. So, I had high expectations by this movie and thankfully I was not disappointed at all by it. The direction which was made for one more time by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo was simply outstanding and they followed their successful pattern and way. For one more time the interpretations of the cast made the difference and their combination proved why was so successful through all those movies including \"Avengers: Endgame\". To sum up, I have to say that \"Avengers: Endgame\" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",
        "This a garbage movie with no sense at all...nothing justified...too way boring...very little action at the last 45 minutes and still nothing impressive...i will not waste my time again and continue my review...just do not listen to the postive reviews which i suspect they are not real reviewers...my advice is to save your money and your time as well.",

I have expected epic adventure movie with comic characters, and I've got summer family action flick with good humor, mediocre sound and 8/10 effects. Wasn't a waste of money, but doesn't live up to its hype.",
        "Pandering to the politics of the day created one shot during the epic battle of ALL of the female characters that this female found trite and patronizing. 2 or more other major plot decisions are also a betrayal of the fandom by surrendering to the tyranny of identity politics. Uneven and contradictory handling of the characters and plot decisions created a long list of plot holes and distractions .... compare Spiderman's friend and Ant Man's daughter. There are touching and heartfelt moments ... happy and sad tears shed. Sadly, those are diminished by the distractions of the plot issues. The 7 rating was a nod to the efforts of the players, despite the machinations of the script.",

It's nothing more silly face mimics.\n\nThe cinematography and video effects are eye-catching but I'm not impressed since we are in this era.",
        "It takes some time to get going. Then there is this obsession to try to be funny, that is sometimes a bit annoying. The Final Battle is way to overloaded and that not very subtile feministic scene at the end of the battle is kind of pathetic (you will get what I mean, when you see it). I love female superheros, but that particular scene doesn't make sense at all. Please stop ruining good movies, with political statements. It's worth a watch, no doubt, but I was kind of disappointed. Its way to melodramatic for a freaking superheromovie.",
        "Such well written time travel script inrelate to different marvel movies and time period with refference so good old memories , Apart from bit slow start (which is quite acceptable) ,when the script takes pace movie will be full in action and thoroughly engaging.\n\nCliamx was damn of lit, which is the best so far that a ending sequeal can demand.\n\nApart from movie facts, politically marvel took a strong step of centralising and impact of women characters in action sequens and even in climax scenes too.\n\nWhen its final sequel to series to get the utmost satisfaction must watch prior ones too.",
        "Hulk & Thor massively underpowered & underused! Such a let down for such a build up over 10 years & to follow on from pretty much perfection with Infinity War to this is just madness.\n\nSome great scenes but the movie overall didn't flow well for me.",
        "Ruined all the previous movies just for the sake of fan service. And \"Time Travel\" it looks good if it has a small part in it, but making a whole movie out of it is stupid. So many plotholes....",
        "Not going to go into any spoilers I just felt that overall the movie was average, it did a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. The acting was decent, the action scenes were good if few and short and the pacing wasn't atrocious.\n\nBut there were flaws, Brie Larson could have been replaced by a cardboard cut out, some of the twists made little sense and the big fight was rather unsatisfying and had a really cringy scene (you'll know it when you see it)\n\nUltimately it's worth watching but the people rating this a 10 are overly hyped or wearing blinders because there were more than enough flaws evident throughout the movie. Basically go in expecting an alright action flick and you'll enjoy it.",
        "Although throughout the movie you kinda expect what is happening, Avengers Endgame closes out the 10+ years of MCU greatly and opens up nicely new ways for future MCU films to come, it's definitely an unforgettable experience and a must watch for every MCU Fans, Non-MCU Fans might feel lost in this one. 10/10 for MCU Fans. 7/10 for Non-MCU Fans.",

I Hope someone that can make a diference (like an avenger) read this and understand.",
        "Now, I know I'm not a movie critic but I can tell you that this movie definitely does it's job. Endgame was one of my fave movies definitely and it succeeded and I like seeing this franchise succeeded. Though at some times the writing did get a little repetitive onto infinity war it still did it's job and provided. Also someone tell the producers fortnite isn't a good game! The deaths are extremely sad. Cried only on the one though aka the girl death! Honestly great movie great wrap up. This franchise deserves so many movies to come!",
        "Basically there was 2 hours of crying then action then 30 minutes of action and finally topped it off with 30 more minutes of more crying! I fell asleep at the beginning! Infinity war was a much better movie!",
        "It s a joke after another joke. No pathos. No Drama. I m a diehard fan from comics, and they kill all my dreams and expectations. It was impossibile to fail the movie after the masterpiece of IW...but Disney is Disney: they must follow specific political choiches without really caring about it (race and sexual politics), and it s all a mess. What a miss opportunity...",
        "To start off this is just a groundbreaking movie in cinema. It has great character and great performances. Visual effects as always are stunning. I though the concept can be a little better. Other than that the movie is a masterpiece.",
        "It was a marvels fans dream. Loved it all the way. The perfect end to all the fans, giving moments of full action. Avengers: Endgame shows an incredible connection between all the movies of this amazing universe developed among eleven years. Yes it slows down a bit. But over all a visual treat I must say.",
        "I did enjoy the first half of the show. It was subtle and emotional. This was the first time ever in the franchise that they show us the capability of the actors they hired (except for Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland of course as they have been pretty much one-note. Well, it might be because of the script. They can still prove their ability in many other movies in the future).\n\nThen the action part came in. The central theme of the Avengers franchise. The time traveling was intriguing and everything, but seriously the end was a mess. That scene with force-feminism was \"cringy\" to its best. The death of the character(s) also felt forced and unnecessary.",
        "The first part of the movie is a sitcom, talking and dad's jokes. It almost(!) catches up with \"Friends\". If only movie was released in 1999... The second part is even worse, It reassembles \"Back to the future\" but it definitely does not catch up even to 1989. And there is this third part. Explosion of... left-wing ideology. You will instantly get a T-CD4 lymphocytes drop and vomit with rainbows. It ends with: SPOILER ALERT Capitan America being now black. The CGI is great, I enjoyed it very much. But the best part of the movie was a trailer before. There is still hope in this modern world. \"Bad Boys\" are still black and still as brilliant as in 2009. I'm looking forward to watching them again.",
        "That is horrendous for Hawkeye.\n\n\"Was it juice pops?\" ... Cute.\n\n\"Lebowski\" ... Killer dialog :)\n\nI see the Iron Man help style has trickled down to everyone.\n\nHulk fake mad :)\n\nYou thought The Squad was tough...",

        "The movie was great, there's no doubt about it, but that was it. Coming off the shock value that Infinity War brought meant that nothing in this film surprised me, actually there really wasn't any surprises- everything was just as you'd expect it, which was slightly disappointing in itself. I remember after infinity war, people in the cinema were speechless, crying, sobbing, hugging each other - there was nothing like that here. I wish there were more surprises. It was also a little slow overall but at the same time a good celebration of the last 11 years.",
        "Overall this was a good movie. Character screen time was definitely not split as well as the last outing. Just seemed like a long build up for a poorly lit end battle. Again, a good show but not up to the standard that I have grown to expect for Marvel.",
        "Horrible movie. Boring and poorly written. I don't understand the high rating or the hype. I didn't even finish watching it because it was so awful. I love all of the Marvel movies, but this one was unwatchable. What a waste of a perfectly good Saturday night.",
        "3 hours of too much wasted plot. Instead of introducing deeper on new characters.",
        "It's down on my list of best marvel movies, I just don't feel like watching it again. Honestly, as well, if I hadn't seen it, and Infinity War was the final of the series, I might be happier with that. That said, this film is more entertaining than sitting in a dark room doing nothing, and it does actually conclude the Avengers storyline, it doesn't conclude in a great way, but it concludes. I feel that Marvel movies have suffered since the loss of Stan Lee, and have certainly lost their neutral integrity, allowing certain political ideologies to take priority on screen, at points, over internal logic or entertainment value.",
        "Burn you Scorsese Blurays for another marvellian mass production... ummm... product is here! Let's get some CGI going, so happy we do not understand even the basics of the human psyche. Let's make sure no-one does! Let us judge everyone for we are truly better. Let's keep that PC flag flying high. Let's not see anything that it real, let's polish the world. We all hate real movies. Alpa Chino truly stands for Booty Sweat. Thank you so much!",

        "A lot of films take you on an emotional roller coaster but for us Marvel fans, this was the creme de la creme. A masterpiece. If you nit-pick any film you'll find holes on top of holes. Continuity errors. Things that happen without reason. This movie has so many super heroes in it, the amount of logic errors are mountainous and also, who cares? We don't watch these movies to pick them apart. We watch them to escape our universe and temporarily enter theirs. This movie could have been better in many ways but it was damn near perfect with all its flaws. Reminds me of humans...",

So disrespectful to the viewer and the comic books and the fans. A bloated hollow commercial project by the Disney sith.",
        "Avengers infinity war left us in such a state of mind where we didn't know what was going to happen next. We start off mourning the loss of our heroes and need to find out how to bring them back. Without spoiling anything all I will say is this movie is amazing and definately one I'm glad to have seen in the cinema which made the experience that much better.\n\nHowever I do recommend watching infinity war first as it is a direct follow up and also amazing!",

        "I've expected much more as it was the final chapter but to be honest infinity war was much more interesting and mind banding, the story happened in the end game I expected them almost all of them before watching the movie so I was waiting to be proved wrong and get excited unfortunately I wasn't, End game was more emotional rather than interesting, they paid too much attention to viewers satisfaction they did what emotional viewers would have wanted.\n\nEnd of the story",

        "Great visuals and sound, solid acting and directing. A few problems with the plot, mostly surrounding the use of time travel (can't say more without major spoilers but it's mostly consistency issues). But overall a solid finale to the first three phases of the franchise.",
        "Think I've watched a different film to most reviewers! It's too jokey too cheesy and too long, infinity war was brilliant this is well below that level.",
        "Just like Iron Man 3, there was way too much Disney and not enough super hero. Infinity War was infinitely better (pun intended), and just like the Iron Man series, I've watched the first ones multiple times but the last only once. I won't watch this again and should have waited until it came out on bluray. There wasn't a whole lot that was shocking, a lot was predictable if you've been paying attention, and a lot had too much Disney influence. There were a lot of people in the theater checking their phones and had head resting on their hands before this was even over. Disney has wrecked another franchise.",
        "A solid beautifull beginning... If you have everything of marvel this will be a beautiful ending.. There is always a but... It's not worth mentioning it... Just go see it's every comic readers wet dream come true\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d",

        "Nothing special. It was boring. I'd rather watch the phantom menace.",
        "No idea where what everyone else watched but this movie was bad. A million questions unanswered and the solutions used were the worst. Not going to spoil but you'll see.",
        "I personally preferred infinity wars. This movies was so preditable and had so much feminist propaganda that it didn't feel natural at all. A balanced group of characters usually goes best. There was some funny moments to be fair and some few action scenes, but in general this movies just feels very commercial and does not manage to get my attention at any moment. The vilains were not great either!",
        "A great ending to the phase 3 of MCU. The film's climatic battle is way better then any of the battle in infinity war and more emotionally charged than its predecessor. The background score was tremendous with equally good cinematography. People who rate low emphasis more on plot holes and goes way more technical than required. A film's job is to provide entertainment to its audience which it does satisfies.",
        "I love this movie. Even though it Iis quite sad in some areas, they could still fit it some jokes.",
        "Disney knew it was going to make a ton of money from this sequel and so it feels like everyone involved in its production, from directors, writers and actors etc. just didn't bother turning up - aside from collecting their pay cheque. Anyone with a reasonable amount of intelligence and maturity will know the movie undelivered massively. Perhaps trying to weave characters in and out of previous movies took their eye off the quality of the offering. For those who have rated it a 10, once their excitement from all the anticipation dwindles, reality will sobering. Shame all the previous quality, especially infinity, has this movie associated. I should've known something was amiss when cpt marvel turned out to ba a total waste of time. MCU Phase 4...? You can shove that up your....!",

        "I've grown up with the MCU with Iron Man coming out when I was 5 years old. I love this series and it's sad that the main saga is over but I expected a bit more. I gave Infinity War a 9/10 because of its amazing pace, fun characters and unexpected gut-wrenching ending, but this film has sluggish and inconsistent pacing, ruined character arcs (like Hulk as in IW he was afraid to even show himself but now they sorted everything out... Off screen), and a very predictable story and ending. I'm not even joking when I say that (even though my prediction was slightly different) my prediction to the film was extremely accurate to the films events.\n\nTo conclude, I watched Infinity War 3 times in cinemas and who knows how many times on Blu-Ray, but I've only seen Endgame once and have no intention of seeing it again anytime soon: I liked it, but was overall disappointed.",
        "The script was slow moving and often lazy. After being so precise and covering all the bases moving up to this movie, it seems Marvel really let go on this one. They left several loopholes unexplained. Overall the movie was worth watching, but I thought Infinity Wars was much better.",
        "Solid 3 out 10.\n\nThey had one job. Create a great action movie without involving politics.. Really it must've been extremely hard to write a good ending to this series. I did like parts of the ending, but trying to shoehorn in a political message and the additional character cpt marvel just felt so forced and ridiculous it just made me cringe. There was one scene in particular, and you will know which one I mean when you watch it. A real shame. It's like the writers were forced to include an element that they really didn't want to have..",
        "Loved every second so much that I went to see it at the cinema 3 times in the space of 3 weeks from the date it was first released :D.",
        "What can I say but WOW! This has to be one of the most boring movies that I have ever seen in my life. I loved Infinity War but Endgame on the other hand is utter trash. Way too many fanboys overlooking major plot holes. Personally I would give it around a 6. However, seeing how many people are giving this a 10, to try restore some semblance of balance, I will give it a 1.",
        "Nothing to say a pop corn movie, marvel must to create R category movie",

        "This movie is better than joker. Hm.. Totally suckss. Couldn't understand a single thing.",
        "Man what a let down after Infinity War. Virtually no action in a superhero movie. Predictable plot with lame time warping around all over the place. And what in God's name did you do with Thor's character after the last movie holy crap! So glad I didn't waste my time in a theater for this one.",
        "Saldly is the last movie , I had my doubts about this movie, but it came trough, i like the story , the characters , actors are in tip top shape with the roles.\n\nJosh Brolin, brother, u played very well thanos, you know is a well played when I want to hurt you ,torture and then kill you, bring you back to life and kill you again. I felt so much angre and hate for thanos, i want it to fight along The Avengers just to see thanos dead. To bad that we will never see this team togeter anymore.",
        "Avenged Endgame serves as a super nice popcorn movie. But the building-up for the final battle happens way too slow, way too dull. The battle itself is epic but ends too soon in my opinion. Some of the punchlines in the film seem too contrived and almost bored me into tears. The movie tries to dig in all the main characters but fails to convey the depth. With that said, the visual and sound effects do deserve being appreciated in an IMAX movie theater.",
        "10/10 i loved it. It has fanservice and its a really epic movie. I remember in the crowd screaming when captain lifted thor Hammer. I liked more infinity but this is one is a really awesome movie.",
        "I swear this movie is the worst thing i've ever seen of my life. Marvel, it's over for me",
        "First thing is Thor is a stronger character that can make huge changes without stark's Death Second thing is captain America can have Thor's power because oden whispered to his hamer that one will have it only So the mistakes I saw there was Thor was useless and captain America got his power Third thing is captain marvel didn't make any changes so the purpose of this character is making money !!!!",
        "This movie has to doso much and bring together so many different characters and to resolve the situation from Infinity War in a satisfying way, and they did it! I love re-watching this movie, it's amazing.\n\nI think some of the plot points are a bit contrived, but overalliit's just amazing that they pulled it off so well.",
        "You can't put a rat that saves the heroes and call it best movie",
        "Just saw it for the second time. Actually worse than I remember. Still a bit frustrated over how \"Hulk-situation\" turned out, as in no endgame fight with Thanos :-/ Too many jokes. It's not a comedy. Too long. Too much 'girl power'....and yeaahhh I know we live in that time were girls has to be as good as men, and were Superman and the little mermaid has to be black...but still!!\n\nAnyway. I downgraded my rating. The movie doesn't deserve a higher overall rating than 7/10",
        "This must be one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen. They tried to create humor, sadness but it was just pathetic.",
        "Unnecessary emotions, focus on only Captain America and Iron man, Role of Thor is just for joke.",
        "Had a lot going on. Expected a lot more emotions to be evoked. Left me asking for more in a negative way. Moved too fast. Other than the fight scene, which envoked the feel cause of its grandeur, nothing actually makes a lasting impact on you",
        "I am not a Marvel fans so I hadn't seen many marvel movies so far . I think a good movie especially such magnitude like avenger 4 should let most people can understand content even I didn't see other marvel movies before. As a non marvel fans moviegoer , avenger 4 is not a good movie for the audiences like me . So that why I think this movie has wild room to improve because I still think audiences like me are not the minority",
        "Endgame is a fun,action packed blockbuster that concludes many arcs but although it's enjoyable there are moments that were predictable but overall I liked it. I'm going to give Avengers:Endgame an 8.5/10.",
        "Best movie ever.\n\nWaiting for more movies from marvel studios.",
        "This movie was not what I expected. Infinity war was way better in terms of visuals, fight scene ans story wise. This movie was boring it and too long. Only first 15 minutes and last 30 minutes of the movie were entertaining.",
        "This film is 181min long and only 5min are good. The rest is just boring...",
        "Best film I've ever seen however there was no excuse for Daisy Johnson and Robbie Reyes (arguably the 2 most powerful characters in the whole MCU) to just not turn up at all!",
        "This movie proves the Russo brothers are in a league of their own when it comes to closing a franchise this big. In my opinion they pulled of the most satisfying ending this story arc could have.\n\nIt's nothing without its previous 21 movies. Must watch for every movie fan.",
        "Absolute trash!! The ending was terrible I felt like there was no closure there was so many mistakes it was sooooo cheesy and the storyline was absolute trash. We deserved so much better. Nothing will top infinity war this was an insult. It had its moments but there was very few",
        "Can't believe all the bad reviews. This was a great film that will last for decades. It's funny that some reviewers say this would never happen in real life, of course not dummies open your imagination.",
        "Watched this more than 10times but still having goosebumps in the end.",
        "So emotional. One of the best marvel movies of all times if not the best. I am in love. Watched it like 10 times. Can't get enough. Cried so much!!!!!!",
        "This is how you make a finale, damn. It's very good and emotional, and managa to perfectly conclude 11 years worth of buildup. No other movie can achieve what endgame has.",
        "Avengers: Endgame will be a film that I will never forget. When I first saw it I loved it. It serves a satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga with how it wraps up what was started in Infinity War while giving wonderful send offs to some of the most recognizable characters that we've grown to love ever since 2008. Overall, this movie was fantastic and personally is and will be a film that is not forgotten due to it being such a satisfying conclusion to the already great Infinity Saga",
        "Writting about time traveling is always difficult. But there's been so many inconsistencies in this movie that I lost Interest after 1hour watching. The writting was so poorly done that I felt no emotions and got bored at some point. Infinity war were so well done that I'm really surprised that the last Avengers movie turned down like this.",
        "After Infinity war I thought we would get a epic conclusion. That is no where near the case. I have no clue what the people rating it 10 watched, there must be two versions. This one movie pretty much ended my love of marvel films. And will be my likely be my last. Terrible writing ruined and killed off beloved charters. I like how Captain America was handled. But wrong person got shield. The movie was 2 and a half hours of garbage. With 30 minutes of ok action. Had a couple good moments but that's about it. What a huge let down from everyone involved. Save your money wait for it on Redbox.",
        "Again a best movie from Marvel.. But it has some drawbacks but also a It will be a beautiful experience to watch our superheroes..",
        "There's only one word to describe Avengers endgame and it's EPIC. The scale of this movie is incredible. Well deserved to be the highest grossing film of all time. Watching Endgame in the cinema was the best movie experience I have ever had. I'm so incredible impress how they manage to wrap all those movies in such a satisfying way. If you aren't a marvel fan or haven't seen the other movies I'm sure you will enjoy it just from the incredible action, entertaining story, amazing CGI, the performances and so on.",
        "They robbed us with the last move, for goodbye! It is all about the money!",
        "Avengers: Endgame is a well-made and well-deserved victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It ties in many different storylines from previous films and allows you to reminisce while also saying goodbye to characters you've known and loved. This film has some flaws, of course, but it also made some bold choices and surprised me a number of times. I laughed. I cried. I loved this finale to the Infinity Saga.",
        "Sir please add IMAX VERSION of this movie. ALL the movie is so great that every time i watch it gives me more details. And today is the day when i watch it again so add it as soon as possible.",
        "Avengers endgame might be long but it feels like the fastest 3 hour movie I've seen. Everything works even with the few plot holes. The action is evenly paced and works where they put it and all leads up to the greatest climatic battle scene in a long long time.",
        "You remember, when kids, how cool it was when Bruce Banner got mad and became hulk without control? How cool the old spiderman movies were (tobey mcguire as actor)? Superhero movies have become franchising for kids, making them more funny than how they were before and they just feel different. I can really see that they are targeting little kids. These movies are NOT anymore for older people too.\n\nThis movie was most of the time trying to be funny, sometime being, but the superhero part was just not feeling like it made me feel years ago (even the first avenger movie was cool). That feeling of \"Omg, wow, this gavee me goosebumps\" is gone with Marvel's movies. Hulk that became rational and not anymore the violent Irrational beast? Thor fat and drunk? Other characters just boring. Superheroes movies don't feel like it anymore. They are cute for little kids but I felt really stupid watching it as a 25 years old.",
        "Believe me I wanted to love this movie. But its very \"Dull\" slow and Lengthy .It was pointless to make 2 films, They are just fooling audience and fans. And audience are falling for traps.\n\nEvery situation is so predictable that it gets you out of the movie. This level of \"nothing new\" is damaging to the story as it stops you from caring about anything.",
        "I just love how the people hate it when the Youtube rewind comes out, and swallow the same agenda in a Marvel outfit. The whole plot is non existent, spiked with some fanboy pleasing absurdity and the compulsory fake sciense which doesn't make sense at all. The main contradiction is in the overall mood of the movie. In one second they emphasize how terrible everything is, then next minute they come up with at best a nose exhaling joke. The only good thing was that Captain Marvel barely appears on screen. Huge missed opportunity of adding a Fortnite dance to the end of the great brawl, would have fit the spirit of the whole movie.",
        "I expected an action movie with a real battle. Unfortunately it was just a loong and boring exchange of lines..",
        "This movie is everything that fans and viewers wanted it to be. It clearly shows that the makers have put their heart and soul into the movie instead of just making money out of the popularity.\n\nIt is 3 hours long but never felt like it. The sequence of emotions in the movie is sad, cheer, laugh, cry and repeat.\n\nWatch it before it gets spoiled for you!!!",
        "Breathtaking. Endgame raises the bar so high. The emotion, comedy and action all combined to produce a movie of epic proportions that probably won't be matched for many years to come! The best MCU movie. Easily one of my all time Top 5 favs.",
        "Even if i really loved infinity war and i consider it to be one of best comic book films ever made in scale and heart,but i must say that i loved endgame even more since it doubled all that things and made them even better,and it give us great conclusion to the era of mcu since 2008,endgame had brilliant actors that did a marvelous job and i think that werent any weak link,thanos maybe less focused then in infinity war but still he was able to bring staff that we love about him,this film also has some very sad moments with emotional punch but i think that they did a great job in closing characters arcs and stories,sure there is some staff about time traveling that is messy but in this kind of film i simply dont care",
        "From a fans' perspective, this has a lot of rewatchability value, but the plot holes bring down the whole franchise retrospectively. The directors took some creative choices that, for the most part, paid out, but watching this movie after the others in this franchise is a let down. Some heroes act out of character and although I felt the tension in the first couple of acts, the third one really didn't do nothing for me. Infinity War was better constructed, but this had more heart.",
        "Such a let down & huge disappointment! Infinity War was beyond amazing & perfectly setup for the best ending anyone could ever imagine, until you see this movie. I can't believe the Russo Brothers willingly destroyed our favorite characters we have been built up to love & cherish all these years. The plot holes are continuous & the only thing you learn to count on in this flick. The 1st half is boring & dragged out only to later have nano seconds with the anxiously awaited returned. Such a waste & felt like being robbed of those moments you couldn't wait to see! Beloved Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow and Hulk are all ruined!! The charisma & pizazz is sucked out from all of them. Felt like it was written to only care about Captain America & Hawkeye. There are very few cool moments because it leaves you confused & wanting answers to the new plot holes. Unnecessary deaths & destruction end this era of fine films in to depression & just a ton more questions you feel you deserve answers to after being so loyal & attached. This was supposed to wrap things up & feel like an ending. Nope!",
        "Perhaps some fans expecting a colossal/great war between thanos against the remaining avengers. But what endgame provide is simply an unlogical storytelling. First, they really dont know how to put captain marvel in the story. Second, there should be 2 gamora after hulk use the stones. Third, is that really hard to beat thanos while in the beginning the rest of the avengers easily chop thanos' head. Fourth, captain marvel make it too difficult to hold thanos' fingers for flicking? All of those issues are not sensibly accepted. The plot is too shallow, and they try to force the story to be realistic which absolutely uninteresting and rubbish.",
        "Cheesy and dumb. They could have done so much with this movie, but completely failed. There was WAY to much comedy and PC moments. Definitely a waste of time and money.",
        "I wasted 3 hours from my live. Captain Marvel was much more interesting. It is like this movie is done just to be released, i don't believe that initial idea for this movie is what we watch now.",
        "At the beginning just nothing special totally no need 3 hours for the movie....",
        "I have loved the MCU for years but I am more than diappointed with this movie. #\n\nSuperficially is felt similar to the others even though the plainly obvious addition of emotional scenes to wrap up a few of those characters was at times just too on the nose and I personally am not a fan of how it ended in general, there are just so many inconsistencies and plain errors in the timeline of the movie, that I guess are either going to be ignored or tried to be patched up after the fact.\n\nFantasy only works for suspending reality if they stick to the rules they define for their own universe and Endgame dropped the ball multiple times on this. It's disappointing, that this is how it ends.",
        "It really is a theme park ride. Iron Man movie series was decent but this is just trash.",
        "Worst than Batman VS Superman infinity war is better than this movie, please bring back my money !!!!!",
        "One word for Captain marvel (Booorrring) not worth it to have too much power...\n\nRating By performance and Action...\n\nCaptain America 10/10 My Fav. Iron Man 8/10 Always My Fav. Feel bad for him Thor 7/10 My Greatest superhero Hulk 6/10 Rhody 7/10 Rocket 10/10 My My My Super Fav. Nebula 7/10 Natasha 7/10 Clint 5/10 Ant Man 8/10 Captain Marvel 1/10 ( she didn't deserved to had too much power)\n\nThanos For Infinity War 10/10 Thanos for Endgame 5/10 showing too weak",
        "There is no need of rating and reviews for this amazing movie.Avengers Endgame is the best movie of Marvel cinematic universe (MCU). The movie includes everything! Heart touching ending part. MCU knows audience's expectations very well. No more words to explain... It will double or triple your expectations. Go watch and enjoy..",
        "The movie is fun and entertaining overall. But it is supposed to tie up all the loose ends of the previous films of this franchise, which contradicts with a lot of plots of this particular film. Maybe we should just turn a blind eye and give it a pass because this ending can't be more epic or whatever, but this is the one movie we've waited for so long for me to say like, that's such a great way to tie it up and all. Because it's not. There are so many inconsistencies and cringy moments in this movie. And it doesn't give me the feeling of Infinity War or Cival War. The level of conflict is just not there. So to sum it up, it is kinda enjoyable as a comedy, but I'm personally not satisfied in a whole bunch of ways.",
        "What I like most is the foothold of the whole story: there are no longer long sermons about heroes and responsibilities, but some just want to recover lost things and love in the long river of time. After all, the most moving story is not saving the world, but the meeting and parting between people",
        "Ok, bro.... It's not my favorite movie due to various reasons of writting certain characters, behaviour and death but I. AM. DREANCHED. WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL IM SO SAD THIS MOVIE BROKE ME SO MANY THINGS TO COMMENT I CANT EVEN PROCESS IT RIGHT. JUST WATCH IT, GO WATCH IT.",
        "Such a chore to watch. As unimaginative as film making goes. Could there be some actual humour or even interesting visual ideas or anything? It's just talking heads spouting boring dialogue filmed boringly. Whoa, these have gone bad.",
        "No spoilers, but IMHO it was over produced, over hyped, and way too long. They could easily cut 45 minutes out. I found myself checking my watch to see how long was left, not a good thing. Best description is convoluted. Even though I hope this to be the last Avengers movie, they will find other ways to milk it. I am more of a DC universe fan, though for my hubby I go for him. Not much of an audience reaction either, even though it was sold out. Note to Marcus Theater, how you run out of ice for drinks by 9 pm should be addressed, but on the other hand, 5.00 for soda means more soda for your buck. If you take kids, go early,it's a long 3 hours.",
        "Game of Thrones wins hands down. Even one episode, take episode three series eight as an example.. Note to Russo bros.. see Benioff and Weiss for how to make a an enthralling, gripping, compelling movie..",
        "Disappointing end to a great series where the end just left the viewer deflated and feeling meh. The 3 hour story was very drawn out, maudlin and characters lacked the personalities and substance of the previous movies. The story was also disjointed where it seemed to jump ahead of itself and lacked continuity. The was little or no action and when the big end came it was a few minutes of mediocre fighting flicking to quickly between a few characters. Has to be one of the worst Marvel movies ever and ranks up there with the worst of the Highlander sequels.",
        "No one goes to see a comic book movie expecting to see an art house film. It happens sometimes but it is not the normal. What you expect to see is a fun movie with some philosophical concept and some emotional depth, comic books were never just about the action. So is this a great film? I don't care. Watching it I never stopped to think if there are plot holes or if the cinematography is good, I just enjoyed it. And enjoyed almost everything about it. The Russo brothers are not the new Goddard or the new Bergman (or even the new Spielberg) but they are talented and intellectual people, they had a goal and they delivered by not only doing fan service but also story service. The MCU has a great future.\n\nSo, is it a great film? Comparing it with cinematic masterpieces I could give it a 6-7/10. Comparing it with other blockbuster movies I could give it a 12/10, it's that good...",
        "The movie is not good much as i hoped.I don't know why are these high rates for ? MY GOD Imdb",
        "I am just about to watch this movie for the 5th time and many more after this.. and I just wanted to come on here and maybe hope the makers of this movie sees my review, that I love the MCU movies that lead up to this great ending. Thank you for the awesome stories. It's been one hell of a ride.",
        "He's right. Basically everything he wrote above. The movie was entertaining and well worth the time, but it doesn't deserve a rating higher than decent.\n\nAnd oh.. don't pay for it. Free stream it. NEVER support the greedy milking ****s at Disney corp.",
        "MY GOD!\n\nAfter the jaw dropping cliffhanger Avengers Infinity war left us with, I didn't know how the Marvel films could get any better. But they did.",
        "This movie really is what you would call a cinematic event, seeing as it is the culmination of 10 years of storytelling across several movies ( of varying quality). But Endgame doesn't feel as satisfying as Infinity War or as entertaining as Ultron.\n\nSeeing this in the theater with a cheering crowd was unlike anything I've experienced as people were crazy hype about this one, but outside of the appeal of crossover between characters the film isn't too entertaining.\n\nThe three hour runtime is very much felt (especially on rewatch at home) and there are a lot of scenes that just feel like exposition.\n\nA decent Marvel film all things considered.",
        "This film was hyped so much i couldn't wait to watch it....the film is good but i didnt get the wow factor i had when i watched infinity war.....all the trailers and the online leaks wasted the ending for me....i still love marvel movies and will go see every one that comes out but for me this was good but not as good as I/W",
        "That's it, not even a drop of sense on this one. They completely ruined Thanos Hulk and Thor and after that they dug a hole so deep and had no idea what to do with it. I don't even want to write anymore because the more I think the worse it gets.. they rushed this one too fast. With so many possibilities to do it, it's really sad to end an era like this.",
        "In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.",
        "It's going to be very difficult to top this, and it's also very difficult to express how amazing this film is without spoilers, so I will just keep it brief and say that you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't see this film. It is an epic event in every sense of the word, and you will never forget seeing this movie. The last hout will never leave your memory as long as you live. It is the epitome of action sacrifice and heroism and encapsulates the never ending battle of good versus evil. Go see this movie. See it twice.",
        "I'm a huge fan of long slow-crawl movies (cue LOTR trilogy) but the first half of this culminating slog was way too slow and artificially melodramatic. This is in stark contrast to Infinity War's well edited, if not somewhat fractured fast paced scenes.\n\nIf anything Infinity War could of used an extra 20min of dialogue and slower pacing edited out of Endgame. In the end, still a fun movie but not without obvious pacing flaws.",
        "I'm a lifelong Marvel nerd. I live and breathe Marvel; with that said I'll start my review. The story picks up immediately after Infinity War with Thanos decimating 50% of all life as they try and rectify it. The cast was good though I honestly felt it lacking in conviction besides Tony Stark. The action was lackluster as heck. Endgame is 30 minutes longer then Infinity War and had maybe a fourth of the action runtime that its predecessor had prior. Disappointing battles minus one which lasted all of but a few minutes. The comedy was Endgames only saving salvation to be honest. It pains me to write this because Infinity War was the best superhero movie since sliced bread for a culmination movie. Average at best for me. They should have stopped after Infinity War though I know the comics wouldn't have it. I personally thought it was a cash grab. I'd say watch it once absolutely but don't believe the hype. Endgame makes Age of Ultron look good AF.",
        "I think that this might be even better than infinity war, everyone gets a moment to shine, the ending is spectacular and it might be one of the best films in the Marvel cinematic universe (can't beat guardians of the galaxy though).",
        "With the promos, I thought this would be less epic than Infinity War, but it turned out to be nothing to do with that. I have never had so many mixed feelings with a movie, some decisions are painful, but I think it was good to end the story like that.\n\nEpic, that's it.",
        "Boring, predictable and corny. Thor was the only good thing. Absolute trash",
        "I had a huge disappointment with this movie. I can't share the excitement for this Avengers movie. Sooo much hype and soo much people where excited to see this movie. The Cinema was sold out. But to be really honest it's just simply not worthy to be a Avengers movie. Really flat story and just disappointment how the characters evolved. Sadly that people just will see the \"good comments\" and ignore that this was one of the most disappointing movie ever....",
        "Infinity War was much better. This movie was all over the place and lazy. They reduced Thor and Hulk to an absolute joke.",
        "EXCELLENT BETTER THAN INFINITY WAR !!! BETTER THAN A LOT OF SUPERHERO MOVIES AND IT SEEMS MARVEL WINS !! WHEN ARE THEY MAKING BATMAN VS HULK???? COZ THAT WAS ACTUALLY A COMIC ,,GOOGLE IT !! AND JOACHIN PHOENIX AS THE JOKER IS MAKING ME KINDA HAPPY AND HOPEFUL FOR THE COMIC BOOK ART MOVIES THAT ARE SOMETIMES GREAT LIKE WATCHMEN AND DARK NIGHT and YES TO ENDGAME\n\nSTAN LEE WOULD BE PROUD OF ENDGAME\n\nNUFF SAID",
        "Avengers: Endgame is without a doubt the best Marvel film ever, and my favorite film I've ever seen!!! Amazing from start to finish. Had a very emotional beginning and picks off from there. The actors were all amazing. I loved how unexpecting it was! It was a very beautiful, emotional, and satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga. It ended the character's story in a marvelous way, and I wouldn't have changed anything about it. This movie does not disappoint!!! Thank you Marvel for making this masterpiece a reality!!!",
        "Wow , first time to stay 3 hours long in the cinema . It's quite an experience in IMAX with laser . Movie is alright , just like what i expected . But 50 USD worth ticket per one is insane !",
        "Ok so, starting off I will admit I have never been huge into the MCU. But goddamn this movie was amazing. Hands down the best fight scene I've ever seen in a non animated film to date. And so far the only action movie to bring me to tears.",
        "Yes, you heard it right. It was very badly written. Like the time-travel system is so weird. They tried to be unique with it but failed.",

        "I mean y'know, they did a good job, but plot is a little boring. definitely not worth 3 hours. overall decent movie",
        "It wasn't bad, bu it's a simple action cliche, with humor, without drama or deep message. What special about infinity war, is the conflict. The villain is not all evil. He wants to create a better world for everyone to thrive. Infinity war ends with a dissonance, and many viewers, me included asked themselves - maybe he is right. Endgame starts with a simple answer - the world is a mess after Thanos actions. I think the world can thrive even with half of the population, but here right from the beginning the answer is simple. Endgame switched from the attempt to make the bad guy have deep character, into a clear message: \"Thanos is all bad\". Well this message continues through the entire movie, and I hate the fact they ruined the deep complex villain character, with a \"want to destroy all, including his comrades \" boring villain.",
        "My first ever review - i went to this in theaters because I heard the hype and had one co worker tell me he thought it was a '9.2' out of 10.\n\nCompared to the first this was wildly mediocre. Overall an okay film but I was honestly very excited for it to be over after three hours. They could have done much better.",
        "This time I m speech less best movie of the year and so emotional comedy and some out of action this is snap of fingers",

        "The movie was made for only two things, the first eliminate all the old actors with a supposedly amazing end, that is just Fan service. And the other fact is that Marvel just wanted to make money however they could do something more impression.\n\nI have to admit that the special effects were fantastic and the movie was really funny to watch.",
        "Avengers Endgame Review Score - 10/10 Avengers Endgame could be well described as the most complicated storyline in the entire Marvel history not only because it had to wrap up a story of eleven years but also because of the complex solution to an inevitable situation that The Avengers try to achieve with the avenging not being the major part of the story. The three hour runtime was well utilized by giving more time to establish the characters' humanistic attachments and the losses they suffered; not only in this movie, but from the very moment they've been incepted into this franchise. Unlike the previous outings, the characters differ in their choices and these contrasts in their choices lead up to one massive and satisfying final battle which may not end the entire MCU, but certainly does end a glorious era of the long franchise. The entire movie, especially the final battle was a huge fan service as it included everything a Marvel fan could possibly dream of. PS: There is no Post - Credits Scene in the film, but it is worth waiting for the entire credits to roll.",
        "Avengers endgame one of the most anticipated movies of 2019 was watchable. The story was way too predictable except the ending. Movie contains some of the best VFX graphics well it's Marvel. The performances of the actors is also very brilliant. MCU fans won't want to miss it.",

        "This is my own opinion, but so many things that didn't make sense in that movie... like so much stuff that could've been utilised in a better way and so many stupid things that were put on wrong hands. The image and the graphics are really good but the plot is weak. Emotionally I give a 9/10 Graphics I give a 9/10 Storyline I give a 3/10",
        "I tried to rewatch this pathetic movie 3 times. 1st time from the very beginning, 2nd time from 30th minutes, 3d time from 60th minute. With the same result: the film was just boring. Waste of time.",
        "I really did. The writers just continued to made changes to characters that were convenient for their story. Just like in Infinity War. And why such a spotlight on a single character, while others are barely seen in the movie. Too many plot holes, inconsistencies, and overall character changes. Disappointed :(",
        "Wow, just Wow! This movie has it all and needs to be watched PERIOD!!",
        "I cried and laughed and blah, blah, blah. CGI was great, but I can't get past all the subtext to create plot rules and then completley blow them put of the water. I can think of about 5 minutes of scenes and a slightly different way to handle the last moments of the battle that would have covered those holes. I can't believe no one said \"Hang on a minute. This wont work.\"",

        "The movie seems to be dragged. If you're going in with an expectation that it will contain lots of action, you'll be disappointed. Few major characters have been watered down in significance as well. Overall decent movie, but won't watch it again. If you're going in with an expectation of \"Dark Knight, Interstellar, Inception, Logan\" level movie, then don't. You'll end up disappointed.",
        "It missed some feather for thor. Maybe a cooking scene with Hulk. Would like to see a shower scene but just for the bubbles not for the actors. No really... was it a joke. Didn't get the buzz for this crap. Not so innocent as it seemed in its poor hidden messages anticipating the future makeover of the Marvel universe... and it's fall. Sign me out.",
        "This movie was complicated and weird. The child friendly Barney/Thanos started attacking random hero's like iron man and other people. I found this very odd because Barney teaches us to have fun but he is ending other people's fun. This was complicated because they kept on referring to Barney as Thanos which made it difficult to understand what was happening.",
        "I was expecting this movie for a long time and i was sure that since the last 3 avengers movies were good ,that this one will be the best , they even compared it to dark knight... but no, itt wasn't. The flow of the movie was very slow and uneven, 2 whole hours introduction for 30min of action and suspnce.. when the action finaly came i couldnt even be excited.They tried to create emotions, but you can't force that ,when yoou devote your 2 first hours to nothing. It has soem great scenes and it wasn't so awful but i excpected much more from the closing movie of avengers with not so many plot holes...",
        "When the plot and storyline is weak, movie makers rrsort to great publicity. This is precisely what Endgame is all about. No fizz just gas.",
        "This movie could of easily been 2 hours. Cant believe how close I was to falling asleep during it. Yes are there a few good actions, sure are. But there is too much stalling and 'build up\" between. There were already 22 films for build up. Enough with the fore play. It was time for a the pay off and sadly they dropped the ball.",
        "O melhor filme de todos os tempos misturando drama,humor e a\u00e7\u00e3o de uma forma perfeita com o melhor final de todos os tempos.",
        "Marvel let us down this time for real bad film bad jokes",
        "I did not expect to see in my life such a faithful rendition of my childhood heroes from the comics to the big screen ... the emotions was huge ... the only reason I kept and did not cry in the cinema was because I was shy not to see me ... . From Athens Greece Thank you STAN LEE for filling my childhood with those fantastic stories and heroes ,also Russo and marvel because you have respected our comic heroes on the big screen ... my only sadness is that we could not see avengers together with XMEN- fantastic four -Daredevil in the same movie, but you can not have it all at life",
        "Boring, non-sense, crowd pleaser. All the good things made in IW were destroyed here.",
        "I had a heck of a time watching this movie. I usually like the Marvel films, but this one seems to fall in the pattern that I see way too often these days. At three hours, it is way too long. There is just not enough happening that is capable of sustaining interest in a 3 hour movie. Sometimes, less is more.",
        "A colossal conclusion, a proper ending for an epic saga. It brought you to the beginning, it remind you of all the years you have invested. Then boom, here is that dessert that make you overwhelmed and craved at the same time. It closed one door to open up another, there is still a new journey ahead of us. Great execution by Joe and Anthony Russo!",
        "If you like Iron man, Captain America or Thor do not watch this movie! Marvel has ruined everything....They will probably lose millions of fans... I will never see any of their movies anymore.",
        "Man. Be cynical about the plethora of superhero movies all you want, but it really all came together.",
        "I wait this film without any patience. I hope that it would be one of the greatest film of MCU. My hope became the truth. In me point of view, this film is great from all aspects of cinema. Firstly, the story is amazing, the screenwriters did the great work, despite of 3 hours, no moments looks very long or boring. Twisted moments happen in the right place, most of actions of characters are logical. The authors have big attention to little details and \"easters\" due the film. Secondly, the cast is awesome, so many characters of comics together were the first time in the history. Some characters' lines ends, and this finish looks great (Iron Man and Captain America). Thirdly, the visual effects is wonderful. So, it's one of greatest oan biggest film ever.",
        "It's a masterpiece! Fight, acting, storyline , everything perfect.",
        "Best movie ever created even . Storyline was awesome and animation was spectacular. I think the rock-heart inhumans are disliking this movie and mr/ms hate I know your life can just spread hate so it's ok some inhumans are in the world. It's also the 2 most earned movie of over 2 billion dollars so they have earned what they wanted and gained love from all mcu and rest . So , joke on you mr/ms hate.",
        "I think every comic book character is included in this mess of a movie.\n\nThey do a lot of CGI fighting and emoting in front of a green screen.\n\nSome bad guys get vanquished. Good guys make some quips.\n\nDateless 14 year old boys get a fun night out at the Googleplex. Girls stay home and study for mid-terms because they're our future engineers and doctors.\n\nScarlett Johannsen looks terrible as a ginger, by the way.",
        "Wanted to love this movie. I really did.\n\nAll the Marvel movies have been great the last few years. Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther were superb. Infinity War was spectacular. Endgame was disappointing.\n\nShame.",
        "I've watched it multiple times and I love it more every time!",
        "Josh brolin is a remarkable thanos. He captured the character very well . The emotions , expressions and most of all being the villain in the MCU",
        "I watched it today, it's wasn't the best film but it is the things of emotional, 10 years since IRON MAN 1 released.",
        "To do what marvel has done over the course of 22 films is near impossible and to end that in an epic film?! Wow, that needs appreciation.\n\nTo the people saying that the time travel is an insult to real time travel movies, come-on listen to yourself, no one has done time travel so no one knows how it will effect, wake up from your hate world and see it for what it is. I get what you are doing, seeing a film so highly rated because you don't rate it that high so you want to lower the overall rating, thus the 1 stars. Well good luck to you all.",
        "It just shows the influence of media and the hype on the popularity of a movie. It was the first time, that I fell asleep watching a film in the cinema. It doesn't deserve to be among the top 250 movies of all time.",
        "A wonderful and amazing movie for all the fans. So much emotions, so many nostalgic moments, and action, humor, drama! We get to see all the superheroes and some more loveable characters. I feel sorry for those who try to find scientific logic in a movie about superheros. You really need to focus on what's important. Just enjoy!",
        "Pretty cheesey and fake. Stupid spandex outfits. Movie should have been about 5 min long it would have been easier to watch",
        "Positives:\nDirecting, script and cinematography\nMain cast\nAction scenes\nMost of the humor\nScope\nIt was a perfect conclusion for 22 movies in 11 years\n\n\nNegatives:\nNot much",
        "Absolutely perfect conclusion of 10 years of MCU and the excellent ending of Avenger. Don't read reviews, not even spoiler free one. Go see it you won't Regret it! 10 on 10!",
        "First of all infinity war was much better and the only reason this made it to the top is that it's like a kids film the fightings are so childish, it doesn't have the vibe that marvel comics give you and as you know this movie has the most sells only why? Because they released this movie twice second time they said they added ten minutes and the ten minutes was mostly the credits cheap strategy but it worked on MARVEL FANBOYS.",
        "After what happened in Infinity war, the only question I had was \"how can they top that?\" That question was answered, no other superhero movie will be able to beat Endgame. The movie just gets better and better and the huge finale is done spectacularly and has everything you want to see and much, much more. The set up for this was perfect, the build up to this was perfect, and the pay off was perfect. Avengers: Endgame is done flawlessly and perfectly.",
        "I don't wanna spoil anything but god damn ..this was amazing, funny, dramatic, sad, action packed...everything about it was just perfect.. The 3 hours went by like they were nothing. And im gonna go watch it again on Friday because this was a emotion roller coaster and i need more of if.",
        "Idk if this deletes the previous review but I'll try.",
        "When my brother and I watched the film, it blew our minds away. Great fight scenes and of course the humor. I want to watch it again and experience the moment. Josh Brolin was excellent playing Thanos. This is the top #1 film in the box office and in cinema history. I hope this film will win an academy award for the 2020 Oscars. Loved it and enjoyed it! MARVEL RULES!!! EXCELSIOR!!!",
        "A perfect way to end the avengers saga. This movie will have you feeling all your emotions. Totally worth the 10 years of movies and the 3 hour play screen",
        "It's great Avengers finally beat Thanos, iron man took 6 infinity stones from Thanos and flipped the fingers, Thanos became dust left away, but for the whole movie totally no need 181 minutes, I want to say 60% of the part is nonsense and boring, doesn't relate to the plot\n\nNot worth for 181 minutes, I think only took 90min for the movie that's all",
        "I hope everyone appreciates this movie for the piece of art it is. Everything that has happened in the MCU (22 movies) mattered. This movie blended all of the storylines into one arc beautifully. It has a perfect blend of drama and well timed comedic moments. Every character has a chance to shine and the cast delivered at every chance. It has a perfect ending. Of course the Disney/marvel machine will roll on. They are printing money at this point. But let's all take a while and appreciate the work of the entire team that made this happen for fans. I grew up wondering if I'd ever see this material on a big screen. I feel like a kid watching these movies and I'll always love them for that.\n\nSo please, avoid the spoilers and see this for yourself. Enjoy it now and forever.",
        "Find superhero. Superhero doesn't want to get involved. Talk to superhero until they do want to get involved. Repeat. Endgame has its moments, but it's way too bloated for its own good.",
        "If you're a fan of the MCU, this movie most likely maxes out at about an 8/10. If you're a fan of superhero movies, this movie is not for you. Slow drama scenes fill the better part of a very long run time, leading to a 3 hour long superhero movie with only a handful of fight scenes and minimal action.\n\nRather predictable for the most part. Very hit-or-miss: either a dream come true or quite mediocre. For the \"movie of the century\", it sure was a let down, that's for sure.",
        "Just watched the new Avengers-movie. It's simply fantastic and a must-watch for every Marvel-Fan. It contains everything I expected and wished for an so much more. It's hard to put in words without a spoiler. Find out by yourself and enjoy.",
        "IW was way better, this movie did not deliver, I actually even preferred Capt Marvel.",
        "There are very few movies that achieve the closure, the feeling and the success that this movie did. I honestly can make out 3000+ reasons why this movie is so great, but most guys have. This movie is serious, light-hearted, funny, packed with action... It delivered every emotion possible to the viewer, only to later build on it with another, and that without reducing the importance of it's previous scenes. It managed to finalise every previous movie of the MCU, give meaning and importance to all of them, and reward it's viewer with (what I personally thought was) the BEST cinema experience of my life. Having said that, this review is 9/10 just because i feel Infinity War is a better movie, and that Endgame can't stand-alone. But it wasn't supposed to. ;)",
        "I'm big fan of marvel, and I see all movie comics books and this is a best movie in the world not only comics , in all movies.",
        "Going through the past scenes is a great review of Marvel's 11 years of film history. Both feelings and laughter can fully enjoy every detail or forgotten. When the lost comrades gathered up the All-Star team again, all the foreshadowing broke out with emotion at this moment. In those days, the six member team now has thousands of troops, and it is a miracle to go to this stage. Two pillars and two curtain calls mark the end of an era",
        "I was shocked, I seriously expected the worst for this movie and even held off watching it for ages after it came out because people just said it was so poorly done but in reality it was quite spectacular, for me anyway. I'm content with how this movie went and ended.",
        "The best marvel movie ever, I cannot put into words how amazing this movie was, too good!",
        "This movie was so bad they had to screw up on the hulk worse than infinity war",
        "This is the best movie i watch in my life. Everybody do their best. Direction was good.",
        "I watched this movie when it come out and was so happy bla bla bla but after some time and the second viewing it's not that good honestly. It's a kids movie and marvel has become that! None of the jokes really hit the mark and it just straight up didn't age well for me",
        "After watching the premiere tonight, this movie is the best one I have ever seen, Better than Dark Knight. The laughter is on another level with some serious cry because we are in the endgame now, it is expected. The way they have assembled all the 21 movies in 1 epic 3 hour screenplay is completely mind blowing and astonishing. The Russo brothers are pure epitome of perfection to showcase MCU at its best. Thank you MARVEL STUDIOS and STAN LEE for giving us such epicness. Some might not like it, might not remember about it but not us - is what I will tell myself even after 10 more years.",
        "Well, \"Avengers: Endgame\" was quite a movie. Full of action, loads of CGI {Too much to fully take in}, and an interesting storyline; It certainly was \"crunch time\". I did actually enjoy this movie, although not as much as the previous instalment. \"Endgame\" is however a decent film, full of twists and turns, and now Marvel has matured, the end is an emotional farewell. Great film, enjoy.",
        "This movie was incredible, it did everything I wanted it to do and every character had their time to shine, the film was the culmination of 22 MCU films and ten years of buildup and the film pulled it off beautifully. This film could have turned out as a mess if it was in the wrong hands, but the Russo brothers have masterfully pulled off an awesome and emotionally satisfying finale to the Avengers franchise and MCU series even though we are getting more films with \"Spider-Man: A Long Way From Home\" coming out later this year\n\nOverall, the film was everything it needed to be and the hefty 3 hour run time was definitely more than necessary. The film did everything I expected and much much more, closing a chapter on pop culture history and a franchise loved by billions, it was as close to perfect as a film like this can get",
        "This motion picture is epic in scale, visually stunning, entertaining from start to finish and is the definition of why we love superhero movies.",
        "The movie is \"okay\", but can\u00b4t reach the same intensity like Avengers: Infinity War. Sadly to say, that the production team missed the opportunity to deliver a milestone in superhero cinema. The effects and the shooting is top notch, but unfortunately that\u00b4s not all. It just looked like \"work on schedule\". So, don\u00b4t believe the media hype and don\u00b4t set your expectations too high. Entertaining? Yes... somehow if you forget about all the cringy moments! But really nothing more...",
        "Endgame and Infinity War are pretty much on the same level in terms of entertainment. And that level is not very high. Look, there's no magic. The first Avengers movie had it along with many of the other firsts in the group. But that magic has gone away. First off, please don't hit us over the head with the emotion hammer. You did this by trying to lengthen out shots where characters look into the distance... for 10 seconds OR look at each other and hug 5 times. What was 3hrs could have been easily 2.5hrs with a little slice of that here or there. Overall, you're seeing the film for the characters you love... you're almost forced to if you're a comic book fan. If you're not a fan - don't bother.",
        "What a monumental movie & wonderful closure for a 11yrs Odyssey that is gonna be remembered as a legendary achievement on a cinematic standpoint. It is a magnificent love letter to all these emblematic characters & for us all, passionate fans of these universes.",
        "\"After the years of a big buildup what a big let down . There was plot hole after plot hole and little action scenes. Thanos was like a little girl in comparison to infinity war . Captain Marvel one of the most powerful in the galaxy was on annual leave only there for little bits . The Hulk was a disappointment. Thoese rating a high score are just not watching the movie at all .\"\n\nI have to agree with this statement, plot holes all over the movie.. but in the other hand if you like a visual appealing movie and you are a Tony Stark/Iron Man fan well i guess its not a completly waste.\n\nIn other words, I wouldnt pay to see it again.",
        "If I hadn't grown up in the silver age of Marvel, if I hadn't worshipped the stories Stan wrote and the pictures Jack drew, if these iconic characters hadn't been modernised for a new generation with shorter attention spans and a need for 'comic' interludes, I'd have scored this higher. It's good. But I hate the lame humour and the modern take. Having said that, I enjoyed the film.",
        "There are just far too many inconsistencies and questions with this film to mention here. Suffice it to say that there is something seriously wrong when a minor character such as Nebula gets something like 60 minutes of screen time and characters such as Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, Spiderman, Black Panther, Winter Soldier and others appear for maybe 5 minutes...",
        "Take three hours to say goodbye. It's assembly, it's reunion, it's farewell, it's sacrifice. As the final installment in the series, it has certainly done its best, with laughs, tears and flashes. This generation is over. See you next generation!",
        "This truly was worth every second of wait. I first seen it on the midnight screening. I must have watched it 5 times since and I cry every single time lol. Cracking end to a fab set of movies.",
        "Endgame is an amazing culmination of 11 years of Marvel movies, leading to an epic battle. The acting, CGI, and plot are on point. It was also great to have references from previous movies, showing that all of the MCU is connected.\n\nI fully recommend, but do watch the previous movies to understand context, characters, and the story in general.",
        "And some parts brought me to tears. The cast was phenomenal and I think every superhero got to have their spotlight.",
        "I didn't think this could surpass Infinity War but the Russo Brothers did it. Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame managed to do it. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and I'll go so far as to say, maybe even the absolute pinnacle of the Marvel franchise. It's both hilarious and emotionally engaging (there were people crying at my theatre including me). And while it's a lot more character focused than Infinity War, as it should be considering this is the final hurrah for many of the original Avengers, that doesn't mean it's lacking In terms of visuals. The film is an absolute spectacle to behold, it easily tops Infinity War's action sequences in my opinion and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated.\n\n10/10 best Marvel movie in my opinion. It's honestly hard for me to see how they'll ever be able to top this one.",
        "Best marvel film to come out to this date. It is extraordinary, mind boggling, you will definitely get lots of goosebumps. 10/10 for sure. The culmination of the last 11 years of Marvel movies has lead to this epic conclusion of the pinnacle of the infinity saga. The movie defied all odds and absolutely crushed it out of the park. Brimmed with emotions and swashbuckling fiesta. Avengers: Endgame delivers.",
        "No spoilers here. 22 movies, 11 years, and multiple story arcs to tie together. A MASSIVE and record breaking task. Not only that, but I was expecting a lot and got MORE than what I expected. Infinity war was incomplete (on purpose). Unfortunately it just didn't feel like a complete story. This movie is a complete story in and of itself, and it ties in well. More action, more acting, good humor, and TIME TRAVEL!! Also, no credit scenes. This is the end of the current Avengers saga as we know it. Expect teasers for the next team, but don't expect any hints of the next saga's story.",
        "It was always going to be a challenge to create a movie that neatly ties up a decade of continuity and juggles a cast of characters built up over 22 films and the fear was that End Game was going to be anticlimactic. Fans do not fear, the Russo's have crafted a near perfect film from its heart wrenching opening to its close. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll weep and you'll leave the cinema pretty happy with the experience. If you are new to the Marvel Universe then this is not for you and will appear to be a jumbled mess of a film but for anyone who has been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Iron Man back in 2008 this is everything you wanted to see.",
        "It's good I really do think that it's good but people over huped it",
        "The way they did the time travel makes things a lot confusing. Captain Marvel was too powerful. Thanos could have also used the infinity gems during the fight. The part were everything exploded, come on somebody should have died there.",
        "I would have been happy if \"Infinity War\" had been the last installment. Let viewers decide if Thanos was right or wrong. Give us some credit. It may be a comic book franchise, but it was a semi-smart one. Was. Too long, too light on plot, and not engaging at all. 3 hours of my life I'm not getting back...",
        "I want to give it 7/10 but +1 just for the potential of film makers who could present this conclusion.\n\nIW was just too perfect. Endgame must have been on the top of it, but sadly it is not.\n\nDespite of the difficulty to continue with the storyline after thanos' snap, this end is satisfactory.\n\nI think film makers should have taken one more part of Avengers to bring down the conclusion. This way they could bring more action to it.",
        "Basically the title. Left me speechless. I was probably too hyped to the point of annoyance but it broke my massive expectations to the point that I'm watching it again 2 more times this weekend. It leaves you at the edge of your seat and the 3rd act is just insane and a masterpiece. Infinity War was fantastic but this is insanity, in all the right ways. The best series finale that I hoped it would be and then some.",
        "Worst film in MCU so far! Totally missed the expectations after Avengers:Infinity War was so great.",
        "Although the movie was 3 hours long, no one was willing to leave halfway through. In the early hours of the premiere, the cinema was still crowded, and everyone was waiting for the end. We know that the mission of heroes is to save the world, and even to give up their families, lovers, children, friends. Goodbye my Stark, goodbye my Natasha.",
        "So unfair to the Thor's character. I felt the character was totally treated bad. Even the Hulk's character was wasted.",
        "Just amazing,just surreal,just mind blowing,just satisfying. This is one of my favorite mcu movies and I waited this long to write this review just to see how impactful it is. And yeah it is very impactful, the effort of this movie to climax over ten years of meticulous planning of family friendly movies is just phenomenal. The cast did a remarkable job.",
        "A fitting way to launch the next phase of the Marvel Universe, so satisfying and the 3 hours disappeared in a blink of an eye. Will definitely watch again in general release.",
        "I really like this movie, I found a good plot and also a good final, yeah the people cry and more, but it is a serious movie with several elements which honored to its fans, It is indeed a super hero movie that will live in th mind of many fans",
        "This is an above average movie. I recommend you see it in theatres, but don't get your hopes up as far as it being an amazing experience. If you have a good crowd then it will definitely help in your experience!",
        "Movie is full of action, but even for that I wait last 30 min when the movie Will be over, cause it didn't have hype to keep me exciting. Characters are great written. Some Characters as Thor and Hulk are much different that we been seen them before. Fight scenes and acting are better in Infinity war.For example:when Thor come in Wakanda in Infinity war. Story line is great, but have some gaps. In this movie Cap. American and Iron man are in front plan. In this movie Thor is so so different and almost act like a girl. This is to big turn over for such musculine and strongest character of all Avengers.on moment it looks like this is Cap America or Iron man movie. I expect much more after media advertising.",
        "I can understand the feeling of MCU fans but the movie didn't have the impact, as IW. I didn't expect IW to be a good movie, so I had high hopes from Endgame, but it didn't turn out to be that great. Acting was spot on, but felt draggy in between with jokes here and there. War sequence was rushed, there wasn't any wow factor in during that scene. Ending was fine. Ye fans would love it.",
        "Best Avengers & MCU movie ever.This is a crossover that you will remember forget.The visual effects,fighting scene everything was awesome.",
        "I enjoyed watching the previous ones.Now this one is too long, 3 Hrs.",
        "I would say the MCU has been perfectly executed and Avengers Endgame provided the prefect closure for the Infinity Saga. Can't wait for what MCU brings to the plate next!",
        "As generic and cookie cutter and dull and boring as 'movies' can possibly be... I love how all the overgrown, second adolescence/ immature 'adults' talk about how 'moved' they are by this kind of garbage. It's fine for kids. Adults are just dumb for liking rubbish like this... This bores me to tears...",
        "Like WTH?!! The movies went on a downward spiral eversince ragnarok. Can't say how disappointing it was.",
        "I really waited for this movie a whole year and when I watch it for the first time I was really emotional and it is really a nice tribute for the original six and a perfect ending to this past 10 years. I really enjoyed the experience, and I am waiting for more from Marvel and I am excited to see what will they do with these characters.",
        "This movie was build up since 2008. This has been one of the best MCU moments they ever shown. Not only this Movie was epic,but also emotional as well. This movie shown what is like to have an emotional roller coaster journey.Amazing conclusion to an epic journey.A fitting climax that takes infinity war to another level.I am Already planning to see it again.This is the movie that Marvel fans deserved.",
        "I need to see this movie again. When I saw it, I just felt so satisfied. It was like waiting for your turn to open a present and when the movie started, I got a great gift. Now, I agree with the notion that Infinity War is a better movie overall. But if I were to choose between Infinity War and Endgame, I'm choosing the latter because I just loved it that much. The first few scenes are just hard-hitting. And then there's a five-year skip and it's really sad. You almost feel empty which is how our heroes feel. But eventually, it gives you a feeling of excitement and hope; everything might be okay. And then there's a battle and something is sacrificed. And it's sad again. Then later on, there's another sacrifice. And now it's depressing. But, in the end, something good happens, and you're getting hopeful again. Hopeful for the future. Which is why this movie is important to me. I'm sorry if you don't find it helpful, I was trying avoid spoilers. And if you didn't like the movie, that's alright; you don't have to. Just remember to let others enjoy it.",
        "Some people said there's so few fights scenes and it's boring. But if you watch MCU whole, you know what is this all about\n\nMovie is just iconic. I remember how strong my heart was beating in the final battle. Everyone who worked on this movie did best they can. I gave only 4-5 movies 10 stars , and Endgame absolutely deserves it.",
        "Great conclusion to this part of the MCU. The only thing I wasn't a fan with was how long the movie was. I remember walking out of the movie theatre thinking it's been like an entire day! But yeah it was amazing! 9/10 I love you 3000 \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude2d",
        "The movie deserves to be a cinematic masterpiece, great!!!",
        "I would like to start by saying I'm a huge MCU fan. I completely get why people love this movie! it's a fun, end to a adventure that has been a part of many peoples lives for a long span of time. It is a great movie however it escapes me how people can watch this movie and not see huge flaws with the it. The best thing I can say is stuff just doesn't make sense.\n\n*Stuff in shots that isn't there in the next shot. *Simple story explanations were not present. *overall the story felt bland actually.\n\nWith that said, overall you will have a good time watching the movie.",
        "If I could go back in time, I would not watch the Avengers End Game. If I could go back in time, I would stop 20 minutes before the ending of Infinity War as well. This is a good example of a mediocre script. The production values are excellent, but that is the expectation of any movie.",
        "Loved it Loved it Loved it Loved it Tony we love you 3000.......",
        "A bit disappointed. There is something missing. It's a good tribute to the mceu, but not a very good story.",
        "Best marvel movie ever, conclusion of the 21 marvel movies don't think much just go for it \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc9f\ud83d\udc9f",
        "It is hard to end a story especially with as many characters as the MCU so I came in expecting a weaker movie than Infinity War. The story ends appropriately for the main characters and they do have some satisfying character moments. The major battle scene was too hard to follow since there were too many characters in an environment that is already visually busy.\n\nOverall a good conclusion to the story.\n\nCould it have been better? Yes, but the same can be said about most other movies.",
        "Because dc fans are jealous and taking s.h.i.t without even watching it.",
        "The film starts to fall apart the more you think about it, but the conclusion to so many wonderful decade-spanning character arcs are so incredibly satisfying. There's so much to like about this film.",
        "One or if not the best Superhero movies ever made , breathtaking visuals and on the edge of your seat action.",
        "This film is all about CGI effects and animation. 0% mind blowing. 80% nonsense science 20% jokes",
        "Maybe because I\u00b4m an \"over 50 year old European\" (when I look at the votes) but I don\u00b4t get it. A cast filled with big names of which have very good resumes. But this movie gives me the idea: Let\u00b4s push 1 more out \"for the team\". A team that seems to be growing with extra superheroes with every sequel.\n\nNot a movie I would watch alone, nor with my children who are 27 and 29 years of age. Maybe in 10 years time with my grandchildren but than it\u00b4s prolly outdated, like I might be atm. But these cash cow movies don\u00b4t do it for me anymore.",
        "One of the top boring superhero films! 3hrs of runtime makes no sense w/ all drama & the action part being not more than 30min.... Not worthy to watch again!",
        "The movie is entertaining and time will fly faster than expected as you're in it. On any standard I do recommend the movie if not for anything else, but for it's entertainment value. I do believe the hype that is going on around the movie will be letting some people down.\n\nI'm in between giving it a 6 or 7 because of the well executed entertainment value it provides. I will have to round it down to 6 because of the amount of 10's this movie is getting at the moment. The movie neither blows your brains with plot twists or anything like that.\n\nComparing this purely to other superhero movies I'd give this one a 9-. I think Infinity Wars was better, but this concludes the Avenger series perfectly.",
        "Entertaining movie. Mostly just fan service and weird plot holes. Go watch it. You've invested 10 years now. It's funny",
        "I don't know why people are calling it the best Marvel movie till date. Come on guys did you not watched infinity war. To be honest, that was the greatest movie and this was no way near that. It has so many loopholes and extra scenes, I don't know what Russo brothers were thinking. It got lucky just because of all the buildup that the previous movies made, otherwise it would have end up just like justice league.",
        "I liked it when it came out and I still like it. It became better for me when I rewatched it.",
        "This film is RI-DI-CULOUS! It's 99% self oriented on men great old hero's Iron Man (poor martyr), captain America, the Archer and Banner. So many drama scenes boring. No place with such testosterone for Captain Marvel, 5min on 2H. People don't waist your money!",
        "This is the best finale to a saga. There are infinite cool references from the start to the end through dialogues, music, costume, sets, e.t.c. The time traveling sequence was clever and so was the intial first hour which dwells on the emotional complexity of the characters. The final hour battle was intentionally fast paced and rushed for targeting multiple viewings. There is no more scene in the history of cinema more classy and massy than portals.",
        "It was a fitting end to Marvel's 11 year plan. The only thing I had a problem with was the confusing time travel. I'm excited for the next phase of Marvel.",
        "Quite simply, this is the most overrated film of all time. There was such a great hype about the film and it is rated a strong 8.5. My rating of 1 star is not right and I would give it a 3 or 4, but I feel it had to get 1 to try and level out this scandalous rating it has.\n\nFrankly the plot is unimaginative and poor and the logic used hapless. It just goes to show that they could produce any film, and as long as it has Iron Man and Co in it, then it will get a good rating.",
        "It seems arbitrary to review a movie like this. It's not a movie it's a journey. I watched MCU movies over 5 years before this and it is a great conclusion. I can't say you'll love it and it's easy to nitpick but its good. Seeing it in the theater was an experience I will never get again. Sincerely recommended.",
        "This movie is the best marvel have ever made.\n\nA 3 hour masterpiece , don't read the reviews just go see it .",
        "After infinity war I really had very high hopes from this. Bit disappointed-",
        "One of the best movie I ever watched.\n\nA must watch for all the Marvel fans. Full of action & emotions.",
        "Never in my life have I left a review on here however I felt obligated to after sitting through three hours of absolute nonsense. The film began an I was just at a loss for words, it felt like a practical joke. However I held out hope that it would get better, it didn't, it got worse. The way some of these beloved characters have been portrayed in this film literally made my toes curl up in embarrassment, it's absolutely shocking. Lazy writing, and beyond anti climactic. I've seen so many 10/10 reviews on here I'm half convinced the film I seen was actually a joke and all these other people got to see a completely different film than I did. I had so much hope for the Russo Brothers to make this a truly spectacular film and I didn't think it would be possible for them to mess up this bad. I had tickets to go and see it a second time later on today however I'd rather lose the money and not go than sit through it again. So dissappointed.",
        "Without a doubt, that's a movie which visuals are stunning as always. That does not disappoint. My main concerns are with the story, some unbelievable situations and battles. The results are not always what you expect, which IMO lowers the rating.\n\nIt would be a better movie, if the seriousness of situations was increased throughout and the whole current of the movie was based on more active, wild and shocking battles.",
        "This movie was actually good and enjoyable, i could say this movie has plot holes as and the middle part of the movie was pretty boring, mostly because the middle part didn't feel like avengers, but i gotta say that the beginning and and the ending was the best parts, i could watch this movie as many times i want, but to compare this to infinity war, infinity war wins in my opinion, because this one starts slow, i do recommend this but it had some flaws",
        "I was expecting something much better. The movie is way too long, it has a lot of unnecessary scenes. Some parts were actually boring. Captain Marvel is really annoying.",
        "The storytelling is obviously inspired by unserious \"fun\" episodes or specials for TV, with its lack of real drama or any kind of directorial sophistication, just simple problem solving and casual action. Based on that, I can understand why people give this movie such a crazy-good rating. Its production values are truly monumental, or rather, the computing power is truly impressive, and the studio did good work.\n\nBut being what it is, I still can't rate it higher than average.",
        "Excellent hype for non Marvel fans, the plot just develops too slowly for those who have actually been following the entire sage. Flat performances by all actors, Antman being the stand out this time around. Expected a huge gripping finale but was presented with an overly confident view on everything and no suspense whatsoever. Chuckled a coupe of times but couldn't wait to leave the cinema. Will wait for the next Installment.....",
        "Every time I watch this movie, I'm reminded of how amazing it is. The action, the characters are all great. It's truly the EndGame.",
        "EndGame is an epic finale to one of the greatest infinity saga. God the movie is fantastic!!! I laughed, i cried and i cheered for the movie. I wont write much or spoilers would come out of my mouth. Its all what marvel fans have been waiting for. I will write another review after Monday so that my review can be filled with Spoilers!!!",
        "After disappointment with both infinity war which on 2nd viewing wasn't as bad as I remembered either and also captain marvel it was a mixture of nerves and hope they could cap it off properly and boy did they deliver the best 3 hours of film I can remember that absolutely flew by. The perfect ending to a largely amazing set of films. A truly mind blowing experience.",
        "Only 1 word for this movie. WOW. This is so spectacular and great movie.",
        "Nothing more to say. This movie was the greatest. It skittle have never been knocked off the number 1 ranking money maker.",
        "I mean what is there to say other than wow this movie is just incredible. WOW",
        "Good movie, but the previous one was better.\n\nIt was enjoyable but not as exciting as the one before.",
        "I give 8 for this film, need more fighting scenesssss, 3 hours like 1 hours :) but it's ok.",
        "I Had high expectations after seeing avengers infinity war and i must say that i'm not disappointed at all. They kicked it up a notch, not with more action but with a heartfelt story. Hats of to Kevin feige and the russo brothers.",
        "To me Endgame is not the absolute perfect movie but sure as hell is the perfect ending to a great arc Don't think they could have made a better movie Great job Love watching it as a marathon with Infinity War makes it even better.",
        "Thank you Russo brothers! Thank you for living up the dream of every Marvel fans! I am not sure if there will be a better movie than this in the upcoming years. But this has got to be the best superhero comic movie ever made! If you are hyped with all this reviews coming in, you have another thing coming your way. Stop whatever you are doing and do whatever it takes to the watch this epic movie of the year! A finale well written and a movie worth every penny of your money. Bring your kids, family, friends and have the best 3 hours of your life like i did. We were never ready for this. We never did.... #WhateverItTakes #Endgame",
        "This movie is incredible in every way.....\n\nAVENGERS ASSEMBLE.",
        "From the beginning to end the characters are very alive and at the beginning we never going to believe that is gonna happened but it does and after that the movie been a roller coaster and the climax is the generator of goosebumps and at end for me its a pain to dilute the truth. Over all its an perfect ending to the greatest franchise in marvel universe.",
        "It is awesome, fantastic, but it was not as great as infinity war",
        "It's hard to put into words my feelings after seeing this film. Endgame is an epic, unpredictable, and emotional end to the most impressive long-form storytelling in cinematic history. This film is captivating for its entire 3 hour run time, with every scene and piece of dialogue carefully crafted with purpose. The payoffs and callbacks to previous moments in the MCU are amazing and reward those who have been loyal to this franchise. Avengers: Endgame absolutely surpasses the massive expectations it had and closes the book perfectly on an unprecedented saga of films.",
        "I was born in the 1990s, and I used to envy the \"previous generation \": audiences 40 years ago, whose theaters had the closing scenes of the original Star Wars trilogy; Audiences 20 years ago could see the final chapter of the Lord of the rings in the cinema. Fans have had their ups and downs, but now we have a common memory: the marvel cinematic universe. Thank you, the avengers.",
        "A breathtaking experience. Marvel played it's top trump card and blew alway any competition from start to finish. The battle scene is simply one of the if not greatest pieces of cinema ever. But it kept on giving after this. Anyone who gives this film less than a 10 is selling it extremely short.",
        "Just name is enough! Endgame is biggest blockbuster of the year.",
        "Greeeeeat.\n\nMy rating for the movie story: 9/6 Enjoyable: 8/9 Visual effects: 9/8 To be instructive: 7/9 Emotional: 9/9.",
        "Cast of too many and the depiction of Thor was outrageously pathetic as a super hero's character.",
        "I very much loved this movie, though the beginning act was very slow and drawn out making the film almost boring. The second and third act saved the movie as those were the best parts.",
        "Marvel is on top and will stay on top for years to come.",
        "Goat movie. Your DC could never. Just keep you joker in the s.",
        "I have a strong sentimental attachment for the MCU. I watched the movies for 11 years, and this was almost like a breakup for me. Infinity War was one of my best movie experiences, i was beyond shocked, exited and emotional. And happy, beacause no movie of the mcu has accomplished that in me, and was because the bad guy wins (happy endings got boring honestly), all those uncomfortable one-line jokes and witty remarks were few, all the encounters and character development were meaningful and wonderful set, and the battles, my god, the battles were so epic, so imginative and so so great. all of what this movies lacks. it\u00b4s 3hrs of pure emotion, with a bad written story and not particularly appealing visuals. It seems as if they went with the first draft of the scrpit. i can\u00b4t understand all the glory this movie gets. I feel very ripped off",
        "After so many movies...... It seemed Thanos was more powerful and gave them a beat down without the stones. It would have been nice to see the avengers fight him with all his stones",
        "A true Marvel movie with overwhelming emotions. Thank you Stan Lee!",
        "Avengers: End Game can't compete on its own against the likes of The Godfather, Citizen Kane, or The Dark Knight, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has never been about competing on your own. The MCU parallels it's own characters in the sense that it's strength lies not in each individual, but rather the sum of their parts. Avengers: End Game is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the seemingly untouchable Infinity Saga, whose 10 year presence has changed cinema forever.",
        "Pros: top notch cinematic, over the top action, nice concept of time travel.\n\nCons: chaotic scenes with so many characters, forced cringe moments.",
        "Twenty movies of buildup leads to this; a three hour film that retains remarkably coherent and action-packed despite its length, full of fan-pleasing moments and fulfilment of several deserving character arcs. While not particular groundbreaking in any way, it is tightly plotted to keep the movie moving to near-perfection considering the massive ensemble cast and the amount of expectation it bears. Character arcs set up over years reach a climactic payoff that elicit powerful reactions. However, the plot revolves around massive coincidences and don't-think-too-hard gimmicks, while the great character work Thanos received in the previous film is completely undone here.\n\nAs it was meant to, it acts as a grand ending to this arc of the MCU. Imperfect, yes, but a worthy signoff for years of hard work.",
        "I guess they should have taken more time to create the film with good storyline, It didn't meet the expectation which was set in Infinity war. Very slow pace and messy. Not satisfied.",
        "After 11 years and 22 movies, Marvel Studios brought us the most ambitious movie, the greatest culmination, it is nostalgic, sentimental and completely unexpected. All the characters are so well-balanced, to each one is given plenty of screen time to development. If you're a marvel fan you'll feel like you're finally complete, you've never seen anything like this before, there are many references to all the 22 movies and there is a certain inevitability about the plot, there are plenty surprises. The movie present us an incredible balancing between nostalgia and novelty, you will scream, laugh and cry, it is the Marvel recipe elevated to the highest level. There's just so much in it, that I can't even write about it without spoiling everything. This is not the end for Marvel, but it certainly marks an ending for several of the characters we've watched and loved over the last decade, there will be more superhero franchises but it's hard to imagine any one being so culturally resonant. It is the grande finale.",
        "Yeah it's even much better than all Marvel and dc movies and much better than Dark knight. Finally Marvel did it\ud83d\udc4c More than a Movie",
        "Wow. This film will have you going through every emotion imaginable. If you have followed every Marvel movie in sequence leading up to this conclusion, you will soon be left feeling like you have lost a family member. An amazing end to this Marvel chapter.",
        "I'm a big fan of Marvel movies. I watched it twice in the cinema. The details of the movie are very good, which reminded me of the previous Marvel movies.",
        "Very enjoyable IMAX 3D experience! I love the quantum physics involved, very fascinated by it. A lot of funny jokes & devastating stuff. Top tier Marvel movie difficult to talk about without spoiling anything; definitely worth price of admission - love geeking out for a fun awesome movie!",
        "\"Part of the journey is the end\" - Tony Stark. I was not ready for the end. This movie made me feel those emotions no superhero movie has made me feel before, it even tops the non-superhero movies. I was speechless, teary-eyed, and worried after watching the movie. I am worried and sad because I know that it will never be the same again and I can't digest this fact.",
        "Amazing movie really entertaining.....but it has a very slow first half......and the movie would be quite boring and meaningless if not for its 22 support movies.",
        "Part 1 of the 2 final movies was perfect. Character development was still going forward. Endgame is nothing but a screen full of the characters we have come to know and love. It tried to tell too much so what we ended up with was clips and a lot of jumping around. It was like a movie made up of movie preview clips. What a let down after all these years.",
        "For what it is, it is fine. Enough pew pew pew, smashy smashy and flashy effects and explosions to mindlessly entertain the inner 8 year old.\n\nTHAT is all that this is. Anybody who thinks this type of media deserves the highest marks is a cultural empty vessel. Anybody who thinks this colourful nonsense should be rated like actual movies with actual content is deluded.\n\nMindless escapism is fine. it just isn't art.",
        "Best movie of the decade. As far as what it achieved and it's impact. Just like Avatar 2009 was the movie of the decade, this movie is too. Now sure it's not a 10/10 it's close though. For a movie that has so much background behind it, obstacles to achieve and a movie before it that was arguably one of the greatest last year, this movie had HUGE expectations... and it sure enough delivered... the box office tells you it all. #1 most money made from a film finally beating avatar... this is a beautiful way to close out this decade off to 2020. And DC has a win up their sleeve as well. Having Joker become the first R rated film to surpass 1 billion. They're both swinging strong this year. Good job marvel I see you, im more of a DC fan myself but I want to see them both succeed and this film deserves its 10/10 I was crying twice and laughing more and engaged.",
        "After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.",
        "This movie was a proper letdown for me, mainly due to it being made in service of the characters and not in service of the movie, unlike Infinity War.\n\nI think this movie could've been great or even a masterpiece, because Infinity War certainly was, but for people that aren't invested in the characters and don't like that same old corny comedy and totally predictable outcomes (and major plot holes), it was definitely a letdown.\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad film, how could it? It's a good film that could've been great, that's all I'm saying.",
        "That was one of the best films I have ever watched and to see so many films get tied into one to complete a story was just an amazing experience.",
        "In my opinion this was a huge dissappointment for me. The movie lacks of action and full of irrational content. Its very slow and boring. First half was unnecessary and second half is below par. Im so sad that nearly nothing significant happened in whole 180 minutes. I was expecting the same vibe as infinity war or dark knight but this was more like age of ultron.",
        "Congrats! the first place of box offices ever! to be honest, I saw twice. I felt nothing comparing to the others in the first place. and then, I felt better during the 2nd. it's outstanding truly! it told me everything I wanted to know, and gave me wise answers why they chose.",
        "In many ways what this film does is to be respected, yet many of its scenes are also messy and get to be too convoluted.",
        "I laughed I cried, I shouted at one point. I had my head in my hands. I had my hands in the air. I went back to the box office and booked again.\n\nOne word...... special.\n\nSee it to believe it, a masterclass in film making. And the perfect close to a decade of entertainment and a year of obsession and theorizing (and STILL being off the Mark.)",
        "Unpopular opinion. there are too many plot holes, not an epic movie opposed to what fanboys think. Entertaining but slow paced.I watched IW thrice but wouldn't like to see endgame again.",
        "Avengers: Endgame (2019, Russo Brothers)\n\nSo the culmination of eleven years worth of set up in this Marvel Cinematic Universe that feels like an episodic tv series is about to have its finale and its a big one... over three hours. This film is sure to satisfy those who have been impressed with the last couple of phases of Marvel films, I personally gravitate towards the Phase One films. This direct sequel to last years Infinity War starts off quite slow for the first hour or so and I think this will be the main complaint by most people but I did not mind the low key hangs with these surviving characters. The film does pick up though and has a few laughs along the way, some above average action, fun hijinx but the whole time I am thinking this story is wasted on these terrible visual directors. Marvel films are all pretty bland but the Russos make spectacle so damn ugly. That said most of the conclusions are satisfying from a story point of view bar some small missteps here and there.",
        "Avengers endgame is a movie that lives to the hype with a story that uses its 3 hour runtime well and has so many emotional moments that hit well, an amazing final battle that is so awesome and epic, great performances from everyone, phenomenal visuals, an ending that is satisfying, and has hilarious comedy. The wait was worth it.",
        "The build up has paid off. The characters, the plot, the visuals, the music, the raw action. Everything. This is how a comic book movie is supposed to be portrayed. People or bots writing the 1/10 reviews are people who don't like the comic book industry to begin with but there's a reason this film blew up the box office. Pure adrenaline and emotional moments that balance each other perfectly. I just rewatched the entire Marvel series again because of it.",
        "Avengers Endgame delivers something that is beyond imagination, something is fantasy of every comic book nerd or a cinephile. With extraordinary visual effects, brilliant story telling and top notch acting, avengers endgame delivers a near perfect end to a near perfect saga. the movie delivers every checklist of y nerd fantasy. The final act is the most mesmerizing pay off i have seen in the last decades.",
        "If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics' late creator of many of the company's popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, \"Excelsior!\"",
        "To the best 11 years of my life. Thank you, Marvel, thank you for making my youth have a perfect ending.",
        "I've been a fan of superheroes since I was little kid. When Iron Man was out, I couldn't believe it, it was so good. But, I completely fell in love with the idea of the MCU when I watched Captain America: The First Avenger. Here we are, 10 years later, 10 years loving fictional characters, loving the actors, loving the movies, to have it ending like... well this.\n\nI think they had a great idea, a great way of saying goodbye to the most beloved characters, but I think the movie fell short. I was more emotional during the ending credits than the whole movie. I felt like I needed more, like there was many things left unsaid. Maybe I'll love it the second time I watched it? I don't know honestly, for now, I am a bit disappointed with this one.",
        "Hands off to the last of MCU movies. This whole storyline was a masterpiece. I am going to see these movies again and again and again I will never stop. Thank you Marvel",
        "For me personally this film was just too darned long. As I sat watching it I suddenly realised against all hope and expectation that I was actually a little bored - a feeling I never got from its predecessor.\n\nVisually it's stunning (as you'd expect) and I can see how to a great many people it has the ultimate wow factor but for me it doesn't quite hit the spot.\n\nPersonally I'm struggling to put it in my top 3 MCU movies.\n\nI definitely prefer Infinity War and Guardians Of The Galaxy and then it's a toss up between this, Civil War, The Winter Soldier and Ragnarok.",
        "First half is too long and boring . Thor has been Made a caricature. Too much of importance to captain America and hulk also not used properly. Too much of focus on iron man and takes too long and even make us bore and walk out of film",
        "I'm among those people, who normally don't engage in writing reviews. But this time I really have and want to. I rewatched the infinity-saga prior to Engame's release and there couldn't have been a better ending to it then the one it got. It really has been an epic ride and I feel privileged to have been able to be a part of it. Though only being a spectator, I feel connected to these characters, they are like long know friends. Endgame is the epic and monumental end to the saga which began over a decade ago. And oh it is more then worthy to be the last milestone on this incredible journey. I went through so many emotions watching this, joy, pride, happiness, sorrow and a sense of being alive and what it means to be human. Just watch it, you'll see what I mean, I really don't promise too much. It's truely hard to say goodbye to so many beloved characters, but they get the ending they deserve and will always be the franchise's core. Thank you for this amazing journey Marvel.",
        "Quite disappointed after demise of our beloved tony stark.... miss you 3000",
        "Don't want to be the contrarian, but there were some obvious plotholes that were hidden away by the sheer scale of visual effects and epic action. Watch it for the action, not the plot (which is that of your run-of-the-mill time travel movie).",
        "It suffers from having to follow up one of the most anticipated films ever and even though it is spectacular with everything I still think infinity war is better.",
        "End game was so melodramatic and slow! can't believe it needed 3 hours! I was expecting something ala infinity war, but no, this is no way near that movie...",
        "Watching it in cinemas on release day was incredible but to me it's a one watch thing. People claim this is the best movie of all time go watch something else other than superhero films, most overrated film of all time Imo",
        "It worth the hype, the movie was simply amazing and it had a strong emotional impact, I was diving from laughing to tension and sadness, but after all it was a great movie! All the 1 star reviews are wired in my opinion, those people just throw away with hate without even watching the whole MCU or just because they didn t understand the hype.",
        "Expected more from the Hulk after his no show in Infinity War and then after that mess the writers turn around and make one of the mightiest hero's (Thor) a drunk. Infinity was was far better and it was the perfect set up for End game that the writers screwed up",
        "I'm a huge fan of avengers but lost valuable 3 hours of my life.",
        "Can't complain. Loved the movie. Lots of action and story lines. A lot to keep up with but things tie together nicely. Worth the wait.",
        "So as we know this is the last part of avengers series and for me after this no entertainment is left",
        "To all the people who rated this 1 or 2 stars...WHAT MOVIE did you watch? Just to hear Cap say \"Avengers Assemble\" alone makes this epic...remember the question Mr. Hand asked his class when so many failed the test? This is a great film, action, humor, emotion...all on display...",
        "Lots of unanswered plot holes where the time travel theory doesn't really make any Sense. It enjoyable as other marvel movies but as it's endgame it's lacking some ingredients.",
        "For all the Marvel movies to build up to this and for filming Infinity War and Endgame back to back this was terrible. Infinity War was really good and they clearly backed themselves into a corner for this movie. I question why they didn't rework Infinity War to try and give themselves more flexibility with Endgame since they were filmed back to back.\n\nI don't understand at all the high ratings people have given this movie. Anyone who rated this above a 5 or 6 is delusional if they found this an acceptable Endgame to the Avengers!!",
        "Could have done lot better It was a movie of hulk , cap and iron man talking a loooooooooot and just talking",
        "They made it that way on purpose, so that most people would have to say \"yes, we think we understand, yea...\" so not to look like a bunch of idiots. There's power in the denial! But go watch it for the laughs, I'm not a type of person to cringe over a cheesy joke, but whoever was responsible for comedy relief this time around has gotten to me! Was it RDJ? He a genuinely funny guy.\n\nI rate this sci-fi fantasy: 6/10 -1 for over the top CGI, -2 for deus ex machina, -1 for trying to make me feel for too many characters! Because I can't do lazy writing. and -1 for shameless AUDI plug but I won't go below 6.",
        "My rating for this one is a 5. I almost fell asleep at the first half of the movie. The storytelling is poor, acting is so so, fight sequences are not what I expected. I liked Infinity War much better. My expectation from a 9.1 score movie was pretty high and I was very excited to see this one. But what a disappointment.",
        "Just watched the movie. Despite my best wishes, I simply cannot find myself singing praises to such a poorly-done movie. Ranging from the grossly obvious CGI to the poorly written-out story line, Endgame is extremely underwhelming. Throughout the movie I found myself sitting in utter disbelief as to how Endgame went so wrong after a fantastic Infinity War.",
        "I am a huge fan of marvel. And I was pretty sure that this movie will be legend. And to me it is LEGEND.Scenes was awesome. The scenario was awesome.I think every marvel fan should watch this movie...",
        "In this movie marvel started to change something as we all know and i dont know man not that good at all.",
        "I feel this movie's review is inflated especially when you compare it to other movies at the same rating. I appreciate this movie sort of ending a phase of marvel movies but MCU fans talk about this movie like it's the greatest thing since slice bread. Imo, looking at each marvel movie individually, Winter soldier, GOTG 1, and the OG avengers are much better. Even infinity war is better.\n\nThis movie was okay. For people to say this is the best MCU movie, it's just blatantly false and doesn't even make sense.",
        "Gonna keep it simple here.. The movie is awesome.. Some people may say the movie got plotholes here and there but no.. The plotholes are negligible.. And all make senses. Better than Infinity Wars.. And i don't know what future lies ahead after the ending of Endgame. Would it be better with new line? I hope so.. But this movie really sum up all the hard work of 11 years of MCU. Thank You RDJ for starting all of this.",
        "Marvel has over the years delivered movie after movie and we have been watching. Not only did they give us the ending we needed but they did it in a way which connected everything we have seen through the MCU. I just want to some how forget that the MCU exists so that I can watch all the movies all over again. Will definitely be seeing Endgame again in cinema.",
        "People Who Are saying It very Bad,Go Back 10 yrs Back and Watch The Whole Marvel Series Again, Then only You will Understand This Movie,I liked it Because I understood Everything ,I felt the 3hr like 1hr",
        "Don't even try to except anything when you go to see the movie because even if you will try super hard, there is no way you can guess what will happen. The movie has an amazing story, twists, fight scenes, and some really emotional scenes too. It will give you everything you want to it to show you and even more. So trust me, Do not waist and go watch this beautiful movie when you have a chance to.",
        "This is the best movie. wathced it so many times and still watching.",
        "Well, I never thought I would be in a movie theatre where men and woman were crying in a superhero movie, but it happened. Robert Downey gave his best performance to date imho. Cheering, laughing, crying, and a good old fashioned round of applause at the end, says it all. A very good movie, I scored 8.5. I would definitely go and see it again, after I did I might give it a 9. Fitting finale to a fantastic franchise",
        "Endgame has some really fun and epic moments. It also has some very emotional moments. But this movie is far from a \"love letter\" to fans of the OG6 Avengers, as some critics have claimed. Far from it. Endgame basically steamrolls over 10 years of character development for most of the OG6, especially Tony, Steve, and Thor. I was extremely disappointed with how these characters were treated, because they deserved so much better than Endgame. Instead of resolving their character arcs in a satisfying and sensical way, the Russos decided to go for meaningless shock value and \"fanservice\" that only makes sense to them (and not the majority of fandom). This is like Age of Ultron all over again, except much more depressing and upsetting. A shameful end to a wonderful saga.",
        "The plot is compact and the details are excellent! Many tears, touching. Set the whole room roaring with laughter and make complaints about the max. Although I think about it carefully, the plot is still a bit buggy. For example, where does someone's army get so many particles to transmit. In the past, Loki ran away with the magic cube of the universe, whether it would affect the later time line changes, how to get back on track, dare not play through the details, that's all.",
        "As Avengers and Iron Man big fan, I'm writing this review, and I'm tryna watching this movie first time at home. Well, if in the cinema I was waiting something great, second time I'm knew there's nothing. Some sad scenes and dramatic tear-jerking, dear directors, are you serious? It's super hero movie not a drama come-on! Directors of this movie attempted to create Santa Barbara. Action scenes very poor like in low budget movies. There's no some great Iron Man's suit regeneration, or other new features. Just couple seconds of poor action with Tony Stark awaits you. If you need love line between Natasha and Archer, maybe it's worth watch it, otherwise no",
        "If you are in your 20s, well, you might love this movie. If you are in your 30s like me, god I can\u00b4t even begin on how much of a disapointment this movie is. At least MCU is over now. No need for us that started this back in Iron man in our early 20s to keep up with all the non stop movies shoved at us.\n\nGL next generation, hope you enjoy the new Universe. Because after this, I am done.",
        "He deserves an OSCAR. What he did for marvel and the fans was great. I'm great full to TONY STARK. LOVE YOU 3000.\ud83d\udc94",
        "I'm confused... How can one fail so miserably when you have basically an infinite budget to create a film?!\n\nWhat a let down! Who even gives a about Hawkeye?!",
        "I don't understand all the bad reviews, I watched 22 of the MARVEL movies in the correct order, thank you Covid, and so glad I did..I understand so much more of the characters. Love this one best, yes I so sobbed again. Long live Stan Lee.",
        "This was a great movie and a proper end to the series.\n\nBesides some convoluted continuity issues, it was very well done.\n\nAnd the best part of all, minimal screen time for the newest and most widely hated Avenger of the bunch, CM.",
        "What a brilliant way to follow Infinity War. Actually, Let me look at it more vaguely. What a brilliant film. This superhero blockbuster is not the usual to say the least. Most emotions we feel day to day are heightened at certain points in the film, causing you to laugh out loud, whimper, clap, or cry. This is DC's \"the Dark Knight\". This is television's \"Game of Thrones.\" This is the Endgame.",
        "Endgame is a fun movie to go see, it has its problems but is a fun movie. These reviews on here giving it 10 out of 10 and saying that is the first perfect movie are 100% wrong. Dont go in expecting this movie to be better than godfather or citizen kane as these reviews describe. It's a fun movie with fun action, no it's not an oscar contender, no it's not a ground breaking never before been done movie, and no it is not a 10 out of 10 perfect movie. Go in expecting a fun watch with some cringy comedy and you will enjoy the experience. But dont listen to the people saying that this is a perfect movie, or the best ever made.",
        "Good CGI, script is built up on a lack of basic logic and reasoning. Then again... is it that big of a surprise? Love this somewhere in the 300-400 range.",
        "Think that summarises it. Look the plot has the odd nice twist and some of the jokes hit home but honestly three hours with this sort of pacing is a struggle. Think I'd have preferred to watch it at home.",
        "The Infinity War was 10 times better. The end game is just way to long and boring",
        "This was eye candy and fan service at its finest but then again, that's what the general audience wants",
        "For the past 11 years MCU has been increasing their fan base across the globe with larger than life characters. Avengers : End Game: With the expectations sky high, the Russo brothers delivered a fitting finale to this franchise. What worked: 1. The emotions were very well connected with the audience. 2. Jaw dropping CGI and VFX. 3. The last battle.\n\nWhat could have been better: 1. Screenplay a bit slow. 2. The war sequence could have been a bit lengthier.\n\nOverall, this experience is for a life time and hence everyone should enjoy this wonder movie in IMAX",
        "Save your money and time. This movie could've been done in a hour and half. Big disappointment compared to the other avengers movies.",
        "The movie drags on at points and the beginning and goes into some tropes that create problems.\n\nFeels like a clear step back in character writing for the villains, excellent final act and epilogue.\n\nInfinity war is ultimately the superior movie.",
        "I don't know what I'm feeling after I finished the movie should i cry or being happy or what!!",
        "Drama 4/5 Action 5/5 Vfx cgi 5/5 Humour 3.5/5 Suspens 3/5",
        "The climax that all fans deserve. Marvel still pulls out surprises that you couldn't dream of, allowing this to earn a spot anongst some of the greatest films made. The length yields an utterly satisfying scene, but honours the 11 years of the studio with the perfect ending.",
        "Great movie But not better then infinity war. Ending was the best part of it",
        "The best super hero film ever made! Just like my headline says. Watch this masterpiece for the love of God! This and infinity war are on totally different levels to any other super hero film. And this goes one level better than infinity war, absolutely fantastic.",
        "Avengers Endgame is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, existing to reward the fans love, patience, and undying adoration. Endgame has a difficolt job and did it very well. It's epic and allows space for one of the best performances from Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evan. However this movie has something less than Infinity War. The entire time I was watching Infinity War I was on the edge of my seat, afraid for every character's life, but not during all the running time of Endgame. Nevertheless Endgame has more epic moments and it is such a perfect end of the Avengers that it's hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed.\n\nRating: 9,3.",
        "If you think you have figured it out all yet you haven't, amazing ending to the greatest saga, 3 hours have passed like it was an hour, the humor is there, the tears, the powerful visuals, won't say much, every person has to see it. Amazing amazing amazing",
        "It's just one big mess and I fell asleep. I kept wondering what was even happening??",
        "Avengers: Endgame really is the perfect conclusion to the magnificent MCU! Seeing this in the cinema was something else to experience the atmosphere around me. The final battle was done to perfection and the bittersweetness throughout the film gives it a feeling of being real and not just a bunch of superheroes flying around invincibly. If you have followed the rest of the MCU, then this will wrap it all up perfectly. As a stand alone film, it is a fantastic watch!",
        "Highly recommend watching especially if you enjoyed infinity way\n\nA must watch for all Marvel fans.",
        "Being a big fan of the Marvel Universe I was very disappointed to first sit through two hours of a very weird, boring and depressing Inception-like Movie. They had a lot of good ideas but didn't manage to make it a good movie. If you can just skip the first two hours and watch the ending. I was so pissed when the good parts came that I had a hard time really enjoying them.",
        "I've been looking forward to this for so long, and it surpassed all my expectations. It is a thrilling ride, an emotional journey, and has comedic moments as well. It even causes tears to fall. I can't wait to watch it again.",
        "Predicted end ! Weak drama ! Graphics was not that high !\n\nInfinity war was way better than this !",
        "The genre has been completed. It was the best superhero film ever. It completed an epic journey of superhero films.",
        "No words for this flim. This is an epic flim. Marvel studios never disappoint his fans.",
        "The movie is devoid of logic and has innumerable plot holes. This is just an embarrassment on part of cinema.",
        "Great movie i almost cried and great ending to the series of movies",
        "I cried like hell, laughed like hell, enjoyed like hell, every second of it. An experience you will never forget or regret for the rest of yoir life, emotionally satisfying.\n\nThe Russo Brothers did an exceptional job at creating a powerful end to the the Infinity Saga connecting every movie of Phase III through an emotional roller coaster ride like never before bringing the the Avengers to an epic conclusion. Of course, words cannot describe how exhilarating this movie is, especially if you are a fan. So, nothing more, witness this masterpiece before you die!\n\n\"Everybody deserves a happy ending\" -Tony Stark.",
        "This movie was meant to be watched in an IMAX theater, especially because the sound makes up a very important part of the movie. To be honest, there were times when I felt that this movie is definitely 3 hours, but I can see why it was so necessary. This movie truly delivers what it promises it would! This movie really marks an important era in cinema.",
        "First 2 hours are kind of dull. I was expecting more frankly. Reckon it's predictable as well, the last hour was entertaining though.",
        "They landed the plane. You cannot do a better job of ending a gigantic story. Kudos to the Russo brothers and the entire cast.",
        "There couldn't be a better ending to the infinity saga than this one. 3hrs of my life justified, Marvel didn't screw up forget about all the negative reviews. Watch its predecessors and then give endgame a shot. Trust me you would watch it more than 1.",
        "I watched avengers infinity war as the second movie of the mcu i watched next day i watched end game I considered end game as a terrible drama and the first hour was terrible then when the movie was going on I didn't enjoy it accept at the final battle it was the only thing i love then time by time decided to watch all 23 mcu movies in chronological and when i reached at end game I really loved it and enjoyed every minute in it and it was a great ending for the mcu but until now they're going on and they're doing well those bad ratings about this movie is because they didn't watch all mcu movies maybe they watched 5 of them at least they are stupid and dont trust them when they say this movie is terrible.",
        "What a great entertainer. One of the finest movies of recent times. Everyone thought storyline will be predictable. But it actually isn't. We witnessed so twist and turn in the movie. It was emotional and chances are that you will leave the theatre crying and heartbroken. Overall I think it's a great farewell to avengers. Thank you MCU for another masterpiece. I give 10/10 to this last Avenger movie. Go and watch this epic movie.",
        "This film is obviously for fanboys bcoz the story is illogical as thw time travel. There's too many plot holes and has made no sense.",
        "A movie bigger than this has never been made or attempted. Critics who do not appreciate the movie or say its 'just another superhero movie' take this movie alone. This is NOT a standalone movie, its a closing to a spectacular franchise and it was satisfying on so many levels, I cant even explain. There were so many moments in the movie that made one appreciate the depth of character, backstory,human bonding, sacrifice and ofcourse comedy and action, that I cannot even point them out even if I wanted to.\n\nTo enjoy the movie, at least watch most of the MCU movies. This is the movie of the decade and you WILL ENJOY THIS",
        "It's so decent that I don't have anything to say lmao.",
        "The movie was ok, not willing to watch the 2nd time",
        "Finally it has come to an end. No idea whatsoever why I have watched these very merican action movies. Do yourself a favour and watch paint dry instead. The entire movie I was wondering: What the hell is going on now... Maybe it could have saved the movie if they had cut down on the cost of the special effects and payed for a decent manuscript. Who knows. Another thought... Why can anyone but Thor carry mj\u00f8lner? If anyone find these magic stones please undo this movie. Thanks.",
        "3 hours of crap. One guy says time is not linear and damn! Quantum physics solved.",
        "This was one of the greatest movie experiences of all time for me.",
        "She is a minor character just like many others we have met throughout the years, helping out in the fight against Thanos.\n\nThe movie is at times a little bit slow and dark (also in the literal sense), but is ultimately a worthy final chapter in Marvel's 22-film saga.\n\nThere is exactly one 10-second \"girl power\" moment in the movie, so for those who worried that Endgame would become a \"SJW mess\", it isn't.",
        "This is the movie everyone will love to see.. But you should be a true mcu fan to feel the film",
        "Avengers endgame is an amazing movie, a perfect payoff of all previous films. The fight scenes are some of the greatest scenes ever. Gotta thank Marvel studios for this film.",
        "Good movie & emotional but not better than infinity war and 3 hours i saw it so long and first hour was so boring and for the time travel was so Provocation any ideas for time traveling Russo brothers do what they want and don't care for our minds I Think the time travel is owned by DC sorry marvel",
        "It's really not amazing - if really is flawed hugely.......none of the plot makes any sense and it has ruined future marvel movies with its awful writing......I don't understand people who have given it such a high score. If you truly step away and think about it the flaws, plot holes and disregard for future and old marvel movies - you kinda can see what a bad movie it is! My advice go read the comics - they are so much better than any marvel movie!\n\nMarvel have only had 2 or 3 really good movies - and about 18ish standard or awful movies......I hope they reboot the entire universe- which I'm guessing they are gonna do because of how they have messed everything up in this movie!",
        "I think that this film gets a good ending for the infinity stone's saga. The battles, the great amount of characters and the plot itself are the bests to end this saga and continue with a new saga of the MCU.",
        "As a Fan I feel Like cheated by Marvel Studios. Avengers: Endgame is a cut paste collage of previous movies & sloppy VFX ( one can watch it under magnifying glass when its Blu Ray is released). Within 3 hours of this movie 1.5 hours was of repetitions. After all the hype, theories & speculations, All that Anthony & Joe Russo cooked was a plot that even a Kindergarten MCU fan could've scripted better and Many succeeded with their far Superior imagination & theories than MCU team. Time Travel is a pathetic excuse to deal with Thanos after all the wonderful Avengers Series MCU has executed on Cinematic world Arena. It felt like they knew Endgame would be the Big Hit so they served the old potpourri with not more than 10 minutes of WOW action moments. Stan Lee's demise affected the outcome of this Movie that could have been the Milestone for Cinema Entertainment for Years to come. Wonder if this is highest Peak of MCU's Success Story. 6 Stars for many disappointments",
        "Reading through some of the low mark reviews from what one can only presume are DC fans I can assure the hand full of people whom are yet to see this movie that this is without any doubt a masterpiece in modern movie making. I've read comments on how the first third of the film is 'too slow' but this is totally necessary due the need to portray the weight of devastation caused by the snap from the end of the Infinity War instalment, as a stand alone movie it's quite the spectacle however to truly appreciate it I would recommend seeing all the previous MCU movies from the past 10 years chronological to truly benefit from all the call backs. Go see it, buy it, marvel at it and maybe DC can learn a thing or two from it.",
        "Would i say this a well made movie? Yes. Would I say it's well acted? Yes. Would I say it lived up to the hype when it came out? Yes...and No. This movie just didn't hit it for me. I wanted to like it a lot! but I ended up just coming out the theater just kinda disappointed that it really wasn't that good.",
        "This should be higher up the top 250! It was such a great surprise! I've never see anything like it! It was such an epic superhero movie and I loved every minute of it! It has to be one of my all time favourite superhero movie and absolutely favourite movie ever! I can't believe the outcome though! There won't be anymore avengers movies after this!",
        "This movie is all That I wanted from a movie for a long time im still on the hypetrain eventhough I am a couple of tv show episodes behind but I try to clear everything up, cant wait until future project.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is literally everything you have wanted AND MORE in a Marvel movie. I'm not going to lie, it is slow to get into at the start, but the last hour is the reason I HAD TO give this film a 10/10. Honestly, as everyone has mentioned, it's a culmination of everything good in Marvel. It's beauty, perfection and whatever else you can think of. Endgame lived up to its hype and certain characters truly ended in such an amazing way. You'll never expect ANYTHING. No joke, I am going to have to go watch this again!! 3000% recommended ;-)",
        "There are so many 10/10 ratings on here for this film but frankly it's not that good, the hype was better than the film. Yes it had great moments and I'm not saying it's a bad film because it's not. But it's not the best film the MCU have ever made.",
        "What a great entertainer. One of the finest movies of recent times. Everyone thought storyline will be predictable. But it actually isn't. We witnessed so twist and turn in the movie. It was emotional and chances are that you will leave the theatre crying and heartbroken. Overall I think it's a great farewell to avengers. Thank you MCU for another masterpiece. I give 10/10 to this last Avenger movie. Go and watch this epic movie.",
        "This movie was a great conclusion to the last 11 years of the MCU. You will laugh, you will cheer and you will even cry. This movie takes multiple unexpected turns. When this movie unfolds you surprisingly get to learn more about the characters that survived the Snap. MCU took a different style of storytelling which was very risky for a marvel movie, but they pulled it off. If you are thinking of watching this movie, I strongly recommend that you stay away from as many spoilers as possible. Trust me, the less you know about the movie the more you will love it. Go see it ASAP. I love it 3000.",
        "I mean it's okay to not like a movie but seriously 1 star reviews do not change the fact that avengers endgame despite its flaws is still an incredible achievement.",
        "Wow! This movie will blow you away. You will feel every human emotion in this movie. It's a must watch!",
        "Its amazing and is the perfect continuation of Infinity War, It's so amazing that ot brings down tears in yoir eyes in more 1 or 2 scenes.",
        "The ones who rated the movie 1-5. Did not pay attention and watch all the other 21 movies. How weird people.",
        "First I wanna say that i'm not the biggest marvel fan! I like the movies, But they're not the best movies in the world! I think the hype around it is way too much! Anyway, after saying that, it was definitly the best marvel movie till now! I got goosebumps, I almost cried sometimes, I laughed, I screamed. Eventhough i'm not the biggest fan, I still loved it, and Everyone have to see this movie",
        "It can't get better than this. Best MCU and Marvel movie IMO.",
        "The movie is spectacular. Great special effects and a couple of twists. It's a bit long (around 3 hours), but it's totally worth it. I recomend it to kids 10 to 21 years old. (I'm 12). Cool movie. Marvel has totally succeeded.",
        "The worst avengers with weird plotchanges that took no risks. With a predictable story and predictable ending. Boring at times.",
        "This movie is absolutely amazing. I enjoyed almost every part of the amazing journey. Much better then infinity war and it truest lives up to the incredible hype it created over time. 10/10 would recommend.",
        "Everything that marvel has worked on for the past decade comes down to this epic climax. Surprisingly enough they pulled it off. It's not like every other Marvel movie where they all feel like a commercial for a movie that has yet to be made, this time it really feels like an ending but also a new beginning in a different direction. Despite it's grand spectacle they're never seem to quite grow from the formulaic storytelling, the only difference in this movie being there is more subplots. It is quite boring even for a superhero movie, running at an astonishing 3 hours, they spent the first half setting up for the giant climax that is basically a mindless action scene inserted with some emotional scenes that holds no value to me. On one hand this movie does its job as an homage and a fan service, on the other hand it is still the same old superhero movie that lacks risk and anything that challenge the viewers.",
        "The best MCU movie i've ever seen. And I could not control my sobbing during certain scenes which I am not going to spoil it here just for you guys. You all have to see this!!!!!!! A must watch.",
        "Avengers : End Game was way too long. They could have wrapped up this story in 1hr 30min instead of stretching it out to 3hr. If you are less than a rabid fan I would recommend that you see this film at home. The crowd in my theater was attentive but strangely quiet and I didn't get much of a sense of excitement from the audience. Black Widow and Hawkeye had the best stories in this film and Ironman second. Ant man showed up and was fun and Rocket (the trash panda) represented the Guardians of the Galaxy (I'm a big Rocket fan \ud83d\ude0a). I did not care for the Thor bit. I was disappointed with how they handled Thor's character - it just wasn't funny. The other Marvel characters showed up but the directors could have just set up cardboard cutouts and had voiceovers for all they contributed to the story line. It does not work as a stand-alone film - you have to have seen the previous films to understand it. I made my poor sister go to the movie with me (she had not seen all the previous films) and she felt tortured and bored (her words). She said that I now owe her \"big time\" Sheesh...",
        "You've got to be a real fan boi to give this clunker a review score of 10. Without the few decent action sequences, this might have been the worst movie period. Somewhat dull from start to finish.",
        "Kinda slow eh? Long drawn out scenes where nothing. not even music is playing. Hulk did nothing, Thor was fat the whole movie,...and The biggest flop Ms marvel did nothing and was in the movie for 6 seconds in a less than spectacular final fight scene. Other than that the movie was pretty great...just slower and not as interesting as Infinity War.",
        "Okay..so spoilers be darned..THis movie was kinda very slow. Still a great movie. But can we talk about the \"Captain Marvel\" SCAM. They tricked us into thinking that Marvel played a big part in this movie. When she only has about 12 seconds of air time...12 seconds...ok that is an exaggeration...it was probably 10 seconds.",
        "The hype surrounding this film after Infinity War was unavoidable. This is the finale to a very long lead up of films and that final action scene is money well spent. Endgame doesn't have that flawless conclusion but at least it's ambitious. It is exactly how a massive ensemble cast should be filmed and it never feels one sided, it's an Avengers film. My issue with the film is more about the repeating villain and large plot holes left from the time travel. It lacks answers and leaves the clean-up to Spiderman Far From Home. I miss the times when films had to be complete and explained. Infinity War was a better film and offered more.",
        "This movie is just very overrated and bad. The visuals and effects were amazing, but the story was dumb and boring, half the characters were cringy and stupid, and it was just mostly talking for 2 hours 30 minutes, I had to speed up the movie 2x I was so bored and still understand what they were saying because they were talking so slow. This movie is like infinity war but the heroes make a ridiculous comeback and defeat thanos which is a way more boring and unoriginal ending. Worse than infinity war and not a good movie 3/10.",
        "This movie has the absolute perfect balance of fan service and harsh moments. Lean into the tears and suspend a little disbelief. This movie is everything we needed and more than we deserved.",
        "Endgame \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb Don't watch it with preconceived notions of what it's going to be. Forgive it's minor faults, it's a bloody great super hero movie.",
        "I'm sorry, i only got 10/10.. if i could, i'll give you 11/10. :) The very best way to ending your Infinity Saga..",
        "Masterpiece. The avengers endgame marvel is super hit.",
        "Great movie...very good vfx and brilliant acting...gave goosebumps many times.",
        "After Avengers Infinity War , I am eagerly waiting for this movie .We have several expectation form this movie , I can gladly say that this movie has worked on every single part of the movie and none a single second seems to be boring. This movie also became the highest grossing movie for a time . All I loved this movie about that , it has covered all people's expectation , that's why I loved this movie.",
        "Couldnt help feeling that Endgame is to Infinity Wars what Dark Knight Rises was to Dark Knight.\n\nA good follow up but the bar was already set too high. Very entertaining, with a satisfying ending, but got there after quite a few plot holes and unanswered questions.\n\nIt felt like the writers wrote the ending first and then tried really hard to take us to that end, regardless of what plot holes they were forced to leave in the wake.\n\nPS didn't really like what they did to Thor and Hulk. Good for laughs maybe, but the characters deserved better",
        "Its have emotion, fun,war,love and more ... When I watch the movie that was my feall,its bern a fantastic movie. Evry one is fantastic but i must say Robert Dawney jr deserve oscer for best supporting actor category.",
        "The avengers go out with a bang in this movie. It's fun, it's emotional, it's action packed, it has surprises, it does the ending of the avengers movies justice. It starts out slower but it's all worth it for the end. It had moments where people cried, clapped and gasped. Go see it!",
        "It was alright. Lots of potholes and not much action.",
        "A brilliant ending to the Avengers series. It doesn't top Infinity War which is simply in a league of it's own, but it does do it justice. It's a slower pace than Infinity War, but the build up is worth it.\n\nI knocked off a few stars for what they did with Hulk and Thor, who were two of my favourite characters from the franchise, especially after Ragnarock.\n\nIt's a shame that there won't be another Avengers movie after this one, but I guess all good things come to an end.",
        "This film was good enough. Neatly ended the group of films. All these low ratings. Kinda baffles me as it was a well made superhero film. I suppose it's not for everyone.",
        "Very good \ud83d\udc4d film you have to see this at least on e time in your life.",
        "Where Avengers 3 excelled in action, this one excels in boredom. The two are like day and night, the Ying and Yang of movies.\n\nInfinity Wars:15 minutes of talk, the rest action. Endgame: 15 minutes of action the rest talk and selfpitty.\n\nSee this because you have to, not because of the inflated ratings.\n\nAvengers 3: 10/10 Avengers 4: 4/10",
        "Avenger endgame is one of the best movies of all time. I was eagerly waiting for about an era to watch this movie and the waiting is worth it.",
        "I just watched this for the second time, (first was in the theater) and wow, i cant Believe that this was 3 hours, its sooo good, it goes by so fast! i loveed every part ! all the throw backs to previous MCU movies, this movie manages to be the funniest and most heart breaking movie within the MCU. i don't have much thats bad to say... i did not like stan lees cameo, captain marvel is so blah, and besides that, its perfect!\n\ni don't see any body who calls them self a Marvel fan could not enjoy this movie, that just blows my mind....",
        "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"Avengers: Endgame\" (2019) was funny, a bit sad, very entertaining, spectacular and maybe a bit too long for me personally. I did enjoy this movie from start till finish though, and while its not my personal favorite from them all, this was a very solid movie in my opinion (and i'm not a huge fan of these movies to start with, so tears haven't been found during my watch).\n\nOverall, \"Avengers: Endgame\" brings half of the Hollywood famous actors into one big, entertaining 3 hours (!) long escapism. At the end i enjoyed this film much more then i thought i will be.",
        "Excellent, the Best of the Best ! Great 10 years of MCU \ud83c\udf77",
        "This movie was so unbelievably great along with the amazing cast. It DEFINITELY DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!!",
        "I am a big fan of marvel movies but avengers is my all time favourite and this time mavel has rocked out. The best superhero movie i have ever seen. This movie has everything we need in a movie, it has action, comedy, emotions and all so this is the best movie.",
        "This movie was a perfect sendoff. I can't even describe what I liked since I would be here all day. I was crying of joy and sadness the entire last hour. Was definetely worth the extra price for IMAX.",
        "It's been just over a decade since Marvel Studios launched its flagship franchise of interconnected comics-inspired movies with 2008's Iron Man, and even now it's difficult to begin to evaluate how much that franchise has changed the face of filmmaking. After 10 years, 21 films, nearly a dozen television shows, countless tie-in comics and games and merchandising options and viral videos, and billions upon billions of dollars in earnings, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become the Holy Grail that every major studio is questing after, usually with little success.",
        "I'm not sure where to rate this movie because there's a lot of different angles to it. There are many plot holes. There is some humor that doesn't work as well as I'd like it to. I don't believe it's the best marvel movie. BUT... this movie is awesome. Make me feel something real from just a screen and you've achieved something and the Russo brothers did just that. Yes, the time travel logic will definitely not be accurate if you take the \"time\" (see what I did there) to dissect it, but this film did something pretty new. It connected over 20 movies into one grand conclusion that pays off better than any other piece of media that I've ever seen. Problems with the flick? A few sure. Any resentment? Pretty much none. You can't please everyone, but these guys probably did the best job they could and I love them 3000",
        "I'm not being biased as a hard core Marvel fan this movie concluded my childhood and teenage years and that's it , it's an emotional tear jearker . Don't expect it to be as action packed as Infinity War - for me the best super hero movie ever - and to make such sense as Infinity War",
        "Good job for the special effects. I know they worked a lot on this. BUT is so stupid that every character is so serious, but you can't take them serious, and it gets realy lame.\n\nI lasted like 15 minutes. I couldn't.\n\nThe only super hero movie that is good i think is deadpool, he's funny at least. You can't make a superhero movie with \"serious\" characters, bc it will turn out really bad.",
        "For the entire first hour, I was really straining to hear the dialog. I stepped out and asked the theater manager to turn it up and ... maybe they didn't. But my sister (on the other side of the planet) said it was the same thing. Did the producers intentionally make the first hour super-quiet to get us to \"lean in\" and pay closer attention maybe?\n\nAudio problems or not, by the end, I was really confused with so many questions ... and didn't feel super-motivated to watch the whole thing again to figure out all the little plot holes that were left untidied. I guess I'll have to wait for the Honest Trailer version to come along and explain everything... :)",
        "The first half of the movie is incredibly boring, second half is awesome. No emotional attachment to the final scene, it dragged on way too long.\n\nInfinity war was way better in my opinion, better balance between action and slow scenes.",
        "I really liked this movie, but the plot holes. Wayyy too many plot holes and basically... with time travel unlocked they can do whatever now. Like, come on. Good idea but the execution was pretty awful. I still love the movie but I hate the billions of plot holes.",
        "Where to start???? This is such a bad movie that I am so disappointed with Marvel. Can't believe critics who are rating such movies so high. Its very clear that we cannot go by what critics say. Good movies are bad and bad movies are good!!",
        "Amazing cast amazing performances...its successful not just as a superhero movie but as a film in general",
        "Everyone knows Endgame. I would rate the film as follows\n\n1. Characters 10 2. Acting 10 3. Plot 9 4. Cinematography 10 5. World building 9\n\nWe have stellar characters and acting that you could rate 11 with Tony Stark, Spiderman, Thor, Ant man, Captain America, Black Panther but we also have other characters that are more an 8-9 with Rody, Hawkeye, Vision, Scarlet Witch, but overall that's a 10 I have to admit.\n\nHowever, the plot could be a tiny bit better and the film feels a bit too long, so plot only gets a 9.",
        "Endgame is an epic adventure , emotional roller-coaster with full of plot twists and conclusion to all that 11 years of storytelling. while watching #endgame I was laughing so loud, clapping so hard and got emotional in the end. What an experience! Sooo Goood.",
        "I absolutely love this movie! This film totally blew me away with such a remarkable story! To those not so true believers of marvel who thinks this film is not worth the money and say that it's not the greatest film ever. YOU SUCK! As a filmmaker I really appreciate what the Russo brothers did! Thank you Russo brothers for another great Marvel film! And god bless Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Steve Ditko for creating such remarkable characters that has touched my heart!",
        "This was the epic conclusion to 22 movies of the mcu and what a conclusion, the cinematography, the action, the emotions is just some of the amazing things in the best ever superhero movie",
        "I saw this in the theater, It was awesome, and just when you think it can't any better it does...",
        "Before reading this, I just request you to take two minutes and think of best possible conclusion to this 22 movies saga. Thought of one? Now multiply the awesomeness of your ending by a 100 times and still this movie will surprise your assumptions! If a critic like me who just can't stop finding errors in a movie failed in finding big mistakes in this movie, I think you should believe this one is just perfect! Sure there were a few tweaks, but I am ready to ignore them seeing how smoothly the whole 3 hours of the runtime just passed by. I was literally sticked to my seat for 3 hours, even during the interval, I was like I want to see the whole movie in one length. Tell you the truth, I was not much impressed with Infinity wars or Ragnarok (not even mentioning captain marvel here xD), but Russo brothers just nailed this one. After waiting for 21 movies, we deserved a perfect end, and we got one. 10/10 from my side. If 21 movies lead to this, I am ready to watch another set of 21 for such a perfection!",
        "This is really nice and full of action. It is the best among all avenger movies and I love HULK. The action of this movie is so much fantastic and...uff!! All animation is awesome and also fighting scenes.",
        "It started back in 2008 with Ironman. And about 20 movies after that, phase 3 of the MCU ends with Endgame. And what an end it is! Goosebumps everytime I see the portals scene. Thank you!\n\nHaters take a chill-pill and try not to choke on it...",
        "This movie is absolute garbage. The hype for this movie was incredible, but the movie failed to live up to the hype. 20 mins fight sequence in a 3 hour film \ud83d\ude02. This movie is a waste of time and whoever watches this crap, please help them",
        "Not a great film, sorry. At the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is. I felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him.",
        "As a big fan of Marvel, end game cannot be better to me. However, the greater end game is, the more worry I have for future Marvel movies without Iron Man and Cap",
        "I am not a big fan of Marvel movies. They are on average pretty dumb, makes no sense, and no internal logic or coherence, and usually ends with a horrible CGI massive and boring battle. This movie is exactly like that. But like most Marvel movies it is also very fun. The first two third of even better than average, the first act being 'The Leftovers' - Marvel edition, and the second act a fun heist movie, but the ending is so by the book and uninspiring that I was quite underwhelmed overall. If you want to see good action - MI6 last year put the bar very high, and this movie was not even close.",
        "This movie is amazing and deserves as much love as it gets 10 out of ten.",
        "Fascinated to see all the super heroes..but more surprises and high moments were expected",
        "All through this movie it just feels like they are setting up an homage to the past marvel movies and characters, this in itself is not a bad ploy but the way it is executed is lame. They do not even try to make it interesting. And the whole movies drags along this way like it is entering some kind of depression. The Quantum time travel idea is extremely badly executed. it seems the idea was just an excuse to visit past movies and characters. In addition the characters are lame, they just don't have any mojo about themselves. It just feels like they knew it was the end and everybody appears bored or not interested. The last fight is pathetic. Again no excitement at all. And the heroes that died felt like they had to die just for the sake of it. Pathetic movie, even by Marvel standards.",
        "Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team.",
        "If you're a follower of the MCU like myself then you don't need to read any reviews to convince you to watch this movie, it's the culmination of years of movies and a must see for fans. It's Filled with epic, emotional, sad and funny moments with tons of details for those who have been following all the previous movies, It's what you'd expect from a movie with this caliber and more. I'm excited to see what the future holds for MCU and if it's going on with the same execution as this one then i'll be really satisfied.",
        "Not enough time for all the characters. Should have been a two parter",
        "Spectacular, amazing and worth the wait. For me it was thanos again the fruit of ot all. Sad ending for a marathonatic story.",
        "There will be a lot of people gushing on here about this movie. Make no mistake, it was good, just not great. 21 films leading up to this point have built the tension, and what should have been a sonic boom was closer to a car backfiring. At three hours, this is a long movie. While there are moments of great humor and great sadness and great happiness, it also dragged in spots. One would expect it to be 95% action, but they spent a lot of time on fluff. Again, do not misunderstand me. I liked this movie quite a bit, but I wanted to love it, and sadly I didn't.",
        "The amazing fight scenes and CGI aren't enough to mask the fact that the overall plot of going back in time to change reality is just plain stupid and lazy - and this is addressed to the writers. I did know that there was gonna be some time travel involved, but the way Marvel explained and executed it didn't too well for me. They can't get away with just putting it all in \"Quantum.\"",
        "The usual serious drama superhero film from Disney aimed at teenagers and above. Should be more universal. I'd prefer it to have a lighter more fun tone to it, like Guardians of the Galaxy achieved for an ensemble cast of heroes.",
        "To keep this short and sweet, Avengers Endgames is one of the most visually pleasing movies of the year next to Alita Battle Angel. But what stops short is the political messages driven into this movie. Socialist activist, people who cry over star wars trailers and folks who say the world will end in 12 years will love this movie and won't miss a beat. But for those who are more attune and aware of forced idealism in entertainment to push across a progressive narrative may find it overpowering and in your face a certain moments. Other aspects left me a little disappointed as well, but not enough to get up and leave the theatre. Also to eveeyone giving this ten stars. Check out their activity and user names. Someone is really trying to boost this movie.",
        "Just wow. This is the 1st time I have watched a movie and everybody clapped at the end of it. It is one of if not the best movie I have ever seen. No wonder it is breaking records. I will go and see it again",
        "It's an ok movie but do not go in believing all the hype and expecting a perfect movie... if so you will probably be disappointed...they should have cut it down about an hour and it would have been much better",
        "Well it's been a hell of a wait since Infinity War, but the Russo Brothers have delivered in spectacular style and quality.\n\nI loved this film in all its entirety and encourage everyone who goes see it to do a toilet check before the titles roll.\n\nIt is an immense roller-coaster with many twists and turns.\n\nThe studio keeps getting better and I hope it continues for years to come. Don't be dissuaded by the feature length of just over 3 hours, this is a MARVELlous spectacle for all to see!\n\nMake mine Marvel True Believers!! Full marks.",
        "You may wonder why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10, and frankly the only reason is that I prefer Infinity War. Regardless, Endgame is the culmination of everything we've wanted from Marvel. The fan service is tasteful, the long runtime becomes unnoticeable due to how engaging and fun the plot is, and the finale is just something else. A must watch in the MCU.",
        "As a Marvel fan, all I can say is that I am very much thrilled, and satisfied with how the Endgame turned out. The CGI was great, the story on point, and it brought back to life all the superheroes that I love.",
        "I am a post-90s generation, and I used to envy the \"previous generation\": audiences 40 years ago, the end of the Star Wars trilogy in their theaters; 20 years ago, audiences can see the ring in the theater The final chapter of the King series. The joys and sorrows of movie fans are not connected, but now we also have a common memory: Marvel Movie Universe. Thank you, Avengers.",
        "The ending of this great saga really reaches deep to tie up loose ends and make the ending a satisfactory, thirst-quenching resolution to what started so long ago-in a small cave somewhere-with a desperate Tony Stark and the birth of a hero.",
        "What an amazing film! I wouldn't change a thing about it. The film is very long but worth every minute. A good mixture of comedy and action.\n\nAdvice: go to the toilet before you watch it!",
        "The second the iconic Marvel intro began, I was crying buckets. By far the best super hero film of all time. A complete finish to the most epic saga. Bring two buckets... one for your popcorn and one for your tears.",
        "We have been waiting for this for so long since Iron Man started and the Avengers were created. A masterpiece that has undergone a decade in the making.",
        "Even though it has some slow scenes, I was really moved by the character building, how the story was elaborately planned, and the heartbreaks that we had to endure along the way. I must say, it had an epic and emotional ending we never thought we wanted.",
        "I've seen almost all of them, But I don't like every one, I'm the standard marvel black!",
        "Good movie but a bit long especially during the 2nd phase (could skip 30min ez) and the end is not as epic as Infinity was last year...harcore fans will absolutly love it for sure for other it's just a good ending.",
        "Good movie but lacks script writing. It lacks content.",
        "OMG! \"Avengers: Endgame\" is absolutely Action Packed, Amazing, Epic, Brilliant, Masterpiece, and it's way more fun and better than Infinity War, like every Audience and I thought it would be. It had all the action, humor, and had very emotional scenes. The Russo Brothers, did way better than Joss Whedon. Why? Because, it's \"A must see\" and a perfect Marvel Studios film, for the whole entire audience to watch, but I Can't tell you what happens, or what happens in the end or who's coming back to life, because in the end of \"Avengers: Endgame\", no one, and I mean no one, or anyone, can guess what's gonna happen :) And Now it's shattering Box Office Records around the World! :) I loved it 3000 :) and it's far better than the first Avengers movie, and Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Avengers: Infinity War.\n\nThank you, Marvel, Kevin Feige, The Russo Brothers, and most of all, Thank you, Stan Lee.",
        "One of the best movies I have ever watched ... \"Avengers : Endgame\" is the best Ending of 10 years of The MCU .. the movie was dramatic not just a superhero movie which the heros win at the end, No the movie has drama and the acting was too good from all the characters .. That's why I liked so much, It Isn't like any superhero film, It Was Epic !",
        "Don't jump on the \"All marvel movies are great and deserve Oscars\" bandwagon yet, because the truth is all of them are Nonsensical childish fan pleasers with no complexity and realism. It hasn't even been 2 years since Marvel peaked with this flick and every content they're releasing now is a watered down shadow of what the characters used to be, so they can introduce more politically correct characters. Don't heed to the pretenders that these movies are deep and profound because the larger they are, the harder they suck and fall.",
        "My favorite marvel film has always been Captain America:The Winter Soldier but this one tops it. Great film!!!",
        "All has been said, fanboys stop overrating your S***",
        "Avengers Endgame has everything you would want a superhero movie to have and also the best cast, with amazing scene, visual effect and will put tears on you",
        "Everyone shines in this movie. Directed to the fans of these 10 last years of Marvel movies. A thank you, beautiful, tragic, fun. The emotion stills my words just after seeing the movie. Have to see it twice again to do it justice.",
        "This movie, pretty much, had it all...great action and drama...heroic valor...and comedy, in all the right places... plus there were great cameos...it's long, but it doesn't seem as long as it is because the pacing is very good... definitely recommeneded.",
        "BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\"Nuf said\" -Stan Lee",
        "I don't believe on the people that have given this 1 star because this is one of the best mcu movie and the greatest movie in the world. I was the most anticipated movie of 2019. It is one of the best movie in the world.",
        "Watching this was so surreal. It was unlike anything the MCU has ever seen, and I mean that in a good way. If there was an option to rate this higher I would",
        "Let be honest here, after infinity war marvel really had a lot to live up to, and they simply set the bar to high. There were several missed chances to provide fans with a truly epic conclusion. The entire thing felt rushed. The story felt rushed and not well thought out. To be honest I'm just really really upset. I took part of the day off to sneak out and go see this movie without my wife because i was confident i would see it again with her, but i don't think i can sit through that again. It kinda felt like the last star wars, or the solo movie disney did. They simply ran out of gas. The take off was spectacular but there just wasn't enough gas in the tank to bring it home.",
        "When you bring a character in late and force them and their off screen agenda down our throat it is going to leave a bad taste. Say what you will but this is about the character and its rushed story.\n\nThe powers that be assumed all of us that like Marvel Pictures would slurp up the captain snowflake drivel. It will never happen. All the other actors had had enough too as was obvious during all the junkets.",
        "The movie started off really well but somewhere in the middle it just felt rushed. The already long runtime or maybe the fact that it just had too many minds working on it, the world may never know, it could've been better. Infinity war was the second best Marvel movie after Iron Man(the first one) in my opinion and Endgame although it's the end of an era it just felt it was lacking in a lot of places and that void that is left in our hearts by the departure of the Avengers might not yet be filled.",
        "This was the single greatest Marvel movie I've seen ever and it has everything that you could ever ask for in a finale.",
        "After watching this twice, I understood the story of Avengers: Endgame. The Avengers failed after the Infinity War. Never in their lifetime faced an incredible and inevitable enemy like Thanos. Josh Brolin delivers a badass Thanos. He is smart, he did the unthinkable, and he made it tough for our heroes to restore the loss. Whatever it takes was the Avengers motivation. Huge sacrifices must be taken. Seeing the Avengers rise from hopelessness and failure is the most amazing feeling in this movie. The huge price was delivered and this movie hands down is the best movie of 2019. The final battle makes it epic.\n\nThe Russo Brothers deliver a phenomenal film. I give them high praise for their direction and work to make this film the best. The actors and actresses are amazing, 22 movies in 10 years. All influenced into one movie. I love 3000.",
        "The best superheroes movie a end of era for marvel was very good",
        "Mind blowing movie I mean it was so good that we gave it a standing ovation. One of my favorite and Marvel has done a great job. Most people think Marvel is childish but it is actually a nice movie for all generations. You won't regret to watch it and it will 100% make a smile on your face.",
        "Everything I have been waiting for for the past 10 years and then some! Everything paid off in the final act of the movie. The greatest hour in superhero movies that will probably never happen on the big screen ever!",
        "Everything that's happened over the past 11 years has been leading to this, and it's all put together beautifully. In my opinion, there are 3 movies to rewatch before watching Endgame: Iron Man 1, Winter Soldier, and Infinity War.",
        "This movie is honestly the Empire Strikes Back of Marvel. A lot of movies aren't nearly as good. Firstly, the CGI, the action, and just the special effects on the heroes, they're top notch. Second, I know that this movie doesn't exactly have the action throughout because of the time travel plot, well there's a quite a bit of action scenes, but it gives us a enjoyable throwback to the old MCU movies and saves the big blockbuster action for the finale and there's nothing to be said of the finale except for one word: EPIC. Lastly, it really put a good use of the 11 year buildup of our heroes. And you really careabout all of them. And everyone does career-best performances. But the star of the show is RDJ. He's always been great as Tony Stark, but I don't think he was as good as he was in this movie. He honestly deserves an Oscar. And don't listen to haters of this movie please. Just watch it and enjoy it.",
        "Movie has a little bit too much comedy. I wish it kept the dark and serious tone throughout the film. Anyways, don't go in expecting a lot of action though. Doesn't really have action until the final 45 minutes. Movie is a mix of Inception, Back to the Future, and Infinity War.\n\nIt is a little bit too long though, and the first 40+ minutes were pretty slow. 8/10",
        "Undoubtedly this will not get published or heavily downvoted but in the interests of fairness here it is.\n\nA decent film, certainly not what was expected (the trailer is very, very misleading, which is a good thing in this case) however some characters were basically ruined for the sake of humour or that they couldn't be shoe-horned into the already overflowing roster, also there was in my opinion two kinda inescapably obvious flaws with the story which I won't spoil because honestly, I don't need to, I could hear the people sitting behind me and to my right say \"what? How?\" So I knew it wasn't just me overthinking it. The film is good, don't get me wrong, but it's not a \"10/10 omg I cried and laughed and what a masterpiece\" film that some of these reviews are saying it is.\n\nIt's better than most MCU films, but it's no Winter Soldier or Iron Man by any means.",
        "I don't understand why people give 10/10 ? cuz of drama ? it's avengers not shawshank i expected a real plan against thanos but time travel ? it's like they tried to write a thanos plan but they failed so they said \" okay let's do time travel \". gg wp",
        "I really liked the movie! Interesting , fascinating , flies by very quickly ! I love the Marvel line , each film as a separate art form ! I advise you!",
        "22 years with overs 11 movies and one epic ending,the MCU Deserves it all",
        "So predictable. There is nothing is this movie that explains people liking it. Just horrible, waste of time.",
        "This movie has been candidate to the Academy Awards for best picture.",
        "In marvel they can kill entire world with fingersnipping but in reality entire world don't know marvel. Film is too long to cover all stories background which needs knowledge of all films. But I don't know why sudden feminism. Marvel newbies find it very odd and boring and even end fight is not as great as promised and praised by few. Maybe marvel iron fans will love this but this film is not for all. It is meant and made for marvel fans and for their appreciation in which endgame succeeds",
        "Actually marvel did a good job with this movie Like actors and directors and visual parts It deserves a high rating.",
        "Russo brothers did an outstanding job. Every moment of the movie was great. Some scenes that are connected to first Iron man movie, previous Avengers movies and comics were so neat that it just makes you say \"WOW!!!\". Battle scenes are breathtaking. Ending is just perfect. Enjoy the movie and make sure to watch it couple more times.",
        "A nice fun movie for comic lovers and families to watch. Entertaining. This film is really good but not great. It is much better than Infinity War and miles over that nonsense we saw called Age of Ultron. In spite of how good this film is, this really did not need to be 3 hours long. Maybe 2 hours 20 minutes, most of the beginning scenes were out of place and even some of the ending scenes. The action scenes were good quality, one of the best I've scene in a movie. The acting wasn't great, but good. Although this movie's storyline isn't The Dark Knight/Rises, Shawshank Redemption, or Empire Strikes Back quality, I am confused as to why the rating is a 9. The storyline is pretty average. Again, fun movie to watch, but not a movie I would watch more than twice. I've grown up a comic fan and have loved super heroes before they were considered cool, but don't expect this movie to meet beyond your expectations. It is all hype. That said I give this movie an 8 at the most.",
        "Was it good? Of course it was.... Was it the best one in the series? Not even close... I was so excited for this movie and I left disappointed.",
        "Yes I gave this movie a ten ... like i gave to Good Fellas or Casino or Aliens or Terminator 2. Why ? Because this movie is one of the best actions movies ever... CGI ... Actors... Story Directors ... are incredible. Yes it cost 360.000.000 USD ... the most expensive movie ever ... but at least they made an incredible Superhero Movie ... Marvel understood from the beginning how to make an entertaining film. I like Zack Snyder but the DC Comics movies are just trying it to make it serious ... Come one we want fights and funny conversations like in the comics ... The Story might be not 100 % in line or believable yeah give me a break we are talking about Superheros here ... they can do anything :) I am now waiting for the 4 Bluray Box for the Avengers and the 3 Bluray Boy of Captain America ... For me it ended now .... Great experience ... and I think it will take mabe some decades before they can do somethng like this again.",
        "Picks up 22 days after the climax of Infinity War with Iron Man and Nebula stranded in space and the others baffled as to what to do next. Antman re-emerges and they consider a new possible way forward.\n\nFabulous conclusion, full of wit, sadness and wonder. Everyone is great, the effects are to die for and a very well produced line is drawn under phase 3 - let's hope phase 4 is half as good.",
        "I can't believe I wasted 3 hours of my life on this movie",
        "Good movie. A good ending to a great saga Loved the acting and direction was superb but the length of the movie was tediously long. the movie fails to keep the tempo. The character arch of some were strangely distorted. overall a great movie. loved the ending. Tony Stark, Captain America, thor, Hulk, Black widow and Hawkeye will always remain in our hearts.",
        "Overall its a good movie and may be an okay finale, it seems like the Seinfeld finale, after a great run a disappointing end, the movie story didnt have fluidity and seems the writers just wanted to finish all endings quickly rather than the smooth flow like in infinity war",
        "Ehh it was predictable and the last one was better",
        "I have no words for how bittersweet this movie was. I'm not in the habit of spoilers so have no fear this review has none of them. I can say you'll be amazing, you'll laugh and of course you'll cry..but for me I'm kinda upset in a way like a bittersweet chocolate bar I really like but kinda I hate I ate way..lol. And I know these are fictional characters and I shouldn't be so invested but that's what Marvel and The Russo Brothers do..they have taken us on this journey with these characters and now it's like we're all hanging over this cliffside with them..not knowing where or how the journey will end knowing we probably won't looking away cause we love them. I just don't know if I can move on with the next phase.. theses dorks are my people and I think they outdone themselves this time.",
        "I've seen this 3 times now, and it's such a gift. As a lifelong comic book and movie nerd, I couldn't have asked for much more. Epic. Touching. So exciting.",
        "When I saw Endgame and Carol came on screen with her new haircut the gay in me actually moaned in the theater so loud my mom sitting next to me had to tell me to call down",
        "Being one of the best marvel movies does not means that this is one of the best movies of all time, not even the best superheroe film\n\nSorry fanboys but is the truth",
        "What a spectacular end of Avengers series by Marvel.. Perfect ending..Better than expected..Feeling sad because its a end of era.. Marvel U entertained us from past 11 year and now no more avengers .. Just feel the movie \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",
        "Unless your back to the future...stay the HELL out of time travel. It has so many loopholes...ruins the story...and is just a a device to use, when your too lazy to think about anything else. I am so goad time travel exists now...to hopefully find a way to go back in time to before I watched this movie. Also screw tony stark and his wife peppa potts.",
        "A disappointing end to an era of movies that started very well only to get worse over time. There are a few that are worth looking at as pure entertainment, and some make no sense to watch. Some parts are good and interesting, but the film is unfortunately mostly disappointing, from the whining Thor who is absolutely unbearable in this film, to the Hulk who was turned into a crappy creature from some sitcom. There was really no need for that. Parts of the film are completely unnecessary and pointless and they degrade the overall impression of the film. The special effects are of course good, yet this is a high-budget film, but that's just not enough. Too bad, this could have been a lot more than a mediocre movie with dazzling special effects.",
        "I had very high hopes from this one. but it was a big dissapoinment. They should have come up with better idea than time travel and no action at all. Last 8 mins action is not enough.",
        "All I can say is that I've never been into the comics but this sets such a high bar maybe I missed out? I'm one who would rather watch the movie it's safe to say. Seriously this is the ultimate escapist celluloid brilliance I've witnessed in over 50-years of movies. This film is the masterpiece of the genre. What a cast too. I think after some settling I will actually feel inspired to go through the entire franchise again knowing this carrot is at the end. No criticism of any kind can I think of. Truly excellent to the point even if you're never seen anything Marvel you should step up and see Avenger's\" Endgame.",
        "I personally preferred most of the other movies. It was just way too predictable and not that funny.",
        "Best movie ever, really? Is it the only movie you have seen or even the only marvel movie you have seen? 10/10's are just not being serious. Far too boring , comic movies must be fun and this film is light on that.",
        "Amusing, but don't expect too much. The previous movie was much better.",
        "The first half of the movie have some slow and boring scenes, not an end game type movie, missing action and the power start, the second half and the last 40 minutes marvels best, can watch multiple times only for thanos",
        "I have to admit I enjoyed this film but maybe my expectations were too high. I found the conclusion to be disappointing on many fronts. He did the resolution for three of the characters. It was unnecessary and out of character but I won't go into spoilers. The russos ended on a sour note but it was a hell of a run. I'm afraid the MCU will descend into sjw nonsense from here on out. So, goodbye MCU I love you!",
        "This is a kitchen sink movie, in that you get everything but the kitchen sink in it! The three hours flies by mostly due to the fact that the action rarely stops. It's a movie filled with laughs and tears and goodbyes. A couple of scenes seemed shoe horned in to appease the folks clamoring for more \"Woke\" moments. Those scenes aside, most of this epic movie is solidly put together and wonderfully presented. Without spoiling anything, I was scratching my head at some of the logic behind science in the movie that goes against every thing any movie viewer has ever seen, but I have a policy of throwing logic to the wind on super hero movies. What's the point when you have people flying and teleporting across space. I've read this movie is a love letter to fans of the MCU. I'd agree with that, and would add that if it was a love letter, Robert Downey Jr. signature would be at the end, in the center, and slightly larger than anyone else.",
        "Avengers Endgame is a masterpiece! The Russo brothers have nailed this epic conclusion to the Infinity Saga. This movie exceeded all of my expectations and so much more... I'm really happy with the how to Russo brothers handled the aftermath of the decimation and how the remaining avengers move on from this devastating event.\n\nOverall, the movie had amazing visual effects, epic soundtracks, amazing cast and this movie is a must-watch for all marvel fans..\n\nLoved every second of the movie and give it a 10/10\n\nThank you Marvel, the Russo brothers, the cast and the crew of endgame for making this movie my favourite comic book movie ever!",
        "Legendary film F F Fkfdjxjjdjj ddjdjdbe. Dbdjndjx mdmdd dmd dk dkd djdn D",
        "After experiencing the epic phenomenon Avengers Infinity War we were wondering what would happen & now that this sequel is here Avengers Endgame in every way is truly a phenomenal MCU Movie in decades & is a perfect set up to some upcoming projects from the MCU in the future.",
        "This movie was epic! I felt soooo many emotions and was so sad it ended. If they do other movies, idk how I will feel about someone else playing these characters.",
        "I had a blast watching this when it first came out, easily my favorite of the MCU films",
        "Loved every minute and it's a true masterpiece, it has all aspects of a successful movie, and the ending is wonderful, can't wish for a better end, will miss the Avengers so much.",
        "The story goes along with the battles and tough situations for the heroes after Thanos disqualified a lot of livig things. The final battle is beyond your expectives.",
        "This is not just movie, it's beyond movie. It's the one movie that doesn't required any review, recommendations or feedback. Best comic book movie ever. MASTERPIECE! #endgame #dontspoiltheendgame",
        "The perfect ending. To a great franchise\n\nZhzhhbsbnznnsnsn.",
        "This movie marks the end of an era and it's one of those you remember forever, this was the first time I've cried in the cinema and I got a lot of chills watching this, the movie is greatly done with amazing special effects. That ending is sad and beautiful at the same time, hands down the best Avengers movie!",
        "Watched this movie last week .I have to say that i did'nt like this one as much as i liked Infinity wars.I found it to be predictable in parts plus it was way too mushy for me in certain bits.There was way too much hype for this ,i came out of the theatre pretty disappointed .",
        "It was straight up a huge disappointment, and a really bad ending to a great saga",
        "That is the sign of a good movie. From start to finish your basically glued to it. And the humor in it is better than expected. The action and special effects are above avg. Good story line to follow the previous movie.",
        "Omg, marvel smashed it with his one, such a great ending even tho I cried and hated it in my heart (lol), buf after a bit of time and understanding the impact it had. It was for the best. Hope to see the greatest character come back some day or get his own movie.",
        "This can only be described as perfect. What a ride and what a beautiful story. It's simply the most beautiful masterpiece in cinema history.",
        "What is there to say about the ending to a film series that defined an entire new chapter of Hollywood? It's difficult to process everything that happens in Endgame, but that's to be expected from a film of this scale. It's enthralling and unforgettable - get ready to feel EVERY emotion!",
        "This is a fantastic movie. Everyone must love it. This is the most Sci-fi film I have ever seen. Here, all the avengers went to past to fetch the infinity stones that were caught by thanos (in present). From the past, the avengers got the infinity stones and they came in the present to fight with thanos. In the war of thanos and avengers, at last Iron man get dies with thonos, which is the most heart breaking seen of the movie.",
        "The movie was amazing for me and all other fans of Marvel for sure. If you ain't a fan it doesn't mean that you won't like it. You'll enjoy it due to comedy, action and something more. You might like something else from the movie. It depends on you. I think it would be worth spending your time on watching it. Thank you, Nitin H.",
        "One of my favorite marvel movies. All the superheroes in one movie has been the made this the most thrilling movie yet.",
        "Brilliant movie. What a climax! They did a good job in concluding the Avengers series. 10 on 10! Must watch. I laughed, was speechless and even cried.",
        "I loved endgame (the first time at least) I think it was the best ending for the 3rd phase of the mcu. I'm really excited for phase 4 of the mcu already",
        "So emotional especially if you've been invested in the series. Cried countless times, a masterpiece if you're a long time fan",
        "Like every Marvel movies it has future'past experiences. Infinity war seemed more like a prequel. The perfect mixture of Avengers 1,2 and 3. And trailer says it all. \"Endgame\" as the name says it has a great ending. Thank you for the memories RDJ",
        "By the time Avengers: Endgame (2019) still fresh in my mind I can say that this movie is one of the best well spend 3 hours in my life and the best conclusion to the first chapter in the MCU history. I can't wait to see how they outdo all of this in the next 10 years",
        "Epic closure of the sequel which sets the bar really high for any future Marvel productions. Incredible plot.",
        "The movie has a slow two hour start. The time travel thing was a bad idea. The end was good and saves the movie from receiving a six rating.",
        "There is not a story better than Avengers Endgame Nuff said!",
        "Exciting, fun, solid and beautiful, worthy of Oscar",
        "I avoided seeing this movie for the longest time. I just watched it - Jan 3, 2021.\n\nI have to say they did a very nice job. Fitting in aspects from all previous movies nicely. Excellent acting from everyone. You could tell how many of these actors really clicked over the previous movies as the chemistry was really nice here.\n\nI was surprised how many emotional scenes there were. If you were a fan of the previous movies you will enjoy this.\n\nThe ending battle scene is absolutely awesome. It's exactly the type of comic book grand finale/battle you would expect.\n\nA truly worthy ending to fantastic story.",
        "Endgame, the continuation of Infinity War. It was one of the most expected films I've ever waited to see. Like Infinity War it triggered so many emotions, even more. Sadness, anger, joy and many more... The greatest Blockbuster of our time x3000.",
        "Such high hopes for this movie after infinity war but was such a let down. Only real action was the last hour of the movie and even then it wasn't anywhere as decent as the action in infinity war. I understand the need to bring the story to a close but it could have been done with better editing out unnecessary storyline within the 1st hour, so dragged! If it wasn't for the ending action scenes I would have given it a 5! Last 15 minutes is also slow and 15 minutes of credits (no post credit scene). So it's 2 hours 40 of the movie and approx 20 minutes credits. Compare a massive franchise like this with lots of the rings trilogy and this is not the mega finale as hoped as return of the king is a proper send off!",
        "This could've been sooo much better, some great scenes and then the horrific route taken with the characters of Thor and Hulk! Some nice touches and fight scenes but left disappointed. Totally agree with so many others that infinity war was the better movie.",
        "Completely overrated movie, infinity wars was a great and bold movie, it built a lot of expectations on an interesting and smart sequel but End game was quite disappointing, I was really expecting a more interesting movie with some twists, but nothing, it was predictable and bland and it didn't make a lot of sense either.",
        "Finally it's here. But not the finale we deserve. The story is quite thin, the action is scarce and the 3+ hours is too much. The humor saves the movie. Without humor it would have been a total disaster. This should have been the finale that would be epic. Looks like they where going for the quick money instead of waiting to perfect it. Sad to see it end like this.",
        "My friend,isn't watch any other marvel before,she still cry.Then you can know the movie not just is normal hero movie. The movie has lot of twist that in sometime you can't direct.The character's emotion protrey is good.Beside the actor is pect and the story is good too.It don't have any strange event or reason to do that.After you watching it,you will still have lot of feeling you can let them go.Go to see the movie to have amazing experience!",
        "You didn't saw that coming. If you don't leave the theater crying there is something really wrong with you",
        "Every penny worth to watch! <3\n\nA great and accomplished emotional roller coaster story. Got me into tears many times, and constant gave me goosebumps <3",
        "I was just expecting more action... I was relatively bored for the first 2/3 of the movie.",
        "Wow....this is a INSANE MOVIE!!!!! Especially because iron man dies!",
        "In all honesty there is no recollection of any Marvel movie that can and did deliver on the full rollercoaster of emotions. I mean yes there is the strongest of possibilities you will cry in an Avengers movie.\n\nEndgame I'm sure you don't have to be told is set after Infinity War, infact five years after, we see how the surviving gang have been impacted by the loss of their friends from the actions of Thanos. From there they take us on a journey of how they can fix their wrong. You wont even recognise that three hours have passed as it keeps you fully engaged.\n\nWithout giving too much away you will see how the next adventures may transpire and why there is a Guardians 3 coming. Really if you're a fan of the franchise you're going to see this anyway, so....... There will be no spoilers here (#dontspoilendgame).",
        "I'll keep it simple,\n\nThis movie is good. I give it a 7,4 but IW was better (I give IW a 8,9). The first half of the movie is kind of slow, the second half is faster.\n\nYou need to have seen a couple of marvel movies before you can understand what's going on in this movie. Or you have to have read the superheroes backgrounds and/or powers.",
        "If you are a fan of the mcu you will love this movie even if your not you might still love it, it concludes the story that was being told since 2008 in a satisfying way. It is more than a movie this is an experience especially in theaters",
        "The entire movie, as entertaining as it is, seems as though everyone involved was ready to be done with it all.\n\nThe plot is unfulfilling. The inclusion of several characters seems forced.\n\nThe action is satisfying, and everyone will find someone to cheer for.\n\nWe're meant at the end, to weep for the grand conclusion. I weep for what could have been.",
        "I can't believe it, why are people is giving this a 1/10 it's a Masterpiece and original people theses days just don't have good taste on movies they just go like other overrated movies the ending is so amazing",
        "One of the main reasons why this movie is only a 7 is because of the super high expectations and how excited I was for this. So for me it was kind of a let down but not just because of the hype. Personally the pacing was just God awful, and it's not because it's a little slow to start, but it's the massive amount of jumps the film takes. I can watch slow movies with a build up, but when everything changes so quickly and then goes back to slow repetitively it creates an frustrating feeling. The movie also has many unexplained plot holes, with most movies this is fine, but when you need to know the details (which are very important for marvel films) then it hits the plot a lot. I also feel like the movie tried too hard to be emotional. There was no need for the way it ended or the sad spots in between. Not to mention, the cgi on captain marvel looks great. Still a good better then average movie, but not the best ever.",
        "Just go watch it I promise you won't regret it\n\n\n\nP.S. don't wait for the after credits scene there are none",
        "A great film over all, it does run just a little too long and I (personally) fell like some character growth was destroyed towards the end. But still enjoyed the experience.",
        "This was not the Grand Final i expected. It is just a Fan pleaser movie for the last Decade of MCU Films. I wanted to give it a seven, however I do understand why it was done this way, so it gets an eight. It was too much on feelings, to much slapstick ..anyway Homecoming is near to end phase 3 technically and I think it will be the better film overall.",
        "Strongly believe that infinity war was a way more superior movie, with way more memorable scenes and a buildup to an impactful ending. While endgame incorporates all the characters in the story, it makes me feel less emotion for any of them. It was not a waste of money, no doubt, but it felt like the movie was being carried by audience feels for individual characters more than an exciting plot.",
        "The first hour heavily relies on comedy, but once it picks up the pace, it really is entertaining. Solid story with amazing action sequences.",
        "... if you were a real marvel fan\n\nThis endgame is a masterpiece, really what true fans want from this franchise and really entertaining, only wished it was longer!!\n\nEverything from acting, story, fight scenes, suspense, twists etc. It's all up to my expectations and to what I am looking to see when I go to the movies to watch the MCU\n\nI watched this before it even airs worldwide as I have won a avant-premiere ticket, it surely was worth it and I am proud to be one of the firsts that have watched the movie before it airs!\n\nI just wish there was more!",
        "The first 2 acts dragged out too much, they could cut about 15 min. But the worst part is that the 3rd act is predictable, but with great moments. I really thought there would be some kind of surprise, but there weren\u00b4t. I wished I loved this movie so bad, but I was so disappointed with the film. It had great moments but also much meh moments.",
        "SO GOOOOOOD it has every emotion in one sadness, happiness, joy, it has everything there were a few scenes that were a bit cringe but other than that a near perfect",
        "Endgame doesn't deserve a number score because it is just good, nothing more nothing less.",
        "Of all 21, this one was a tear jerker. I couldn't keep my tears in my eyes. What I call the first part of the movie was a bit slow, but it picked up for sure. I loved the way they brought back familiar characters from previous movies. They did an excellent job bringing back those individuals we thought we'd never see again. The ending fight was just the best, it was awesome, words can't explain. Just see it!!",
        "Pretty much 90% of the user reviews already say what I want to say so I'll keep it short. This movie was so much worse, in every way, than Infinity War. Which is a shame and it's not gonna get a low score because of how overrated it is, even though most people leave reviews saying how much they hated it. It just sucks that THIS is the ending to the decade long series we all grew up with.",
        "You can see how the story goes in first 10 mins Takes forever to finish",
        "Ten stars are all given to black widow, she is the greatest avenger! !",
        "I don,t care what anybody else thinks about this film. It is one hundred percent worth watching and I would highly recommend this film to any Marvel fan.",
        "Sobbed. So much to take in. No words. Gonna watch it a millionth time more these few weeks.",
        "The first 50 minutes set up the movie very well but the second act lacks urgency and focus. The movie comes to a halt and feels as if it's meandering between scenes, not knowing what to do and not being very entertaining. The movie is also highly predictable and somewhat ruins Thanos's character due to a strange character decision. Iron man is given a lot to work with, which is compelling, same with Hawkeye. The ending is somewhat satisfying but also cringe. Overall it is a fine movie, not offensively bad but certainly not as good as it's predecessor.",
        "No Spoilers review ?! I think it would be rude to ask for a more better version of this story..To be honest There is no satisfying ending.. it's always what was best possible way.. Avengers End game makes you realise that your superhero whom you always considered Mentality of steel and Heart full of Power...They are also Human They deserved the life they wanted...And this movie is perfect capturing of what they could do with so less time left on their side...This movie is brilliant, unparalleled dedication..I am happy as well as sad to see this End of an era...But Eventually everything comes to end..So is the movie... Thank you Avengers ! For making our virtual and real world both happy \ud83d\ude0a",
        "Probably the best 3 hours in movie history. A cinematic experience everybody should experience. Exceeds expectation, 'nuff said.",
        "It is made with great CG and it does not make me bored even though it runs for three hours. However, it is better to watch all of marvel films. I did not do it so I could not get some point.",
        "The best movie I ever watched. no words to tell.Pls rate 10 of 10",
        "Just 'marvel'ous. Blockbuster movie making at its zenith. The first movie that has properly lived up to its gargantuan hype.If u thought the pervious entry was the pinnacle, this one will put it to shame. All thanks to the Russo brothers and the wonderful actors who have lived their characters. If u miss this movie, don't visit the cinema hall again.",
        "Sometimes I feel like some IMDb trolls purposefully downvote something to keep overrated movies at the top of the all time list. I don't remember a movie matching and exceeding THIS big of hype. It's a great ending to a crapload of marvel movies. Makes you want to go back and watch all of them again. Plus when can you remember the last time you actually weren't sure if a character was going to die or if the good guys were going to win. If you didn't have at least a tad of doubt, you're in denial. Infinity War was a tiny bit better imo but they are both epic! Every movie is going to have plot holes if you sit there and pick it apart forever. Guaranteed you could claim plot holes in q documentary if you tried (these days i wouldnt doubt some idiot has). Good for you, you are so smart! No fooling you! Enjoy the entertainment and eat some popcorn. Let yourself enjoy life and dont worry about wanting to be pissed off/unimpressed all the time. My goodness. 10/10",
        "I didn't hate this the same as the Transformer franchise, or reboot of Star wars. Unfortunately they all are cookie cutter films, look, taste, feel the same, nothing really sets it apart. My 2 biggest issues with this film were did it really need to be 2 3/4 hrs long. I figure with a good film editor they could have clipped 25 min and not ruin the pacing, the second is Bree Larson. I just find her unlikable. Downey, Hemsworth great as always. Would love to see Hemsworth, take on the 007 role once Craig retires. Last cameo for Stan Lee.Endgame isn't a bad film, just nothing really special about it either. I can find more fulfilling ways to spend 2 3/4 hrs.",
        "It was good but IW was better. Reminds me of Kill Bill Vol 1, remember how good Volume 1 was, then they released Kill Bill volume 2 and it was anti-climactic and weak compared to the superior first movie. It does have some great scenes but they were few and far between. Movie had too much filler.",
        "All the people who have given a rating of 10 to this movie, I would ask IMDB to review if these are fake accounts. I know it's not a rating on 1/10 but then I had to balance the odds. There was simply no real wow moment (except for 1-2 minutes in the end). Week logic, poor surprise element, character mismanagement, sexist/feminist scenes, are some of the many flaws in the story line. The directs blew it big time...",
        "It's hard to criticize Endgame, given its enormous success. It certainly had its moments, the scene with Hawkeye and Nat was incredible, and the closing scene was really cool, it really made the viewer feel like he was part of the Marvel pantheon. But I wouldn't be in any hurry to see it again, and I watched Endgame 4 or 5 times. I've heard the latest Spider-Man gets the Marvel universe revved up again, so that will be fun.",
        "I can't review it, cannot be described with words, experience it yourself on theatre guys! It's really THE ENDGAME! Whatever the expectations i had, it had gone even beyond that whatsoever!!! Just watch it without knowing any spoilers! 11 years of hardwork paid off, GG Marvel!",
        "There are three movie tropes that have been played out to death: 1. It was all a dream. 2. Child/parent or man/woman switching bodies. 3. Time travel. Endgame cops out via door #3. It also got way too cute with Hulk's character, and way too emotional with Ironman/Tony Stark's character. The film felt like the writers/producers were either on speed or had ADHD or both. Key characters simply appeared, with no development whatsoever, most notably Captain Marvel. The net result was more like those things they have at carnivals called \"Spin Art\", where you just squeeze paint onto a spinning card, rather than real art.",
        "Was not expecting anything like that from marvel so weak",
        "I like the 2nd half a lot, but the first half was so boring I literally almost fell asleep.",
        "If you felt underwhelmed the first time. I suggest you see it again",
        "It was good. Just like the last one. But it's not very different from any marvel movie. They have become repetitive and predictable . Many cliches",
        "RDJ is the only glimmer in a bland movie. Not worth the rating it got.. 5 at best.",
        "This was the ultimate movie! It was FANTASTIC. It is by far the best movie I've ever seen and to see the ultimate battle and everything, it reminded me of how it was once just a movie called 'Iron Man', and has its ultimate finale, the end of a extraordinary era. Don't listen to the negative reviews. This movie is brilliant.",
        "I went to watch this film with high hopes and it did not disappoint me. It has the usual Marvel humor but at the same time the seriousness as plot calls for it.\n\nI'm not an emotional person and rarely cried watching a film but this one put tears into my eyes. It is by far one of the best superhero films.",
        "Enjoyed the movie and liked it more when I watched it the second time. A little lengthy but has some great scenes especially for Marvel fans. Sad to know that no more Avengers movie! Gets a bit crowded with lot of superheroes at times.",
        "End of era. Worth watching. There is every thing which is required in a perfect movie. There is drama, action, emotion, every rhi\n\nThank you Stan Lee.",
        "This by far the best marvel movie I have ever watched, the emotions are strong, the battle was amazing, and when I watched it, i was shaking so much, and I couldn't breathe cuz of the fight scenes, and we lost some character's I won't say, but I cried!!, this movie is s must watch am telling you, it well be the best 3 hour and 2 mins of your life!",
        "The Russo Bro's should be commended by what they brought to the BIG SCREEN! this movie is GOLD! everything about it is non-stop fun, emotional thrill ride especially if you have followed the franchise for years. The tears will fall but the smiles will grow bigger than ever before. Some say 3 hours is too long but it's not long enough, I could spend forever growing with these Hero's and the wonderful actors portraying them, feel like a kid again and wishing I was a superhero! Heartwarming in all the right places. 10/10 my favorite movie of all time!",
        "Avengers endgame\n\nan action movie with a lot of amazing CGI This movie intended for teenager(13+) and adult consumers this movie is quiete amazing because the actor is popular actor like chris hemesworth and chris evans.\n\nThe movie is about a great hero team fight agaist a great villain team, their fight for their respective ideologies.\n\nOverall i think this is a great and awesome Action movie because the story and the CGI, 4,9 out of 5.",
        "This movie is one of the greatest movies ever made in history. The Russo Brothers did an amazing job on writing this movie. The movie was a great ending for the Infinity Saga, a lot of surprises throughout the whole movie. Not gonna spoil it for those who haven't watched it, but for those who have they will agree that this is the greatest and saddest movie in the MCU. The only thing that I wish was a little better was the whole time travel situation, but other than that the whole movie was a phenomenon.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is so epic and grandiose that it's impossible not to at least crack a smile during it's conclusion. Surprisingly though, the movie is at it's best when quietly self-reflecting on the journey of some of it's main characters. I'm impressed with how well the Russo's manage to make the story feel personal amidst a collection of characters and universe ending stakes.\n\nSeeing this on opening night with a cinema full of people laughing (and some crying) was a rare experience. When the credits finally hit, a friend turned to me and said 'it's the end of an era.' Nothing quite like what Kevin Feige and the Russo's have pulled of here has been done before, and I'm unsure if it will ever be done so well again.",
        "This is a worthy follow up, one of the most action packed, emotional, and well made movie in such a long time! Every actor is at their BEST! And when a scene hits hard, it REALLY hits hard. Great Effects are also showcased throughout this film. Their is a reason that this movie is blowing up, because fortune favors the bold!\nBohemian Rhapsody",
        "Truly a very satisfying film for all MCU fans, it is a film that perfectly connects most if not all the past 21 movies and is able to still please fans by adding various comic book references.",
        "The pacing in this movie is flawed. The humour is forced. But this finale is fitting and satisfying",
        "First half of movie is very slow, and humor lacking for a marvel movie.. second half is definitely better, but still does not live up to hype",
        "As we all know infinity war was so good and we all expected that endgame will be a movie higher than infinity war standards but it failed instead it was slow and depressing movie expect the last 30 mins of the movie.",
        "Mediocre Revamp of old stuff, waste of time, okay ending.",
        "For a fan who waited 11 years for this movie,Its a treat.Some are questioning about the ending but for a hardcore fan it was the most satisfying ending.Well done Russos, Brilliant writing, Masterpiece acting and justice to every character of the MCU.Some will be missed and MCU is changed now. Most epic end to The Infinity Saga. Love you 3000.",
        "After Infinity War I was waiting for marvelous final in End Game, but Marvel surprised me in negative way. They finished one the greatest franchise ever as drama and tragedy. They added so many dialogues that some people has been falling asleep. After dynamical Infinity War they gave us a so slow motion film. And finally, that what they did with Captain America it's a disaster for time theory!",
        "There are so many ways that the movie could have gone. But it is chosen to be this way. So the climax should not be criticised. The story is completed with no proper explanation for the rest of the avengers. Other avengers are not given importance in most of the places. Don't go to the movie if you know the spoilers. My experience has been spoiled by my friends.",
        "I've watched infinity wars at least 10 ten times, why because there is some cool stuff to watch. I can tell you now I wont be watching end game again.\n\nIt's ok but when the best part is Thor & Co instead of a new galactic threat you know they've screwed up.\n\nAnd boy the cheese was insane! Yeah some of it is genuinely sad, but I want more action in a 3 hour Marvel movie.\n\nI won't get started on Danvers boy we were sold short on her, like really short.\n\nSo much BS in this movie, reminded me of Transformers. Nuff said.",
        "When I walked out of the theatre I was really pleased with what I had seen( not a 10/10, but a good 9). But the more I thought about it the more weak points I could spot. There were some scenes that made me feel very angry, like all the stuff they have done to my favourite hero Thor. It was funny at first but later it just got on my nerves and made me (and all other fans of him) aggressive. There were also some scenes where the writers just found conclusion that were too easy compared to the problems that had been there. The movie also had some holes in its plot and things that just didn't seem very logic. But the start was great and all in all Marvel delivered very well. All in all it was a very good and enjoyable movie with some very emotional moments.",
        "Brie Larson is simply bad, somewhere between terrible and bland. She's the worst thing about this movies and if it weren't for the not only great but incredibly charismatic cast she'd have definitely tainted this movies. That said, watch it.",
        "One of the best avengers movies ever, with Thanos and all this is what all the movies have been leading to and the finale is great! The visuals are on another level. Some sad disappointing moments but that's how the story goes. You need to watch this absolutely if you are a Marvel or superhero fan!",
        "It was an epic, funny & emotional conclusion to the 11 years of the MCU. It's probably one of the most 'comic booky' film next to Spider Verse.",
        "Awsome Movie Great ending.i was surprised when all the avengers were gathered in one place.But it has a emotional ending.I Love You 3000 IRONMAN !",
        "What a brilliant finale to a wonderful saga, the infinity war saga will surely go down as one of the great cinematic achievements of all time. Avengers Endgame brings together all the characters we have grown to love and finishes the saga in a spectacular way. WHATEVER IT TAKES",
        "I'm still angry, I can't summarize in words how horrible and desperate this movie is, it really seems incredible to me that it exists.\n\nReally, everything about civil war was silly, I never thought it could get worse, I'm sure everyone at some point saw the memes about how horrible Captain America was in the MCU unlike other universes, do you know that I have post traumatic stress because of the stars and stripes dudebro of the mcu? I hate him! The end of this movie is so selfish and hypocritical that makes me sick, everything is special effects lights and colors, just to cover the creative inability of the \"genius\" who wrote this garbage\n\nIT'S A SCAM, you ruined YEARS of preparation with this ridiculous nonsense with thousands of plot holes, you don't deserve to make a single movie more in your life.",
        "No words...absolutely incredible, THE best way to end the whole series. Watching all the movies to finish with this, every single hour was worth it, hats off to Marvel \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd",
        "It was a good movie but there just too much hype surrounding it. I'm giving it 10 stars because of the cast.",
        "This movie have fantastic effects and I love its music.",
        "Like I said when I reviewed the last film, Infinity War, the Avengers seem to get better with each film (and longer it seems). The Russo brothers have become great storytellers over the last few years, and have been great at keeping the story secret. This film is the culmination of more than twenty films over the past eleven years, and it is extremely epic!\n\nThere are some twists and turns in this film that you might not see coming, but are essential to the Avengers story-line. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll love this chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I definitely see this film up for multiple Academy Awards in 2020, maybe even Best Picture; its that good.",
        "Boring characters, boring dialogue, good plot. Very overly dramatic, and also a lot of annoying product placement.",
        "Overall a good movie, felt like Infinity War and two previous Avenger movies were better, not as rushed. There were many holes in the internal story for Endgame, could have been pushed out to two 2-hour movies to help fill in some questions.\n\nIn general I was pleased but without giving away spoilers and movie details it's a movie to check out for all fans and want a good 3-hr experience at the theatre.",
        "An experience you'll gonna remember forever and watch again and again.",
        "I think the movie had been better if the Hulk had more fighting scenes in it other than his acting like a multiple PhD holder. And did they really have to create an obese Thor? I didn't really see the purpose for this transformation, if I could call it that. I just felt like the movie could have been better it they included more scenes with the \"resurrected\" heroes leading up to the last battle scene...",
        "Before the covid-19 pandemic, i watched avengers endgame in brazilian theaters. i literally got surprised when i realized it was 3 HOURS!!!! I recommend you to watch (but try not to sleep due to the 3 hours).",
        "Even though infinity war was better this movie was still amazing. I like everything about this movie! Even the time travel part which is considered quite lame. And for some reason I can only see 1 star ratings, just WHY!",
        "Russo Brothers gave the GENERAL audience exactly what they wanted. I would've not changed a thing to make the money they did. But if I had the talent of a Martin S. or Christopher N. this would have been better than infinity war (which was amazing!!). Cookie cutter storyline with untimely comedy. Too much comedic relief with poor dialogue and horrible storyline. Thanos seems to be a typical bad guy whereas in infinity war there was much depth to him...you could almost sympathize with him. A lot of Easter eggs if you like them. If youre a sheep you will love this movie. If you think for yourself and looking for a rich cinematic storyline that can keep you focused, this film would give the same enjoyment as Toy Story",
        "This movie past over and beyond any expectation. Don't miss watching it..... will definitely watch it again and again. \"Endgame\" The name fits perfectly. Total respect",
        "I personally have not been a fan of the avengers since the russo brothers took over. The acting in this film was like watching a middle school play. No emotion from anyone except jeremy renner and rdj. Way too long and the plot was just stupid, i think this goes to show huge budget definitely doesn't make a amazing movie.",
        "Avengers Endgame is the best MCU movie ever. It truly justifies the end of Infinity Saga",
        "Such a beautiful way to end such a fantastic series...or, rather, to end this chapter. Marvel has really outdone themselves and no other film could put that many avengers/superheroes on one screen and make it that good. I hope you haven't spoiled the movie for yourself if you are at all hesitant...whether it be fear of disappointment or not wanting to sit there for 3+ hours. Anyone that has kept up with all the movies will be blown away. Thank you Russo Brothers for making such a beautiful film.",
        "It's truly the end of the Infinity Stones Saga and it felt like as tears where pouring out of my eyes at the last scenes. Everything was tied up and perfect. It was brilliant. The movie itself was a roller coaster of emotions. Everyone was cheering and then crying on the next scene. It was crazy. But it was full of love and humane. It was everything it needed to be.",
        "I just came back boi , nothing to say im speechless to the bone! All what i can say , \"expect the unexpected\" stay strong my dear MCU fans because #whateverittakes ! Idk what to do with my life anymore , thank you for reading this! i shall go cry in bed bye",
        "I love superhero movies. So consider this a genre I truly enjoy and I review this title considering it's not art; it's entertainment. And in that sense, it's emotional, exciting, dramatic, action packed with the perfect amount of humor. It's no wonder it's the most anticipated superhero movie of all times, and no wonder why it has grossed so much. The movie promised to be awesome and was an understatement. If you like superheroes like me, you're gonna love it. Never before had so many heroes appeared together and, finally, working as a team. Now; to all of the people who expected an art movie, of course you didn't like it. It's an action film with amazing special effects and awesome action scenes and fabulous characters.",
        "This is a superhero movie. It doesn't deserve a 9.3 rating. Better than Godfather? Shawshank? Are you kidding me?\n\nIt belongs at 7-8. Rated 6 to adjust for voter stupidity.",
        "What a wonderful movie\ud83d\udc4cWe are just glued to every scene with excitement",
        "Movie Review will be this blog's first film review. This is an event film that took us to an entirely new level. This film is an exploration of the heroes' choices. It's a tale of good and evil. There are heroes, and then there are superheroes.\n\nMy previous review of Avengers: Age of Ultron was a pretty clear thumbs up. There are things that will stay with me for a long time, and Avengers: Endgame is not one of them.\n\nThere were a few things I didn't like when I saw Avengers: Age of Ultron.",
        "Good but nowhere near as good as people are saying, it's just the same as all the other superhero movies really nothing special.",
        "How is this a good movie? I don't know. Story is very predictable. Jokes are not funny. I liked the other movies but this is one just bullsh**. Simple entertainment and not the best movie of the year.",
        "Nothing to say about this movie...go and watch..\ud83d\ude42",
        "Great film! Loved it! Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely fantastic! Brilliant actor!",
        "Nice movie, one of the most memorable movie for myself This movie intended for teenager(13+) and adult consumers this movie is quiete amazing because the actor is popular actor like chris hemsworth and chris evans.\n\nThe movie is about a great hero team fight agaist a great villain team, their fight for their respective ideologies.\n\nOverall i think this is a great and awesome Action movie because the story and the CGI,",
        "I like the bit where the back of his hand lights up different colours",
        "I think that it felt like a long film and it really had a predictable ending. Although the film felt long it also felt rushed there was a real lack of thought that went into this film as it really didn't seem to excite me. Generally I would say that the cinematography was poor and the acting was ok at best. For the amount of money Marvel have they really did really make a quality film.",
        "The storyline, plot, action, adventure, theory and everything in this movie is just soo good. You want even recognize what is CGI and what is real. And hats off to Marvel CGI team at that. And what I like the most about this movie is the inspiration you get from every character in the movie. I don't have enough words to describe how great this movie is. This movie is a bomb, and it's explosion sound is gonna mess with DC for sure. Death to DC ! Marvel Rules !",
        "The film once again managed to include all emotions, just like infinity war did. At the beginning it was not what I was expecting, and from I've gathered this has caused many people to disregard the whole film, but the fact they tried something different makes it unique. The film still reached a point where the whole tone flipped and this is where it became even better. This is the only film I have been to see that has made the audience applaud, that must show how these films have been able to create such a connection with the MCU community to the characters.",
        "From a comic fans perspective this may be a good movie, at least the last hour, but for an admirer of cinema it is a great disappointment. The first two hours are expendable. The Russos try to be schmaltzy like Spielberg and funny like Waititi without having either of their chops and so they fail badly. They may do certain visual things really good but overall it seems to be a too big to succeed idea, to try and tie up every single storyline. I may also add that a lot of really stupid stuff happens that takes you out of the movie. Bad timing of mediocre jokes and some ridiculous mistakes. The pay off for the soapy stuff comes way too late. This is a not a great movie, unfortunately.",
        "I loved it, definitely my top 3 favourite movies and number one best marvel movies recommend watching!",
        "I had huge expectations after infinity war. This is moving was totally overrated and I couldn't get why they are trying to make 3 hour long.",
        "The movie is a masterpiece, even that the first and second act are very slow, the movie catches you and makes you wait for the third act to arrive, and my man when it arrives... you hit the palm of such incredible that it is. And it ends with mastery, giving an epic end to a great circle that began in 2008. I recommend this movie to all who are fans of superheroes. Congratulations MARVEL, you got it.",
        "Simply Awesome movie, nice character execution... amazing CGI.",
        "Honestly I found the first two hours to be pretty boring. A lot of it seemed unnecessary and drawn out to me but the final hour definitely picked up and was amazing. I was close to giving this a 7 but the end definitely had me emotional which never happens to me so clearly it had an effect on me! Great performances by RDJ and Chris Evans. Not so great performance by Scarlett Johansson though. Everyone else was good although Thor's issues were kind of too much after a while.",
        "This is the only way this marvelous, compelling, heroic story could end.",
        "Really really enjoyed watching Endgame. Captain Marvel is a distant memory. Despite Brie Larson being featured in Endgame it was only in a couple of scenes so it wasn't too bad. Endgame is incredibly sad, sometimes funny but very entertaining. Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Karen Gillan steal every scene their in. Will definitely watch again. Hopefully in phase 4 Captain Marvel will take a back seat just like Endgame.",
        "#New York city.. This movie is very good, there is no mistake in it. but some moment is missing in this movie I wanted to see a single fight between iron Man and thanos. Also with the main character of MCU. but overall it's a good movie and I love 3000 and special thanks for Russo brother and Stan Lee..",
        "Being the final chapter of Avenger series expectation was very high. Especially because of the superb success of the earlier chapter, \"The Infinity War\" which was undoubtedly a joy to watch. Since the bar was set so high it was not that easy for the movie makers to surpass the hype. Thus in the final chapter makers lack the finesse . There are flaws as the movie was very slow in some parts and it was very lengthy too. Moreover, though it's all fictitious but still the \"Time Machine\" concept looked pretty ordinary. The Iron-Man tragedy was also pretty dramatic and illogical. Otherwise the movie does well. So overall.......... not upto the mark. Expected a lot!!!",
        "I think they could have made it better. Overall still a good watch. It is fun and a good spectacle, but storyline could have been better.",
        "Just Awesome. An epic conclusion of an epic storyline. Makes you both happy and sad. One of the best superhero movies ever.",
        "To make it short (the movie was to long already): Infinity War was better, more entertaining and held up to it's expectations.\n\nThis one just didn't do it for me. And I can't stress this enough: It was waaaaay to long.",
        "The Best Marvel Movie Ever... .............................Nuf Said- Stand Lee",
        "An epic finish of The Infinity Saga. Great movie, great story, emotional movie etc. Congratulations to all Cast & Crew you guys did a great job and specially to Robet Downey Jr. Mr Kevin Fiege and The Russo Brothers you guys are the best!",
        "This movie may not have lived up to many of your expectations but when you really get down to it and listen to the whole of the movies all 22 of them and then watch this you will come to see it's perfect it stands by its roots and also reshapes what we believe is possible from the marvel movies no spoilers bu here but there cant be life without death right.",
        "No spoilers at all just go and watch this immensely epic culmination to the saga. Truly breathtaking. Just wow.",
        "Marvel has completely taken over the film industry, and the addition of this film will speed up that process even more. This film is enjoyed the most when the audience is knowledgeable of the marvel cinematic universe and it enhances the emotions of the audience due to the bond forged through the commitment of watching all 21 films before Endgame. If someone were to ask me: \"Is it one of the best films you have ever seen?\" I would reply: \"It is the best film if all time, in its own way\" \"Its stands alone, away from every other film, because it is so different to anything i have ever watched before.\"",
        "This film is an action film is very cool, when i watched this film i was constanly amazed by the acting of the actors in the film. The storyline that marvel fans have been waiting for in this film really makes us feel paid off after waiting a year from the previous film.\n\nIn my opinion, this film is very suitable for everyone to watch, but if it is too early then it should be accompanied by parents because this film contains elements of violent action. I Cried a lot after watching this movie because the middle to the end of this film is very emotional. Overall this film was crazy and I am willing to pay again if there is a film like this.",
        "No spoilers here. Story is unexpected and very original. If you thought you knew what will happen - well, you were wrong. First half is a bit slow, but still interesting, with all the small pieces coming together. Second part is full time action, almost as good as Infinity Wars, but a bit weaker in details. I do miss more of Dr. Strange more, but, on the other hand, Captain America was much better than expected. Humor was good, as always.\n\nOverall, this is a great movie and a decent ending to the saga. I think everyone will be satisfied.",
        "I watched this film yesterday and am still talking about how good it is - I laughed alot, I cried even more... I cannot understand how it got any less than a 9 in the user reviews. Absolutely stunning, beautiful end to a longggg series.",
        "I don't wanna spoil. honestly don't get over hyped. its not 10 star or 9. it deserves 8 Made for Marvel fans Not good as Infinity war but not bad for 3 hours Hilarious Thor! :D",
        "Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.",
        "Thor is spoiled in this movie.captain America is playing with Thor's hammer is likely very funny. Thanos performance is very powerful.storyline is also average.....when you going to theatre not excepted very much.",
        "In the long eleven years, it has grown up with us and made us what we are today.\n\nBecause of Captain America, we firmly believe in justice and kindness.",
        "ENDGAME is not what you're expecting, yet it's also exactly the impressive epic you're chasing. It takes our central heroes to new places and wraps up Marvel's decade-long journey so beautifully. The ending is emotionally overwhelming. I'm thankful to the entire team for giving us a special movie that will long live in our heart.",
        "The movie picks up faster than Infinity War, and the third act is one of the best moments in cinematic history!",
        "This is without a doubt the best,most emotional,sentimental,unexpected movie I've seen in my life It got me crying like a baby several times and smiling and emotional I mean wow what a way to finish a decade of making great movies,absolutely amazing",
        "I am speechless after watching this movie. Still having problem processing my thoughts after watching this movie. Some big changes were made and it will be very unacceptable to many hardcore MCU fans but everything must come to an end. The best ending to a decade of movie journey and end to an epic saga. Kudos to Russo brothers for gifting viewers this epic conclusion.",
        "It is the best movie I ever seen.this types of movies came once in a decked.the actor and actresses are give there best. I ONLY just wanted to say see this movie",
        "No spoilers except expect to cry at some point. Can't believe this phase is over. I love these movies.",
        "This movie was awesome. I liked it a lot. Of course the actors were awesome as well. The story was great. 3 hours sitting straight... well it wasn't seem that much for me. The Russo brothers did this very good. Respect for them. This whole cinematic universe is incredibly good. At some points you will get emotional :) And this movie is just a perfect ending. That's it.",
        "It's entertaining but not great. It's like all marvel movies nothing new.",
        "This movie is awesome! If you're a marvel fan you will enjoy this but then again you have probably already seen it. It's funny, emotional and clever. Yeah it is very long and most definitely could have been shortened but I just enjoy the characters so much I don't even mind.",
        "As an avid MCU Films fan, the Avengers: Endgame was by far THE BEST MCU FILM. For 10 years MCU has always delivered blockbuster movies and Endgame felt like their BIG BANG or LAST HURRAH; a trophy for all the 20 MCU films we have seen and loved.\n\nSitting through a 3-hour film never felt this quick but it was not short of satisfaction. It gave me all the feels, from laughs, to tears, to being in awe, to surprises.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't recommend watching this without watching all the MCU Films before this.\n\nAvengers: Endgame is WORTH THE HYPE. This is the finale that will stay with us.",
        "Didn't need a single other character in The marvel universe with as powerful as they made Carol Danvers aka Capn Marvel. She could have done everything solo, so this made this movie a 3 star instead of an 8. The movie lost all credibility by having a relatively new character for this series fly to the rescue. Boring....",
        "They definitely could've condensed this film into around 2hrs. The first two hours were filled with a bunch of chatter that didn't do anything but fill in time. As well as the last hour like everyone said, same ol stuff.",
        "When they started the MCU 11 years ago, I was pretty skeptical and thought that it wouldn't last. I was wrong. I was very wrong back then. Making 22 movies in 11 years and sharing one universe is one thing, but the ending to that era is another. Growing up with MCU changes me on how I see the sharing universe works on real life. The way they ended a saga is pretty darn good. Everything about this movie is pure excitement and you will be wanting more even after 22 movies. That three hours felt like hour and half for me. This movie made me realised that the movie industry are keep getting better through the years. Perfect ending for The Infinity Saga!",
        "This film is more than 3 hours long. The length is totally unjustified and merely makes the bland dialogue and CGI dependent fight scenes even more tortuous than they would have been had this been half the length. No element of real danger, little intelligent wit. Avengers: Endgame is the epitome of the malaise in the movies that studios and the public choose to make and watch. You will not get these three hours back again.",
        "Una pel\u00edcula hermosa digna de ser de culto, una joya en todo sentido sin ning\u00fan error y con sublimes actuaciones.",
        "A perfect blend of all Marvel super Heroes in One movie ....Thats the Avengers End Game",
        "O My God! What a villian. I have ever seen this type of strongest villian who had fought with all avengers. His performance is also good. And i love the climax scene where all avengers comes with doctor strange and assemble with thor, captain america and ironman . And the fighting scene is awesome.....",
        "Just like my headline says. Watch this masterpiece for the love of God! This and infinity war are on totally different levels to any other super hero film. And this goes one level better than infinity war, absolutely fantastic.",
        "Although I knew what would happen at the end of the film ... I could not hold back my tears ... Thank you Marvel for this masterpiece.",
        "We have laughed, cried and rejoiced during the whole journey of 22 movies and have lived through them. It have now become a part of us and I just hope that our future generations can understand and feel the things which we understood at times and felt !!!\n\nHere's to Us who witness the end of an ERA !!!",
        "Terrible ending, I can say terrible, it was scaled down to a funny story rather than a great one, worst avengers movie ever",
        "They couldn't give every hero equal billing (they tried with Antman & Captain Marvel which is the minus one star) so they made the movie all about the original Avengers from 2012 and...the movie does not disappoint. Couple of 'wow' moments with a generous sprinkling of sweet tender moments throughout. The best finale anyone can ask for and a fitting curtain call for the original Avengers. Kudos and a big THANK YOU to the Russo brothers!",
        "The best superhero franchise that makes you cry. One of the best movie.\n\nMARVEL VERIYAN.",
        "Infinity War was better. I expected from Endgame less humor and more thrilling scenes but that's ok.",
        "Watch the other 22 movies first, or else the movie doesn't make sense. They did a great job at merging all the storylines together",
        "Words aren't enough to describe the culmination of the Infinity Saga. It was just beautiful, from the amazing action set pieces to the well knit plot that tied up all the main character's story archs in a fulfilling way, all I can say is Marvel and the Russo Brothers really outdid themselves this time round. 11/10 for me.",
        "This is a good movie. But it could have been better. It has great acting. It also has a good story line. It is not a great story line mind you. The Avengers age of Ultron is mush better.",
        "Will apologize to all the fans, I am also a big comic adaptation fan, bit this one is really below my expectations. Too long, too slow, too much big actors... everything was too much. People started laughing in the cinema during some of the final scenes.\n\nA must see but overall very weak",
        "Like an avengers fan. I really love this movie. I have seen this movie for like more than 30 times. I really like the movie.",
        "MCU is unpredictable this movie is a great movie and also a action and aadventurebis just amazing i didnt guess it would be like this and i dont know what to say tums up nice.....................",
        "After Infinity War I knew it would be hard to top. And I was certainly correct. This movie has little to no action, and relies heavily on a 'blast from the past' mentality. In a movie where half the population has been wiped out, everyone seems to be pretty happy about and make jokes about it all the time.",
        "Indefinite amount of plots holes that are never explained, and lots of fans have expressed annoyance about this",
        "Just got back from Endgame here in N.Z and it will make you laugh , cry , clap and be emotionally spent but it's well worth it ! cancel everything this weekend and go and see it . Endgame is the event movie of a life time ! it is superior to Infinity War for sure and Endgame fly's by the 3 hours feel more like 2 it's just that good and I can't wait to see it again plus please go in spoiler free it is so worth it there are so many surprises that were deliberately left out of any trailers .",
        "Superb movie. I like all avengers movie Avengers: Endgame(2019) movie also a superb movie which has super heros.",
        "Practically nothing happens in the first 90 minutes, then it eventually speeds up. Usual overly long battle scenes, sone sad moments and enough laughs to keep you interested. Can see more spin offs coming at some stage to keep the money rolling in.",
        "A fun ride! End game is full of spectacular performances and action. The film has plenty of surprises so stay away from spoilers before seeing it.",
        "Another MCU all time blockbuster!!!\n\nJust want to say if you miss this one, you will surely miss your way to HEAVEN. This is the ultimate heaven! Go and watch incredible journey of Robert Downey Jr & his team's performance.",
        "The movie is great. They try to present itself as the ultimatum epic movie and i believe it succeeded. There is an epic moment on every corner.\n\nThe overall plot is a lot of mess, too much fan service and the action is good but could have been much better. A lot of mess in the battle scenes too.\n\nThe movie is pure entertaining and fun. Don't bother too much about quality and technical stuff.",
        "Forget people who say that this movie is crap,because the way I see it avengers endgame is the most entertaining movie in history so far.",
        "To be fair there has been a lot of build up story and character development movies to this, but what a payoff. Will there ever be such reward for the audience that has followed the journey? I find it hard to believe. If there ever is I hope to experience it in my lifetime.\n\nWith Infinity War to complement this main story-line, the audience is given an absolute treat. I am grateful to have followed this journey since 2008 and avoided all spoilers. Put simply, in my opinion, if you have seen all the preceding MCU movies, Infinity War and Endgame are the best action/superhero movies ever.",
        "This is a very weak film that has both good sides and bad sides, a good side is only in the picture and in the humor, everything else is bad, the plot is weak and we repeat ourselves, there are many plot holes, the laws of the universe are violated, sometimes the graphics look very cheap, if the war of infinity is a masterpiece then the endgame is a fan service !!! So bad final(((",
        "Super hyped and still entertained but felt underwhelmed and disappointed. Yet, the writings were on the wall with Cpt Marvel. Nonetheless go watch as this will be the last MCU with still a bit of quality. It is obvious which direction future Marvel films will take and it will not be good. Rest In Peace MCU.",
        "I think it would disrespect the movie if you write something about this movie...",
        "The movie left me shocked, and astonished. Great movie, Best Marvel movie by a long shot. Wow, just Wow.",
        "If you write a bad review about this movie you haven't seen all the other marvel movies you may have just seen infinity war and endgame you have no understanding of the super hero's how there Character have developed through the own films how the films interlinked , how true fans can watch mcu films again and again and love every second How just the theme music to the Avender moves send shivers down your spin true fans no this , not random people who pass judgment after only seeing 2 films you need to see THE HOLE PICTURE not just one corner",
        "Saw this in theatre. Best theater movie I have seen together with the \" Gladiator\" and \" Avatar\". Thanos lines give me the chill. Great characters and movie! 10 out of ten!",
        "What a film from start to finish. As per usual Marvel have gone and done it again.. Best film by a mile",
        "I can't say more than that I have enjoyed every single second! People and even some critics can't stop complaining about the length of this movie, which doesn't line up to the fact that this is the end (together with far from home) of an era containing 22 movies! What else is there to say? Well, I didn't have such a great time in cinema for a year, the last one was Infinity War;) To come to an end: Every emotion was affected by this movie, literally EVERY emotion! From joy to anger, over to fear, ending in sadness...This is one of the best movies in the past 7 years! So if you haven't seen it yet: Go ahead!!!",
        "I had such big expectations for this movie and i was so anxious to see it that in the past two weeks i kept dreaming and thinking about it every day. But, unfortunetly, the movie dissapointed me pretty much. I really like the Ruso brothers and they have had great imagination and are good at what they do, but this movie was casted and filmed in a hurry with little to almost no action at all and lack of inspiration and imagination. They could have done a much better job with the Endgame movie but i guess that is what happens when you rush to make even more money and don't care much about the fans. Hope they make it up to us with their next movie.",
        "Pretty good but I wished for more. More movies with just one super hero",
        "After waiting so long for this film it was rather boring and disappointing. Could of had so much more as a closing film",
        "Avengers: endgame is not you're typical action sci fi movie , it is a culmination to 11 years worth of storytelling from the first Iron man movie, the depth in the performances by the actors reflects there character development in the past years with everyone getting the time to shine . The direction, the story and the VFX is something one can only fantasize about and the third act is way past ones imagination where all the characters under Marvel's humongous banner come into play and create epic moments. All in all Avengers endgame is an experience nobody should miss as it's a captivating end to what we have seen before",
        "After Infinity war I had very high expectations, and boy I was wrong.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the movie is 'watchable' but far on quality and energy from the previous one.\n\nP.S - if you are hulk fan (like me!) get ready to be disappointed even more. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie.",
        "A poor finish to the avengers saga. Too many characters with not enough to do. The final battle was underwhelming. Some of the main characters (Thor,hulk) reduced to buffoonery. Some good points like cap and Starks final ending. Thanos is probably one of the best baddies ever. The guardian's and antman were poor. Far too long a film and was padded in places although I can forgive it because we probably wo t be seeing the actors continuing in their roles. Not as disappointing as game of thrones though. Younger viewers will love it.",
        "I'm not going to spoil anything. All I have of say is I laughed, I cried, and I got chills down my spine throughout the whole movie. The theater was packed to the rim, and everyone in my row got up in tears. This movie might have been the best I have ever seen, and I will definitely watch it again and again once it come out on the tv. Definitely as good as infinity war, and in my opinion better. If you love the avengers, you will love this movie.",
        "Had some really good twists, overall awesome 3 hours!",
        "Script-wise it is not a bad movie. But I really don't like the bad jokes. The action scenes are way too much for me...",
        "This isn't so much a movie as an experience. And the homework needed to fully appreciate this is daunting for the most dedicated fans. But the pay-off for sticking with the MCU for 11 years and 22 movies is nothing short of spectacular. So many shocking developments, awesome moments and tear jerking scenes that even the most critical, cynical moviegoers will just be beaten into thoroughly enjoying this movie. There will never be another cinematic moment like this.",
        "Can't Say nothing it's the greatest Superhero movie of all time",
        "Absolutely loved everything about this movie. It gave me everything I hoped for, and much more. After 11 years and 22 movies, this is the finale where everything comes together. Three hours is a long sit, but I would gladly sacrifice my ass to watch a bit longer. God bless you Stan Lee. Eat that DC.",
        "If you want, you can certainly find several weaknesses in this film. But why spoil the fun? As someone who, as a child, flicked through the superhero comics with big eyes, this film is a childhood that has come to life. Sure, it's a bit overloaded, but it always remains surprising, it's an emotional conclusion and, above all, a film for the fans, which became clear when half the hall jumps out of its seats and shouts \"Assemble\". And for that I say thank you!",
        "I am trying to be honest and being objective as much as I can : this movie is EPIC, I am sure ever single person in the world who has watched it will be pleased and satisfied. It was a complete emotion-packed movie.\n\nIt has a few flaws, I am sure some Marvel fans feel it too, some may be annoyed by the flaws (the directors should have done this, done that, why not this, why not that, minor plot holes, etc) but all was paid off by its EPIC-ness.\n\nPS : I felt empty after I watched the Endgame, even until I write this review. It is not because I don't like the movie, it is just because I am not sure whether the next MCU saga will be as GREAT and EPIC as this. Good luck for the future MCU !!",
        "After 21 movies in the MCU, Endgame manages to not only bring a satisfying ending for this saga, but it also manages to bring up a coherent story full of intense and emotional moments, and a wonderful third act final battle that blows my mind. Despite having an ambitious plot overall, the Russo Brothers created an espectacular movie where everyone in the general audience can enjoy.",
        "This film is the conclusion of the infinity saga series containing all 22 films for the past 10 years. Plotwise is great. It's a great storytelling. Few scenes are weird but acceptable. Marry Sue? Very few. OP? Just very few. It's reasonable and fun to watch every minutes. Nebula's arc is good and the actress is great. Every 6 main character's arcs including Ant-man are decent. There are shocks and twists but reasonable also. Characters from the past return and add very good additional contexts. The screenwriters, directors and producers made a good job. The CGI is good and realistic. The acting is world class. Many characters but they lifts up each other in the good way. Every actors are great. I can see myself go back to watch it ten times, and I can do this all day. Enjoy :) I actually rate this movie 9.6/10, but lean towards 10.",
        "Poor character development\na lot of unnecessary characters that barely have a line\nweird pacing\nlast act was pretty much a reenact of IW where they actually win",
        "Its kind of sad it end here. Its so graceful that the end game doing an amazing work as usual Avengers does . And It does even the best among all. Just a super experieances to be in the cinema watching this . The audios are actually cheers and clap all the times while the movie is playing . Its a wonderful moment of all time !! What a Great work for the Hero movies like this , like all !",
        "This is the best movie from MCU so far, if you don't like marvel I'm honestly sorry for you because these movies are absolutely breathtaking. If you are considering watching this movie you probably should watch all the other ones first but at least watch Infinity War. In my opinion the action and the story line in this movie is the best so far. I recommend you all to watch this movie especially those who love MCU/Avenger.",
        "Life, military life follows orders, and this is (military) life seeing other (military) life - or seeing itself.\n\nAKA\n\nPhilosophy creates the philosophy of science for science, which is philosophy being itself to science.",
        "This is the best movie I have ever seen! This movie is such a love letter to the fans of Marvel. I have never had so much emotion drawn from me in a movie. The story is so amazing and a beautiful way to end the Marvel Infinity Saga.",
        "Just a ridiculous movie with an ordinary plot.\n\nWatched it for an hour then got out of cinema\n\nNo doubt people have been brainwashed by the Avengers franchise.\n\nIts just so silly really.\n\nSpecial effects were OK.\n\nDon't waste your time, 3 hours",
        "Pacing issues but good emotional payoff. Could cut some scenes. Ambitious film with many different storylines that would normally bog down a film but works well here. Characters are well written and realized. Excellent action sequences but some unfocused shots. Tonal shifts done well.",
        "A worthy ending of ten year film history that was made! A absolutely stunning, great, funny and emotional film.",
        "A marvellously epic & enormously satisfying extravaganza that concludes a decade's worth of narrative on a thumping & triumphant note, Avengers: Endgame is a crescendo, a celebration, a closure & a culmination of a 22-film saga that returns our 11 years of investment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a massive pay-off. A memorable finale of an unprecedented cinematic universe that won't soon, if ever, find an equal, Endgame is Marvel Studios' magnum opus.",
        "This is a good movie but its not a typical marvel movie. i mean aren't you a fan of marvel because of all those crazy action sequences? but this movie have it less. this is more like a ending to the previous movies so dont except it to be as equal as infinity war interms of action but this movie have a lot of emotional scenes which you can get attached if you are marvel fan but if you are not then the first 2hours wont make much sense to you. as a marvel fan i can rate this movie 10/10 i even watched it two times but as a general audience this movie goes to either 7 or 8.",
        "I don't care what anyone says, this is the best film I have ever seen period. Maybe the plot wasn't the best and some things could've been improved upon but the overall film was amazing. I have never had an experience as good as the first time I watched endgame and I doubt I ever will again. It will makes you laugh, and cry guaranteed.",
        "This was the best marvel film I have ever seen and the action was off the charts I just don't like what they did to carol's hair at all.",
        "This movie is the culmination of 21 movies for over 10 years in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",
        "Avengers Endgame is truly one of the best epic films ever made.. This film literally made entire theatre whistle, laugh, cry, sad and shout their lungs out!!! There are few moments which will make every marvel cry, no matter how hard they hold onto....",
        "Was the Director and writers high! The more popular a movie becomes, and the more money thrown at the directors for a bigger and better sequel, the more pathetic the story line gets, Here's a clue hire at least one good writer!",
        "Marvel movie series has been everyone's favorite since the very beginning, Avengers Endgame, is such a movie which is filled with immense emotions and above all it is a visual treat, Top class VFX is used in this movie, Viewers will Enjoy the movie till the end, However for a true marvel fan this movie will end up bringing tears in eyes, Because Avengers Endgame Is the End of the Marvel Era for now, in short This movie is an Emotional and Action Blockbuster.",
        "It's well directed. It's well edited. Great use of chi and it also gives a emotional punch along the way of this roller coaster ride of a movie",
        "So Avengers Endgame was the most epic Marvel movie I've ever seen it's a celebration of all the movies in the MCU leading up to Avengers Endgame and it was a walk down memory lane the entire movie and it's filled with references only people who have been around since the beginning will understand and get and yes it's 3 hours but every second of this movie is worth your time I've seen it now 3 times and still wanna see it AGAIN! I don't want to spoil anything but basically it's awesome!",
        "I appreciated the movie greatly. They handled time travel in a very deft fashion, and tied it up nicely. I appreciate that they managed to maintain stakes for future installments.\n\nI have been a marvel fan since MY beginning. I read the comics as a kid, and made my own costumes. I latched onto the MCU from film 1 and have been there for every up and down of the franchise. I am proud of how they brought this era to a close.",
        "Avengers Endgame is one of the most excellent film that has ever been made this 21st century. With all of the 22 films culminated in one huge and complex story, the film satisfies the international community with an emotional and still an action-packed film that everyone will never forget, marking the end of an old era and giving way for more new characters and stories along the way for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe",
        "Just for back with my wife and some Friends from the movie theater, and frankly i thought that this movie was pretty descent, however way too overrated.\n\nIt had a good concept, cool CGI, emocional ending and some funny parts.\n\nBut it also had a huge lack of charactet development, way too much time wasted on dialogs wich could've been used for more action and other characters that bearly appeared until the very ending, not too impresive fight coreographies, way too much expectations for too little impact.\n\nLike i said, it's pretty good, but overrated, i personally liked Infinity War much better.",
        "This is a good movie. But it could have been better. It has great acting. It also has a good story line. It is not a great story line mind you. The Avengers age of Ultron is mush better.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is the highest-grossing move of all time. It has one of the best superhero scenes of all time. If you love Marvel, you will get chills! The Avengers get to a new level. This might be the greatest Marvel movie of all time, and it is worth the 3 hours. As it is a superhero film, not very much blood is shown. There are only streams of blood down the side of people's faces, a splatter of blood that is NOT visible on someone's face. Suitable for ages 8+.",
        "This is how you to end a series an epic ending perfect I cried so much",
        "Marvel knows hoe to get the viewers involved into a movie and then how to play eith their emotions!",
        "The best action,comedy and emotional ride ever Made best movie of all time great direction and excellent acting ,must watch",
        "Not overly great, but that's when comparing it to Infinity War. The humour was good, if a little unnecessary at times. I'm afraid I found myself looking at my watch just a little too much. That said, a solid 7.",
        "I didn't like the acting. Thanos doesn't seem like the badass of the first movie",
        "I won't put in spoilers just that I love Marvel and I was blown away by how amazing this movie was. Reached all my expectations and more. It deserves all the praise it's getting.",
        "Hyper ratings are not realistic it wont go over 8.5 for me",
        "Honestly, this is probably the best superhero film I've ever seen in my life. Not only does this film deliver on spectacle, but it's very character driven as well, especially in the first act. Not many superhero films can deal with grief and lost in such a great way, and then can make you laugh in the next scene without feeling jarring. I don't see how Marvel Studios can top this film.",
        "Ugh. This three hour opus did not need to be three hours.\n\nSure, it had moments. I love you 3000 being a stellar one. America's ass being another.\n\nBut mostly ick. Still I watched it as I have been a fan of the rest. Glad I waited for it to come out on dvd.",
        "This was a entertaining film that did its job and nothing more than that and really there's not that much to say about it. I am a fan of the comics and used to be a big fan of the movies until they just became kind of forgettable. Also there are a lot of plot holes in it but if you wanna here about those I recommend a film review channel called yms that describes it. Anyway go see it if your a fan.",
        "The highly anticipated culmination of the Infinity Saga comes to a head in this gripping and episodic installment. Following the grave decimation left by the will of Thanos, the last of the Avengers are left to lament over their losses and failure to protect the universe. With their remaining allies, and a few new ones as well, they devise an elaborate, last-ditch scheme vowing to do whatever it takes to restore the world as they once knew it. Well-crafted, often intensely emotional story is much different in style and in tone than its immediate predecessor, and though the pace lags at times when it gets caught up in the necessary plot jabber (which may raise more questions than answers) it unfolds in ways you wouldn't quite expect with slick, clever twists and in-jokes, wonderful lines, moments of true nostalgia and heroism that pay tribute to the many characters that dedicated followers have come to love over the years. Doesn't quite capture that frantic, ongoing sense of urgency that Infinity War did, but it's rewarding nonetheless, with a smashing and unforgettable finale for series fans. ***",
        "Words can't even describe how good this movie is I love it I could watch it thousands time and probably will",
        "There is not enough words to describe this piece of art, literally the best thing I've ever seen, it has it all, all the emotions all any one could ever want in a movie is there. You're missing a lifetime experience if you haven't seen it yet.",
        "Never has a sequel or franchise been so complete. Perfect writing, perfect effects, perfect stunts. So many call backs with payoffs. There were grown men and women weeping. And all your wishes and expectations have come through.",
        "Wile it does have time plot holes, it is still a AMAZING MOVIE. It is amazingly sad. It deserves to be the highest grossing movie ever. And absolute need to see!!!",
        "We have witness something that we will never ever forget from marvels....",
        "They should include the X-Men in their next movie.",
        "A fairly entertaining hero movie that, even with its long running time, doesn't really feel tiring. It begins interestingly and in pure Avengers style it becomes more and more chaotic as time progresses. This is a consequence of the too many storylines that need to be merged and the too many characters that are to be followed. Tonal shifts are omnipresent and a few characters are thrown out of context for the sake of unnecessary comic relief. With the story progressing, typical cliches of ending stories become apparent and unexplained convenient turn of events start to happen. This is nothing new and, as in the previous movies, sometimes it's just impossible to make sense of how and why a situation occurs. You have to accept it for the sake of the storyline be it someone suddenly becoming overpowered, acquiring a new power or conveniently stumbling upon a revelation. In the end, an unimpressive and quite predictable storyline spiced with great effects, a good soundtrack and a few interesting characters.",
        "Went in with very high expectation because of IW (I watched IW 3 times) and the inclusion of Capt Marvel (didn't like the movie thou). It got some good moments (milking the sadness of defeat) and some clever and inspirational lines (which I think is very important for superhero movies that mcu a bit lacking). Sometimes the jokes came in the way of the emotional moments thou. Felt a bit uneven overall. Hope for so much more from Capt Marvel but ... And bit sad looking at Hulk and Thor become victim of plot. It's quite a mixed feeling movie for me. Just an ok I guess?",
        "I don't even know how many times I said \"you are KIDDING ME!\" out loud, in the theater! It was a LOT of movie for the price of the tickets. So much closure, so many laughs, and also some tears. I don't think any movie will ever be as worth seeing ever again. Thank you, Marvel, for an incredible story. Just perfect.",
        "The movie most disappointed. Boring but exciting in other moments. I've expecting receive an epic and amazing ending after 22 movies. But. I just received and screenplay with black hole that eat the logic and congruence. I'm disappointed. Furious.\n\nI want to see a marvelous movie. But, why? Why marvel? You made a movie full of no logic just completely made for fan service. Is just a mixture of back to the future, and other moves referenced in.\n\nWas good. Not epic. Was bad. Not terrible.\n\nUnfunny. The jokes don't made me laugh. But see all superheroes in screen was emotional and right. Some minutes were boring and useless. Some characters were wasted.",
        "Some beautiful character moments that cut through right to the character's core and a fantastic ode to the past ten years. Just would have liked some nuanced action.",
        "It was a good movie it just didn't need to take 3 hour",
        "Best movie i just love it. It the best movie of the decade i guess everyone reading this must watch this movie.",
        "This movie was set up brilliantly by infinity war. The suspense the ending and the direction was all up to the mark. The cast delivers perfectly. Some of the theories used in the movie create plot holes which are well taken care of. Some of the parts of the movie is not well explained. It is a lot to grasp at the first watch. I thought that Robert Downey Jr performed brilliantly. The movie clocks well over 3 hours, but in the end keeps you wanting more. It opens up a wide future for the MCU to take shape into. It lives up to the hype. I felt that some of the cast members deserved more screen time. Otherwise you can put it up well with the best superhero movies of all time. If not the best.",
        "The final part of the culmination of all the MCU movies couldn't have been executed better.. Before the smartest guys in the milky way start talking about the loopholes in the time travel theory let me tell you that this is a comic book movie and not a time travel documentary so please take it with a pinch of salt.. Having said that, the movie gets a lot of science right and the best part is the storyline, related Easter eggs and references to the previous movies and the sheer comic book on a larger than life magnitude that makes this movie the best comic book movie ever made... This is pure gold...",
        "Ok so it's 3 hours long, believe me the time flies. This film is engaging, thrilling, emotional and breathtaking. Not over the top but serious fun.",
        "Man i was sooo exicted over this movie, but it wasn't what i expected at all. I wish i would've liked this more than i did, i want to love this movie so bad but i just can't. Im givin it an 8 just because i love MCU and i liked the battle in the 3rd act.",
        "So i got the chance to see this movie earlier today in Warsaw,Poland. Now I know my title might be arguable to most people but for me and alot of the fans who have been invested in this for the last 10 years, this is no understating the fact that it is the best comicbook/superhero event ever! And possibly for a long long time we won't be seeing anything close to this.\n\nI won't say anything about the movie because i dont want to spoil the Endgame for you!\n\nThis movie is everything and beyond what we could have expected it to be! it does more than that and it has that satisfying end we all wanted!\n\nI write this review today as a proud and emotional fan who is satisfied to see these 10-11 years being paid off!",
        "10/10\u2764 Best film i've ever seen. I need to go and watch this 1 more time\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0dJUST PERFECT\u2764 Thank you Marvel\u2764",
        "What do I say this movie in incredible I started watching marvel movies around when the first avengers movie came out ever sense I seen everyone of them",
        "This was absolutely the best possible way the universe could of ended. Acting was amazing, directing flawless. 10/10",
        "I should say , Avengers Endgame could have been far better and way more incredible if around 20-30 minutes were trimmed off from the runtime that includes the first half scenes . 181 minutes is too much time and it is disappointing to see that half of this film is not worth it . A binding of 22 films and ending is satisfying and the best ever but , for the movie as a whole 8.5 IMDB (as per now) is over rated and the credit goes to MCU fans who got swayed with just last 40 minutes of the film for which I think they came . This movie was not better tham Avengers Infinity War .",
        "This is the first and foremost english movie which i've/we've watched the opening show in the morning at 5am. As it marks the end of the decade long marvel collection of movies, we were very much thrilled to watch the movie asap, but still we got tickets only on the next day. It was definitely one of the fascinating experience as the movie was filled with so many things like time travel, actions, emotions, suspense, it is definitely the most anticipated movie as everybody knows but the fact that it still manages to entertain is where the movie makers excel, hats off to pull off such a massive thing. But making my favourite Iron Man disappear in the end was unexpected and long lasting. In tamil Vijay Sethupathis' voice was just set into our sub conscious very well so it didn't set too much to the movie from the point of view of general audience like us.",
        "So, when i just looked in here for viewing the ratings, all i ever saw was 1 rating. I don't know what's the matter with the haters and i never will. And honestly, i don't care. I just wanted to say it.\n\nNow about the movie, it was a masterpiece in many ways. First of all, the performances, the ensemble cast. It was a beauty. Then Silvestri's music. The story, the pacing, the humour. Then the emotional depth, RDJ's acting.\n\nEverything was right about movie. The cliffhanger of Mjolnir wielding was exceptional. I loved it. I always will.",
        "This film is good because it makes the audience angry, shocked, and cry at the same time.",
        "Yea its good film and many fans of the avenger likes the ending of the endgame. Actually i like plot twist in this film and its shocking . The film is inspiring to everyone. I always rewatch the film because its a great film.",
        "What a masterpiece. I'm still in tears, even after 7 hours.. It was better than anything I've imagined.",
        "That was the best movie Marvel i ever seen, everything are brilliant the all actors unbelievable for acting that movie, it deserves any trophy in these years.",
        "Dabby Dobbo have a taco.\n\nGo for hulk, Steve who? *Playstation Shrek face*",
        "It worth Watching It makes you \ud83d\ude22 Iron-man to endgame",
        "Overall, I think it's not as good as Infinity War. Pretty disappointed with what they did with Thor and the Hulk. Pretty average movie, and much as I hate to say.",
        "So sad about some character's passing but this was an amazing watch and a great end!",
        "Yeah it's awesome. 23 movies and a decade worth of film making culminated in this. The like of which we may never see again.",
        "It was not a great movie, the previous movie was much better and I mean a lot. It could and should have been better but they tried to play it safe. I did enjoy the movie but when people talk about standing ovation I just roll my eyes. This is what worries me to much of this from fan boys that can see know wrong most watch without seeing.\n\nEven though I did like this move some parts just bug me like the messy theories of time travel. Infact they made a mess of time travel theory and please dont tell me oh yeah its the Grandfather Paradox. The fact is so much was dependent on the past that if Thanos didnt do all those things as well as some of the others then much of the present would not be the same regardless of how you put it. The Guardians of the Galaxy would never had met Gamora so they would not know her etc",
        "No matter what you think you can expect about Marvel Studios' Avengers: Endgame movie, the movie will be far from your expectations!\n\nJust try to remember the main characters in the last 20 movies before watching it.",
        "It would an understatement to call this motion picture \"an adequate film\". It is quite the amazing film. The plot really is a home run, and the ending battle with the titan Thanos is amazing. The ending was sad(no spoilers). Definitely reserve time, your favorite snack foods, and days to watch this incredible film.",
        "Man this gotta be the best one, it wasn't how i thought it was gonna be but it was still dope.......",
        "Just came out of the cinema and the first word coming to my mind is 'EPIC'. This movie concluded the past 11 years in the best possible way or even better because a movie like this seemed to be impossible. The great battle scene is the very best in cinematic history, to be honest it is almost as good as an orgasm. I am happy that I could witness it - what is more on the premiere day. This masterpiece made me prouder than ever to be an MCU fan! Well done! Pretty sure I will pay to see it again... and again... :)",
        "Perfect conclusion to the 22 film saga satisfyingly wraps up several characters' multi-film arcs, while opening up possibilities for several others; that said, it's not without its faults, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly.",
        "I gave this movie a 1/10... watch IMDB change it to a 10 Pay to play. Welcome to the real world.",
        "Well must say,i didnt watch the movie when it hit the theaters and althought i am a big fan of the franchise. I didnt expect a lot, thought i must be a slower pace to tell the story of the world that was created, yet.... it was damn to slow and borin. Without the death of Nat and Iron Man it would be like a Hallmark production. And even the final battle scene was like a copy paste from the last Averngers. Than Captain Marvel was like 5 sec to see, the funny part was only Thor and Hulk?! What the hell was that? I never liked Mark Ruffalo as Hulk but i let it pass, but here in the last Avengers... am actually glad i didnt get to see it in the cinema, would habe been waste of my money",
        "Just watched this in cinema today and i'm not disappointed. First few minutes were slow, but it gets very intriguing after that. Most of the action scenes come towards the end of the movie and they were very good, but I wish it had more or lasted longer. I felt the story was good and made sense, but there's probably some cliches or plot holes that I don't know about lol. It's a good movie, not the greatest movie ever like some people say, that's The Shawshank Redemption for me, but it's still one of the best action movies and worth a watch.",
        "Endgame isn't just any regular super hero movie where ultimately the good guys defeat the bad guy. It's something entirely different. There's a Villain who's motive is really convincing andheroes who were defeated and are vulnerable. Ultimately it's not the triumph of good against the bad, it's the triumph of the greater good for all mankind. This is what that makes the movie unique. Russo brother's has done an outstanding job in bringing such a movie which is in a class on its own. Every single actors were excellent, but ultimately Chris Evans and Robert Downey Junior outshone every single person. Forget the negative criticism from peoples. This movie is a once in a generation event and must be seen from the theatre. Definitely it'll give you goosebumps.",
        "Its an end of a era,If you have been watching these Movies since Iron man you have to watch this",
        "I love marvel movies. They aren't always the greatest movies, they are usually really good, but they are always fun. To tie all the stories together, develop these characters, create emotional connection, and still be fun and entertaining is no small task. Lost couldn't even end a couple of seasons on an island. This crosses time, reality, and space and yet still is a wonderfully satisfying conclusion to 22 films. Wonderful. Simply wonderful. Though why am I writing this? Is there really someone deciding whether or not to watch the epic conclusion to these movies based on an IMDb review?",
        "Overall A Plus movie ending 4 out of 5 root 5 out of 5 intensity 5 out of 5 connectivity 5 out of 5 scores and soundtracks 5 out of 5 screenplay five out of five cinematography 5 out of 5 character development 5 out of 5 story 5 out of 5",
        "Infinity War is just too big of a movie to overcome & Endgame suffers from trying to do it. The pacing was bad. Some characters are misrepresented & their arcs are ruined by doing so. Somehow this movie can't handle the amount of characters in it, but it's predecessor do it really great. Disappointing.",
        "\"Avengers: Endgame\" is a satisfying, expertly made sequel in the franchise and combines with \"Infinity War\" to create the MCU's best, most compelling storytelling. I think that this movie raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it as it stands out as one of the most detailed, satisfying conclusions to a chapter in a long-running franchise. All the necessary heroes get the right amount of screen time and there is a great blend of grief and humor. \"Avengers: Endgame\" is a beautifully-constructed piece of popcorn cinema and anyone who has given their time to this world will find it to be a rewarding and effective payoff. The word epic is the right one for this movie. The end. nikisreviews.gr",
        "A masterful epic - a true culmination of 22 films that not only concludes the story, but expands upon it. You'll learn more about the other movies while this one unfolds. If Infinity War is the brawn, Endgame is the brains. And wow, what an ending!",
        "F..., i was just like a child again. Crying like a baby. This movie derserves the title Endgame!!! Simply outstanding! Overwhelming!",
        "Avengers: Endgame tries to do it all, but falls flat if you're not a die hard MCU Fan who obsesses about all the characters and details. While Infinite War upped the ante and delivered, Endgame in comparison has too much not very intriguing character mediations instead of development. And it isn't much help that the final scene plays out similiar to Infinity War. While it is an enjoyable movie and a fitting end to the Saga of the Infinity Stones, it's much more exciting to think about what might lie ahead in the MCU.",
        "Film which triggered a lot of emotion. Fantastic end to the franchise.",
        "You don't need any review to watch this one buddy. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
        "A film to make it unpredictable should not be sacrificed like this. should not be watched with great expectation. I am very sad.",
        "I'm prepared to instantly label Avengers: Endgame as the best of the 23 Marvel Universe movies especially the part when the all come back it gave me goosebumps like crazy.\n\nGOOD JOB GUYS.",
        "From the beginning to end the movie is perfect!!!!",
        "No amount of words can explain this rollercoaster of emotions \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31",
        "Avengers Endgame is the culmination of 11 years of movies, in this vast universe of comics, as a fan since the first iron man movie, which hooked, I thought that the Winter Soldier was the best Marvel movie, but Infinity War and Endgame made me To think twice, this movie is something truly epic, I had not seen something like this since the Lord of the Rings: the return of the king, and even that has plot holes, and that he makes the same mistakes as his predecessor Infinity war brothers Russo did an incredible job together with the whole cast, it's one of those movies to watch before he dies, this movie does put an \"End\" on this Infinity Saga.",
        "I wasn't expecting much after Avengers: Infinity War. So the galaxy is reduced by 50%...so what. What's so big about that. We'll just mourn our losses and have a bunch of babies. This movie was a little pathetic. There were some really cool parts...definitely worth watching. However, there's just too much PC, WOKE Hollywood pandering getting in the way of the story. Overall, it was kind of a dumb premise so they could kill off some characters with some \"oh wow\" scenes. Not very good.",
        "Avengers infinity War was one of those heart stopping movies. It had everything going on and it just worked out perfect. Going into End Game I had high expectations and was sadly disappointed. The movie was very underwhelming. May I even say boring at times.",
        "Just came from a midnight screening , what a movie ! It will leave with every emotion ! Thank you MCU for this franchise !",
        "Unfortunately its wasn't that much good\n\nThe characters not taken the same space as infinity war where we seen all of them with there true power",
        "The cgi effects are horrible, has parts where it looks like Shrek.. the move is way too long, to many useless scenes, just boring. I barely made it in 3 attempts",
        "I like superhero flicks. Being honest though, there is a certain 'sameness' to most of them. Avengers: Endgame could be called the granddaddy of all superhero movies, I suppose. At just a touch over 3 hours long, it is certainly far longer than most. It probably features more superheroes than most too. At one point, I think every Marvel superhero that ever existed was on screen - (except, curiously, the X-Men). Yes, a lot of time, effort, creativity and money - lots of money - went into this. Sadly, it left me feeling kind of flat. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but I didn't love it. In fact, I didn't feel anything when it was over - no sadness at the losses incurred, no exhilaration at the victories. Nothing. I never found myself on the edge of my seat once. This may have been Marvel's great battle-of-our-time movie, but it was no Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (now THAT was a movie that pulled you in!). So, I guess we're left asking where to now Marvel? Do we care? I know I'll keep watching what you put out, but the lustre is starting to wear thin.",
        "I got disappointed about Thor and Hulk. And the Directors of Marvel for making the Thor and Hulk too weak. The reason i went first day first show because to see Thor. Russo brothers is suck.",
        "This is without doubt my favourite Avengers movie. I've enjoyed every moment of this highly anticipated final installment. It was the end of an era and we got goosebump moments and a heartbreaking death-scene. There's nothing more to say than you've got to watch it! I love you 3000!",
        "I just came out of the cinema and I'm still all processing what I've just seen. And I'm going back in tomorrow to soak it up again. Come back here and finish the review. I simply can't right now. What an impact it has.\n\nJust go watch, this is the worthy conclusion of the MCU.",
        "And they made the one that really, really worked. There were old people, 70+ years old, and young,6, 7, or 8 years old. Total fans and people who had only seen a few of the preceding 22 movies They all applauded. There were times the theatre was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. There were times when everyone held their breath. There were times you could not be so stone coldhearted that you would not tear up. There were times when you could not help but smile. There were times when you had to laugh. There were times when you recalled a special moment from an earlier movie in a brand new way. There were things that are brand-new By the end of the movie you saw the whole series in a different light. I wish I could see it again without ever having seen it beforehand. There were so many small touches that made the movie special and capped the series perfectly. And yet, the movie worked for people who had never read the comics or seen most of the movies. Like I said, they made the one that really, really worked. Thank you, Avengers! #Cap #Tony #Thor #Nat #Clint #Hulk",
        "It really what we can call, the best end to the avengers. The visual effects are wonderful with lots of laughter and emotional scenes. The 3d 4dx worth it.",
        "Just how much time we need to see a movie like this again",
        "Well, there's no two ways about a Marvel movie: all out CGI, rib tickling humour, emotions, a very minimalistic feel of a possible romantic link up, catchy one-liners - all offered in a close to a 3hrs movie (to get the viewer interested in each one of the characters is a task no human can be 100% successful at) - as expected. All said and done, it's well worth the hype, and the wait. I still remember the good old days (at the start of Ironman franchise) thinking Ironman is meant to do something bigger. Marvel fans: that moment has arrived!!\n\nThe only thing negative about this movie is: Thanos as a villain has little to do, even in this 3hour long saga; all his powers seem pointless in front of the endless list of superheroes.",
        "There have been few Marvel movies that I vaguely liked, and over the years, I've fallen asleep through many. I straight up didn't understand some of them, and none of them did I genuinely enjoy the whole way through.\n\nExcept this one. This one is different. It is the only one that made me care about anything that was happening. Spending a lot of time on story/emotional development in the first hour made me care about what happened the last two. And it flew by, didn't even notice. I cried, laughed and actually cheered/rooted during the last fight scene.\n\nBest one of the bunch for me. Glad it could wrap up on a high note.",
        "If you haven't seen this movie in the theatres, then I am sorry to say that you have missed an experience which is beyond anything anyone can say. The movie provides an ultimate payoff to your hard-work in watching the previous 21 movies. The callbacks and references to the previous movies is just phenomenal, and the emotional quotient of the movie is higher than expected, but it is perfect. A must watch...\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",
        "Of course they have to slip in the usual modern PC bs.",
        "Fitting end to such a legendary saga. Dont see how this can ever be topped.",
        "A great end of an era. That's all I need to say. Not a crazy Marvel fan, but this one just got me right away.",
        "Good but a bit overrated movie by marvel fans. I was excited before watching the movie but after watching the movie not meeting my expections.",
        "The wrap-up to last's year Infinity War is a satisfying wellspring of closure to many of our Marvel faves as the battle against Thanos & his minions to save the universe & perhaps restore the lost lives that were disappeared when the snap heard around the universe was instituted. Not going into the outcomes of some characters or mucking about in spoilers, this effort by the Russo brothers is gargantuan in scope & intent as multiple storylines through 22 separate films comes to a head. Whether you come from your screening satisfied or frustrated, you must give heed to the Herculean effort attempted & accomplished. This is surely a film for the ages.",
        "That was one hell of a movie to end the Infinity Saga. Emotional, action-packed, creative. Avengers: Endgame was quiet the ride and was one interesting end to the Avengers and the beginning of something new. One of the best MCU movies if not the best.\n\nVery good story with great atmosphere and tone, it's a bit less funny than Infinity War but had my laughs here and there. The movie also dragged on a bit too long but the pacing is tolerable for the most part. The directing and writing were also very good. The dynamics between the characters were great such as Hawkeye and Black Widow. And lastly it had entertaining CGI mixed with music that matched the movie perfectly.\n\nOverall an enjoyable film.\n\nMemorable: So so Rewatchable: Yes.",
        "Far surpasses the hype. Going back again as soon as possible for an IMAX experience.",
        "The movie is amazing! Nothing to complain about!!\n\nThe fact that they worked on this movie for 8 year is just insane!",
        "For a series in the Marvel universe that started fairly bland, MCU's Avengers: Endgame brings out everything that makes it stand out. Characters were solid, all respected their role in the plot and not one of the dialogues between them was redundant. Plot kept its pacing, coherence and more importantly its continuation from Infinity War which is essentially Part 1 of this movie. This is one the weird movies that doesnt soely rely on its own 1hr 30 mins narrative to drive a plot, but takes privileges from the movies that came before and neatly tie everything down, its clever and well executed, i honestly wish there were more moments like this in the MCU. No spoilers so its short, this is a movie that deserve praise, 10/10 for perfect sequel.",
        "It had a few actually funny scenes a few great action scenes and incredible ending. Making this movie 3 hours did nothing but draw it out to be tedious and boring. It had the potential to be the 9.1 rating people are giving it if editing had trimmed a lot more of the fat. Way over rated.",
        "Captured some of the funniness of the first movie that made it so good and lost the balance in the Movies in between. The balance of action & comedy drama for me returned here is what's best about these films.",
        "What is wrong with people.they are rating 1 or 2. I mean this is the greatest movie of marvel. Those who are rating 1 on this movie are probably hater or they don't have better taste on movies.",
        "It was more of a celebration than a movie. Beautiful storyline, stunning visuals, power-packed and great performance from everyone involved. Movie of the decade.",
        "OMG Guys ! This was the best Directed, edited and everything in a marvel movie ever. I love how they play with our emotions one moment you are sad and the next one you are laughing. In addition, they gave every character the perfect screen time ! I Must say that everyone should see this MASTERPIECE On IMAX to see the beauty of it.",
        "Endgame really makes you look at all the movies as a whole series of events with an outcome. It makes all the movies come together in a way that makes everything better. They really did something special with Endgame, especially with the challenges they had going into it.",
        "This movie was amazing. I couldn't imagine a more perfect follow-up to Infinity War or a more perfect ending to this 11 year, 22 film story arc. This movie is dramatic, it's emotional, it's hilarious, it's fun, it has great action, it's pretty much everything that you'd want out of one of these movies. I think I like Infinity War a little more, but this movie is a close second! That's pretty much all I can say without spoiling anything. This movie has many surprises and I don't want to give any of them away, so just go see it if you are even a little bit of a Marvel fan. As I've stated before, I'm not a big Marvel fan but I really connected with this movie in a pretty meaningful way. This is the film event of this generation. Don't miss it!",
        "It's the end of the story and the superhero. The old story is over and the new one is about to start. Let's take a few more steps on the path of memory. Old friends meet again. People who want to be superheroes become real superheroes. Lost time is also picked up in another parallel universe. There is no better ending.",
        "Wow, this film is a superb culmination of every single Avengers film. You possibly could've seen more of Captain Marvel but seeing as she's a late edition it didn't seem that out of place.\n\nI was amazed with the preemptive thought that went into this final edition. Every scene that passed, I had to take a breath, everything seemed to gel effortlessly, although at the same time seemed complicated. The film is a masterclass and I'm gutted, but as they say, all good things come to an end......",
        "After watching Avengers Infinity War everyone who watched that film had a question \"what is going to happen next?' and this film answer our every single question. This is not just a film, this an experience that you will never forget.",
        "Ranged from merely ok to messy and contrived. Disappointed they resorted to a time travel movie (was that the best they could come up with??). Hated what they did to Hulk and Thor. Hawkeye was irritating and Captain Marvel was hyped up for basically nothing... Infinity War was far far better.",
        "You literally should watch every other movie before this.",
        "This is by far my favorite movie ever every one NEEDS to go watch it in the theater there is so much action at times andyou will not be able to get everything on a normal screen ... It's not comparable to any thing else.. I laughed i cried and even after over 24 hours . I smiled when the battles happened i loved it all for a 3 hour movie you don't feel it.. I'm going to leave it here because i don't want to go spoilery",
        "Its different now without Iron Man. MCU have to make something new. its not just the graphics but the story.",
        "Get action sequences they are very good but too short and the same old stuff we've seen in the other movies. There is nothing epic about this movie. It is 1 hour too long, Ironman is just as annoying as always, they destroyed Thor's character and it was very boring in the first half. There is no comparison to Infinity war or the first captain America movie which had pace and great editing. Even die hard marvel fans have said end game is not what they wanted. I do appreciate this kind of movie brings customers out that don't normally venture to the cinema but this is pure marketing hype and people obviously do not watch a lot of movies to say it's amazing! Watch more decent movies folks!!",
        "Watching the coming attractions was depressing. No wonder kids are half brain-dead today. My only interest in anything Avengers is Benedict Cumberbatch. I thought this was a fun film, loved all the cameos and the actors are all very likable. Special effects were amazing, but for about a half hour there I felt like I was watching a video game.\n\nThought the script managed to have some poignancy and humor as well. And you have to see it in a theater.",
        "I am glad it's over. Please give some culture to younger generation now. It's enough with the cheesy dialogues, meaningless conversations, stupid jokes. It was an entertaining film but that's all. I liked watching the crazy visual effects, CGI and great landscapes from other planets. But just it's the end, they pushed so hard to show every character who was ever in a Marvel movie. And they tried to connect them into the storyline but it didn't work.",
        "If you invested in all of the films that came before it then you will probably be very happy. Are there plot holes? Sure. Is anything in the movie probable at all in the real world? No. It's a movie. Go into it with an open mind and enjoy the ride. Nice job Russo's.",
        "Some really good hype moments here and there but the movie plays out like expected. It's sadly very far from Infinity War quality, 7/10.",
        "This movie was great fun to watch. Exciting and action packed. If you like the series, it brings answers to many open questions.",
        "I have watched this movie three times already and I'm still GUSHING about it! To put it simply: I loved this movie 3000!!",
        "Epic, exciting and filled with love and gratitude for both the characters and the fans, \"Endgame\" is everything an event movie should be.",
        "This movie is very emotional and funny at the same time. We can see how much the characters have developed from the start of the MCU. I'm little dissapointed with the lack of fighting scenes and with the ending. I can say what scenes will make great memes. Thank you Marvel for this great period in my life and for all the great movies u created. Keep going on. P.s. Thanos in that garden reminded me of Shrek.",
        "This was an incredible ending to the Avengers saga. Plenty of story and action. An emotional roller coaster at times. The Avengers franchise has been the best superhero portrayal yet.",
        "The three hours I was in the movie theater were not in vain, I witnessed a masterpiece. This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen and surely one of the best movies ever. \ud83d\udc4d",
        "Echoing what many other reviews said, this was one of the few pop culture behemoths that lived up to its' hype... This was a fantastic conclusion to a wonderful 10 years of cinema from MARVEL (my only minute criticism would be that during multiple emotional scenes where crying was involved, I didn't see any tears -__-... But that's just me nit picking)",
        "The rumors are true: you'll laugh, cheer, and will probably cry several times because I did. A middling first 2 hours that's equal parts cool moments and problematic ones that ends with a final hour that's a downright divine geek wet dream. More character-based than action-based (Infinity War). It is a satisfying send-off and a beautiful love letter for the fans. Salute to the founding members- the OG 6. I love you 3000, Avengers. Thank you, Marvel and Russo Brothers!",
        "I do not see why everyone was giving the plot of this movie a 1 or 2 star. I can say watching this movie for 3 hours, it tied up all the previous movies all in one bow and left no questions unanswered. I think some viewers wanted more death scenes but for me I was truly satisfied and entertained since watching all the marvel movies at the start of first Ironman. You will definitely try to hold back some tears which I was good at but this movie will try to make you cry. Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did since this is the last avengers saga.",
        "Its an amazing movie to watch. Everything is so grand. Directors binded every piece amazingly well. There's right amount of humour and seriousness and its just blend so well. Cudos to Marvel team!! A must must watch to every marvel fan and those who are not in marvel can watch for its amazing action ,humour, grand scale cinematography and What not. In short a must watch for every one!",
        "The special effects are top notch, but the film is very bloated at 3 hours when its a simple tale of a cop out time travel ending. There exists a \"De-Feminized Fanedit\" that proves the point, at a little less than half the length it tells the same story in tighter and frankly more effective form. No random appearance of immersion breaking over powered mary sues and the rest, just a slog fight of actual avengers and superheros working together for a single goal because it's necessary, and not because some over powered character feels some kind of sick amusement at watching everyone else do most of the work. What could have been a perfect two part send off is marred by this modern faddish politics being inserted into all entertainment to its detriment, hopefully this will all soon pass and simply will be remembered as a strange marker of its times.",
        "Film full of emotions, happiness, fun, anger and sadness, there is a bit of everything",
        "Honestly, I think there are too many Heroes for one movie so Thanos definitely helped us out. That said, the writers do exceptionally well to weave all the back stories, relationships, characters and emotional hee-haw together in one crazy 3 hour rollercoaster ride of CG action, emotion and gags.\n\nGreat fun but I yearn for the simpler single hero movies of yore, even though I still think the first Avengers movie was the Greatest!!!\n\nThat said, this will break every box office record as it is a MUST SEE!!!",
        "OUTSTANDING bittersweet end to a long cinematic saga brilliant performances by RDJ ,,,,,SCARJO,,,,,CHRIS EVANS .... Well done to all the cast crew and the writers and directors of this film for pulling this story of and giving us the best that the MCU HAS TO OFFER.... I only hope that i can continue to follow along for the next phase hopefully THE MCU WILL avoid the SJW crap, BUT i fear that, that is where we are heading its been a wild ride and this might be my last stop.",
        "Terrible way to end such an amazing saga. Infinity War was excellent! This is so dull and full of massive plot holes. Personally I would've preferred to see a massive hunt to find and destroy Thanos with him playing a major part in the movie. Instead Thanos is confronted early on and then it's all a load of rubbish from there.",
        "Loved it. Perfect ending for this part of the saga.",
        "This is best superhero movie that I ever watch. The storyline was great and powerful with its emotion weight and great treatment to all the characters. If you think Infinity War is more to Thanos storyline,then don't be disappointed because this is the Avengers movie. The movie also bring us to the journey where you can remember the movie what it's supposed to be. 30 years from now, I guarantee that you will introduce and share the love of this movie to your child or grandchild.",
        "Best superhero movie created ever it has besrt screenplay, story, action and full entertainment like a perfect package",
        "Show some respect, I mean the movie is the best of its generation 3000 times. Why do people give it down ratings?!! This movie deserves the most 3000 more than you do.",
        "Just got back from the midnight showing and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I get that its the final avengers movie but they spent two hours paying homage to previous films and characters and retread a lot of the original plot. In doing so they effectively dulled Thanos's presence and much of the enjoyment of the movie. I hate to say it but Captain Marvel seemed like a useless addition as she really didn't bring much to the table and her presence ruins Thanos's threat. Anyway the production values were great and it was nice to see all the characters make an appearance in some form but it wasn't bet foot to go out on.",
        "After all this time, after all the movies, after all the laughs and battles we finally get to witness the end to the biggest movie saga of our lifetime. Never before has an endeavor so grand been accomplished and achieved. Avengers Endgame lived up to the expectations and all hype. Per usual Marvel form Wndgame provided a wonderful story filled with action, plenty of laughs and more stars than we could keep track of. This movie gave me chills and had me wondering what would happen next. I know phase four of the MCU is in our future but this culmination of over 10 years of movies was the pinnacle for me. I doubt Marvel will be able to top this story. I won't be spoiling anything here but just know there will be plenty of laughs, tears and tense moments. It's a fantastic ending to the Avengers story. Or is it?? Can't wait to see what comes next.",
        "Dont agree with what Marvel decided for Black Widow ..and no acknowledgement for her! Some Great scenes and twists! All around great! Boo on no post credit scenes!",
        "Due to the most recent release of Avengers: Endgame, the writer of this review has abstained from writing the movie review of this movie",
        "I dont know any movie that had a 3rd act better then this... the final battle made me feel like i was on 100 pounds of cocaine",
        "Have to say the best film I have ever seen. If you are prone to needing toilet breaks in the cinema wear a nappy!! As you cannot leave your seat watching it. Russo brothers thank you for delivering in my eyes a truly amazing experience and I have never had my emotions on such a rollercoaster ride watching a film. This reminds me of what a cinema experience should be as knew not much about what will happen and trailers didn't reveal the good bits. It was an epic and enjoyable film no need to stay for post credits either as there is none",
        "Is being overrated, kids love supper hero.7 for the action.",
        "Just a superb example of beautiful story telling!\n\n3 hrs passes in the blink of an eye, although you come out feeling like you have been put through an emotion wringer. Incredibly well done, even down to the appropriate, satisfying but not \"happy\" ending...\n\nJust see it - no - just see ALL of the MCU movies :-)",
        "Best movie ever watched in Cinema, Tihs movie got action , adventure and emotions which makes it perfect for a family to watch.",
        "This has to easily be my favourite MCU movie and I am so damn impressed with how they managed to pull it off that you care about everyone in it at all of the time. This film never stops and I even cared about and was into the action, which I rarely did before.\n\nI will rewatch this for sure, which I often don't want to do with most of Marvel, and absolutely don't know what to even say anymore. I love it, and as someone who likes superhero movies but often doesn't love them, that just blows me away.\n\nIt is so well put together, and just wow. I mean wow. I mean I fell asleep while watching a bunch of these flicks, surely not with this one. Three hours. And they made it work. That's so insane.",
        "I have to say that Endgame was enjoyable, albeit sometimes for the wrong reasons, yet this is to be expected when all the MCU is combined into this strange conclusion. The performances are very good, although one is left wondering what the point of introducing Captain Marvel was due to her lack of actual contribution to \"the grand plan\". I firmly believe that this could have been done better by postponing its release or splitting it into more parts so that the pacing, the tone and at times even the story wouldn't be so all over the place. However, I am glad to have seen the conclusion of the franchise and hopefully Marvel will continue to deliver great movies in the future.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is a superb wrap-up of 11 years of movies in the MCU. And its the type of movie, you will not forget seeing in a crowded theatre. The spectacle is amazing, the acting is amazing, the storylines are great and the emotional punch at the end is one for the ages.\n\nAvengers: Endgame lives up to the hype on all accounts. And it will be hard for any future Avengers movie to beat it in terms of pure spectacle and emotional payoff. This movie, just like the previous Avengers movie, is superhero cinema at its finest.",
        "Worth watching.. an emotional journey with lots of memories.. marvel's best movie ever..",
        "Although this is the usual Avengers fare it comes nowhere near the quality of the previous MCU outings. There are just too many characters in it. Hardly anybody gets a chance to develop. As much as I enjoyed other MCU movies, this one just felt like a bit of a chore. And the final half hour was just grindingly hard work as the camera worked its way through so many Marvel characters, that I wouldn't have been surprised to see all the X-Men, Daredevil, Jessica Jones and the full cast of the Beano thrown in for good measure. But it's still watchable - just.",
        "Although it was a satisfying ending of the same characters in MCU, other important protagonists get sidelined in ridiculous ways. The ending was very emotional, but the road there was a bumpy one. The Russo's did not capture the magic they did with Infinity War, but I guess it was good enough.",
        "I just going to experience best 3 hours in my life",
        "Oh my, these guys have done beautifully. I've never been so happy after a superhero movie, like ever. If you thought Infinitty War was awesome, wait until Endgame takes you to infinitty and beyond. Direction is flalwless, there is no part where you feel like \"waiting\". The screenplay has done a very nice job solving many question, although is not perfect. In any way you want to see it, The Avengers Endgame does not dissapoint, and it will be recalled as the best finale ever made for a saga, for many years to come",
        "Not much to say other than without a doubt the best Marvel movie made to date! A fantastic, emotional, well scripted film that will leave you feeling fulfilled.....but with also a couple of unanswered questions! I can't say anymore than go watch this film!",
        "Never ever miss this in theatres.Its not something we expected,it's too much above.Oxford should add a new word to describe such emotions.Never miss.Thank you marvel for making my day best of my life.",
        "The fight scene was epic! I had to rewatch it over and over!",
        "I want to get this out that I don't think marvel is overrated. Although I'm not a huge fan of the whole universe, I can understand why many are. I really like a great deal of the movies, my favourites is probably guardians 1 and 2 I'm very happy that this is a financial success, it's always fun to see marvel out do themselves at the box office, and this film is nearly the highest grossing movie of all time. Critically however I find this movie overrated, Unlike infinity war this film meanders a lot. Many of the jokes don't land and some of the scenes are down right stupid. I though the last action scene was great and the dialogue like usual is fun If you think this is the best movie ever I don't want to change your opinion, personally I cannot understand this being 0.5 ratings below the Godfather",
        "You probably heard people reviewing comic book movies with the line 'this scene is ripped straight out of the comic book page' and with endgame it couldn't be more true. i mean the story is touching, the battle is EPIC, and the jokes are funny. and i promise you there are SO MANY SURPRISES in this movie and they're all GREAT! i have some crazy hope and really high expectation and marvel exceeded all of them. you wont feel that its 3 hour long movie because its just so good! thank god i already had another ticket on sunday. the only critics i'd give is that i came 5 minute late :(",
        "Dont get me wrong I did enjoy the film the first hour and a half I felt was a bit pointless but then wow it was amazing so I feel 7 is all it deserves due to the start",
        "Before walking into the theater I thought of a dozen different ways this movie could possibly play out, but it was none of those. It progresses in a make-sense but surprising fashion that I've never seen in any other movies. Not to say it doesn't have plot holes, but I happily embrace it because I honest believe no one could've done a better job in writing the story. Great job Marvel and thank you for pulling this off!",
        "Best movie ever. Nonstop since the first second. I just watched it 2 hours ago and I'm still shaken and wired up about it. Definitely going to watch it again.",
        "People who don't even watched all pervious marvel movie and rate this movie . Maybe god bless you.",
        "The first 2 hours of the movie were pretty boring. Great last hour but, boy, was I ready to get to the final hour. Did love last scene with Cap America. Won't say anything more. CA:WS and first Avengers were my faves. This ranks probably #3 or #4 of the Marvel movies. Plus sweet cameo by Stan Lee. Would have been funnier if he had not died recently. Bitter sweet.",
        "I have thoroughly enjoyed the Marvel franchise over the past 13 or so years. I liked some movies better than others of course but still can't think of one I didn't watch at least twice. Endgame disappointed me. It was long, and boring. The time travel aspect was not at all believable, funny thing to say I know considering this is a movie about superheros but that's my take. Finally, the epic battle at the end had been done before much better in Ultron. Time to put this baby to bed. It had a good run though.",
        "Never thought that a superhero movie could make me as emotional as this one did. RDJ's turn as IronMan was brilliant. To see the character develop from the first IronMan movie to this iteration was a journey well worth taking. And to have the story wrap up with all the characters and plot lines coming together was mind-blowing. A modern classic that sucks you in from the word go.",
        "Well...after the depression one was left with after the Infinity War ended...This will make you clap your hand! Oops! I fear I might have mentioned too much! 3 hours it may be, but you will enjoy it. Make sure you go to the loo first before the movie start. Oh yes, if you are waiting for the credit scenes to roll...don't bother.",
        "Thank you for 10 years of great entertainment! Loved all the 22 movies and can't wait to see the next 22. A great ending to a 2 part movie. All was 5 stars, ALL! Masterpieces! Will rewatch all, forever... AVENGERS!",
        "After seeing it 3 times it does not have as many plot holes as i initialy thought. One of the most solid time travel plots. Really liked they made time travel with different timelines like in Dragon Ball Z and not like 12 monkeys, that would have removed any sense from it.",
        "End of the game End of the game End of the game End of the game End of the game End of the game",
        "Doesn't measure up to Infinity wars and has too many plot holes. is not that bad but i was expecting way more than what we got is like many promises were broken on this one.",
        "They are unhappy. Instead of movies bringing joy in their lives they just want their life problems spill over to others. Don't fall for it. This is a good movie.",
        "Think they've done the super hero thing to death and this one is no better or worse than any of the others, except it's a good 30 minutes too long. The CGI runs rampant as always, plot is ludicrous as they usually are with these things and if this truly is the final instalment it's come non too soon! A lot of young people love these kind of films of course and good luck to them, me, I'd prefer a good western!",
        "There aren't many words to describe how this film made me feel, but it definitely was the perfect ending for the Infinity Saga and it makes me incredibly excited for what is yet to come.",
        "Sucks like booty. Jackhammer.dhdhdhxh.\n\nShae did usual sudbaoe.",
        "What an amazing movie marvel have really use the power of it's own movie if every mistake in the others movie was just to give us these amazing moving picture then I will give all marvel movie he same rate.",
        "The hype held up, if you are a marvel fan you will love this end to the cinematic universe.",
        "This movie was a very strange experience for me. It wasn't bad but also was not good either. There are constant attempts at humor that feel forced and unnatural (most of Rocket's dialogue feels that way). The whole movie felt like it was saying good-bye instead of building the story. The action scenes were pretty bad. Sure, lots of special effects and great CGI but again, there was nothing supporting any of that. It's the worst Avengers movie and while it might have generated some box office revenue, the story and dialogue are completely forgettable.",
        "Best movie I see him ever this movie He deserves ten Academy Awards.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is a culmination of 11 years of cinematic superhero movies that have entertained us on different levels all throughout the years. 22 movies come to an explosive ending here and if the word 'epic' ever had any meaning, this movie would be it. Truly a visceral experience that leaves you heartbroken and shocked from all the events and the insane number of characters and story-lines that they intervene. I loved pretty much everything about this movie, it was indeed a bit slow at the start but I didn't mind as the ending is probably the most spectacular thing I have ever experienced in a cinema. Everyone does an amazing job at acting, but my stand out would be Jeremy Renner who truly shines as Hawkeye. The Russo brothers have accomplished an incredible feat and the entire 181 minutes of this film, serve as minutes that will go down in the history of cinema for decades to come.",
        "OK I know there's a lot of hype for this movie but when you look past the fact that we've all been super excited because we've been waiting for a long time and you stop to think about what you just watched, there's a whole bunch of things that don't make sense. The effects are insane the movie itself is beautiful but I really hate the storyline and how they decided to go with it.",
        "As all of you have been, I've been waiting for this movie for a long long time. We've all had our expectations set high, and let me just say you could not see anything coming your way. Avengers Endgame is the perfect culmination of the eleven years of movies Marvel has given us, perfectly balanced, as all things should be. You're gonna cry, you're gonna laugh, you're gonna be surprised. Solid 10/10.",
        "That movie was so emotional, yet full of action. Funny, yet deep with meaning. The plot line was so well thought out, that it gave you the impression it's impossible for a human brain to actually pull this off. Every little detail clicked, every scene had its meaning. I've never laughed and cried and were at the edge of my seat all at the same time, in a single movie. I thought it was gonna be just a re-do, a battle and then bye-bye Avengers era. But, no. It was so much more. It was an epic way to mark a 10 year old journey. Russo brothers, you blew me away. You better get an oscar for that screen writing. Oh, and RDJ you are a brilliant actor. You deserve all the millions they gave you. EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY.",
        "Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.",
        "Best superhero movie ever made, i laugh, i cried, it gave me goosebumps, just an outstanding movie, pure art by Russo Brothers, great ending for a great series, just want to thanks Marvel, Stan Lee, Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo for this amazing 11 years, Avengers is not just a movie for us, its an emotion, i grew up watching this. Endgame worth every penny ,every seconds , just bring tissue paper ,you will definitely cry. LOVE YOU 3000 TIMES!!!",
        "Wow... All i can say is that the movie ended my entire childhood in the most perfect way!! It kept you on your feet the whole way through!! Marvel somehow manages to add comedy to the most intense situations. its Awesome!! The battle scene was out of this world!! I just... wow.. Thank you marvel. I love you 3000!!! ROBERT DOWN JUNIOR WON THE HERO OF THE YEAR AWARD THIS YEAR LAST WEEK AT THE MTV MOVIE AND TV AWARDS!!",
        "This is an amazing film, which I did really enjoy, and I don't think that story wise it could have been improved. But have to admit that I did prefer Infinity War. I suspect that it managed to maintain such a high octane pace throughout, this one understandably needed a slower pace for the exposition. Also there was just a bit too much humour - the consequences of the previous film are clearly devistating for those left, so the switch to more light hearted banter did not always sir so well with me. Still a must see film and a remarkable example of the true cinematic talent of Russos.",
        "The part 2 to avengers 3 and what should've been avengers 3 as well really impressed me\n\nalthough i didn't enjoy it as much as the first part, i do really think that it was still a good movie.\n\nThe problem is that i have to have motivation to watch it and that's because it's 3 hours long\n\ni'm just saying if they tacked it along side avengers infinity war and sold that in stores, that would be the golden ticket move.",
        "It's just great, I don't want to spoil anything, just trust me. But to make it even better, watch the first iron man and captain America: the first avenger again if you already have or for the first time (and obviously you have to have seen infinity war, but you don't need to rewatch it if you have already seen it)",
        "They out did themselves with infinity war nothing would ever top that but this. Was good.",
        "How is it even possible that someone that watch marvel movies watches this film and does not like it? Honestly I think that some of these reviews are from competitors. The movie is really a masterpiece. 3 hours of a great work. 10/10 is the least I can give!",
        "There really are no words that anyone can use to describe this film. But if I had to put it into one word, it would be \"Spoilers\". See it if you haven't.",
        "This was amazing don't think they'll make a film like this ever again I cried laughed all the way Avengers........ Assemble \ud83e\udd19",
        "Yay! This ends the marvel movie franchise! What? It's doesn't. Ugh. Oh well, at least this wraps up a lot, ends the major villain plot, has a few laughs, and gives everyone a moment to shine. Sure it has a million logic and continuity flaws, but who cares when you're breezing through so fast. Doesn't feel like three hours and well worth watching. That said, I never want to see another marvel movie let alone re-watch one.",
        "A spectacular conclusion to the first three phases of the MCU. A ton of action and emotion makes this one of the best Superhero movies anyone will ever watch. While it is easy to get sidetracked by the hype around this movie there are plot holes that will make you scratch your head. Personally this movie is one of the best cinematic experiences ever. I laughed, I cried and I clapped.",
        "Good performances, good dialogue driven scenes, nicely written emotional scenes, stunning visuals and an incredible third act. Such a wonderful culmination to 11 years of film making.",
        "Just another dumb kids movie, with some tacked-on grrl power BS. Quite disappointing and unnecessarily overlong. I was surprised to see Supergirl make a cameo appearance, especially in a Marvel movie.\n\nSomething for the teens to get excited about, but a long 3 hours for any intelligent adult.",
        "I've never cried so much in anything (well, since Bambi in 1992), amazing film. I can't give away any details, but it's just perfect",
        "This is for the MCU fans, a truly heartfelt, emotional 3 hour journey into characters we have grown to love over the last 11 years. It's not perfect, they took huge risks, some I didn't like, others I loved! A Few things to know: It's light on action (until the last hour) In favour of telling a slower story and letting the characters simmer in a scene. Take tissues Don't take a toilet break There are no after credit scenes. Overall I loved this movie. It's a fantastic and satisfying conclusion. 9/10 Where I rank this in the 4 Avengers movies - 1st Where I rank this in the MCU - 2nd",
        "If you are comic book reader you know that there is never an end. The story always goes on somehow. When you have Stan Lee before your eyes, adventure is jusr the beginnning of something bigger than the pages and wider than the screen. As a motion picture, though, it brings all sorts of predicability and clich\u00e9s of its genres but emotion will guide you throughout the movie and leave us with the certatinty that with great power comes the greatest sacrifice.",
        "I actually don't know how I can review this movie in words, I really loved watching it. I didn't watch the other avengers movies, but that wasn't necessary, the story and the plot was great and I understood it very well.",
        "This movie was genious for some reason,less action i know.but at the end this movie was a masterpiece on many ways,ill be waiting for more marvel movies for now.",
        "The story line was mostly boring, the characters (banner and Thor) were embarrassing and I missed the funny dialogues.",
        "I was pessimistic and fatigued with Marvel in the past few years, but Endgame is the most enjoyable movie since the original standalone films way back when the MCU was first being set up. Where Infinity War was lacking in terms of tension, Endgame picks up the slack, with tightly bound scenes and interesting twists and turns. Characters act in logical ways and it is simply a joy experiencing and sharing in their time on screen. This was a far more fulfilling experience than I expected and I was really won over by the fantastic acting and the meticulous attention to detail in every scene.",
        "This movie was epic in every sense of the world. Most importantly it was the end of an odyssey started over ten years ago. Genius! Well done!",
        "After watching Avengers Endgame , I am ready to say, with all my heart, that this movie is the most unique, fun, touching and satisfying movie ever... Oh and it's not only the best superhero movie ever, it's the best movie in history \ud83d\ude4c --- ASSEMBLE!",
        "Funny. Lovely. Action. Epic and at the same time full of meaning. Everything is going perfect",
        "Imma be honest: I was afraid this movie would be boring, overly sentimental and poorly written, but luckily IT IS NONE OF THOSE THINGS!! They managed to fill the surprisingly long run-time without boring the audience, and the plot managed to round up the character's stories very well. I was happy when I left the theatre even though the movie obviously had some sad parts. Before seeing it, I was worried I had hyped myself too much and would be disappointed, but instead I am glad that it ended in such a perfect way. Anyone who claims otherwise should be burned alive.",
        "I'm not a huge Marvel fan, so I don't know if I'm missing anything, but it was decent.\n\nBut, it was far too long and I struggled to sit through the last 45 minutes or so. If they cut out all the filler, it would've only been 2 hours long, not 3. I also didn't like how the scriptwriters and filmmakers couldn't really work out if they wanted the movie to be serious, emotional and epic, or filled with a hundred funny but silly jokes to pad the run-time.\n\nRegardless, I still enjoyed it. The plot was good, the jokes were funny, the CGI was good, and the soundtrack was decent. It was definitely better than Captain Marvel.",
        "I can't give more than 5/10 to a time travel movie that can't get time travel right.",
        "The Russo Brothers did an amazing job on this film the action sequences are so good, but the movie is basically 2 hours of comedy and 30 minutes of action, the movie also forgets about the snap and everyone's making jokes again. The ending was really good. The film pays a good tribute to the Characters and their actors.\n\nIt's good but not that good.",
        "But I don't think it's as great as Infinity War which I think it might be better than LOTR, but still a great and amazing movie to watch, you won't regret watching it! Congrats to Russo brothers! Good job!! Thanks to Stan Lee....",
        "The dedication and acting of the cast was incredible! The score was phenomenal! Such a heartbreaker and a tear. Great movie, I do think infinity war was better.",
        "After the disappointing \"age of ultron\", infinity war was a breath of fresh air. Endgame,however, feels like a rush job, playing on the cliche time travel trope. The writers for endgame were better off letting Thanos keep the stones and having the avengers deal with their losses for the first half of the movie. I would of love to see thanos get to utilize the different stones and their abilities, instead of having the movie turn into \"battle for the snap\". The cliche girl power moment towards the end of the film was also cringe, you already did that in infinity war so it doesn't have that same impact this time around. Also the confusion, if there are 3 different tesseract's for the sake of plot, does that mean there are three different thanos? does the snap only defeat that timelines thanos or does he still exist in other timelines? The movie had it's moments, but i didn't leave feeling excited about it like infinity war, and once again the black order is useless, but whatever i'll still show up for avengers 5.",
        "Must Watch Excellent Work by stars. Good movie but its last part of movie.",
        "Never has so much been spent on glorious VFX to service an orgy of Deus Ex Machina in order to fulfill the standard juvenile Hollywood ending that the good guys always win. Such a pure, white bread, immature ending, I'm embarrassed for Marvel that so much effort went into an ending dumbed down for pre-teens. What's the point of all this comic-book-to-big-screen-madness if there's no doubt of the outcome?! I suppose they TRY to make it look difficult for the heroes but then you throw in never-done-before quantum-based time-travel and voila, good guys prevail. Such a colossal waste of story-telling, of sci-fi adventure. My soul weeps.",
        "Avengers: Endgame, ends a saga that has been created since Iron Man released in 2008, the film starts as it should start in a breathtaking scene. Throughout the film we show how the world was after the snap of thanos, or what the universe of marvel calls: the blip, in the first act of the film focuses more on the avengers trying to reverse the snap of thanos and also has some very epic scenes and many references in the second act of the film, finally the war which we have waited for 11 years and 22 films. The final scenes are simply one of the best scenes in the history of cinema. Anyway, Avengers: Endgame is the biggest event in the history of cinema, the best superhero film in history and deserves the box office that it won, what I think is bad that Avengers was despised in the awards, but for Marvel it doesn't matter, for me Avengers: Endgams is a film made as a declaration of love to fans and an end of a cycle and one started a new.",
        "Not As Per Expectation ..the story is not that much catchy....only 4d effects of war scenes were amazing",
        "Avengers: Endgame is the ultimate showdown to what marvel had built over the past 11(12 at the time of this review) years. The characters that you know and love all facing off against the Mad Titan himself, in a do or die mission. Each character has his or her unique backstory and has different emotions and empowering motives to do justice. It's got a ton of action, but what's amazing is that it's got more character as well. It builds up to the finale, but it's the build up and suspense that leaves us in awe.\n\nThis movie will make you cheer and make you shed a tear.",
        "For a 3hr film it flies by. Ties up the MCU nicely and the best film I have seen in a while. Highly recommend",
        "Literally amazing in every way. You've read all the reviews. And you're living under a rock if you haven't seen it yet.\n\n\n\nJUST GO SEE IT!",
        "Best movie ever, The best i've ever seen.\n\nF F\n\nF C F F.",
        "I love this movie. ..hope there will be another one like this",
        "Just to give you some advice anyone who is thinking about seeing this film they need to watch the past Avenger films from the start.\n\nThe storyline might be a little bit of getting used to but overall it is still a great plot for a Avengers film. After the end of Infinity War it was good to see how the characters had moved on and how the world is picking up the pieces of what had happened. When the sh*t goes down in terms of the action it really is on par and in some aspects beats Infinity War in terms of the diversity and the use of what each character is shown to do.\n\nOverall a solid Avengers Film",
        "No comment needed.\n\nBest MCU ever. Chris Evans i love you. Robert downey jr you're da bomb. Chris Hemsworth. Scharlett johanson, she is my spirit animal.",
        "After watching all the previous movies related to this one, I was excited to see this one. The crazy ending of Infinity War left me moody and waiting for answers.\n\nEndgame is funny, sad and major! I laughed so much watching this and shred some tears. If you have seen previous movies you can totally get all the jokes and winks toward us Marvel fans :)\n\nWorth to watch at least three times! I seriously can not get over this movie!",
        "This film is a Super Movie but if you didnt watch other avengers Movies dont watch it. It full of wonderfull moments like the war of thanos",
        "As the title states. The climax of this film is the most important part. Something the whole previous 2 and a half hours builds up to. To have it spoiled by an all powerful character, who can just swoop in and destroy whole spaceships, takes away all the suspense and hence, in my opinion, all the fun.\n\nThere is a reason even superheroes are flawed. Even they struggle and fail. It's to allow us to identify with them.\n\nI loved Infinity War, but this I will not see again.",
        "Let me get this straight, this movie is totally overhyped and I don't recommend wasting the 2 hours of your precious life just for an enjoyable last 40 minutes of the final battle. Even the final battle wasn't up to the mark, after an unimaginablely awesome portal scene we get 10 minutes of entire 10 years of MCU just punching, that's it which suddenly ends by sacrifice of iron man, and marvel even wasted a character like Spiderman. And did the death of black widow had any influence, I don't think so, an awesome character who ended up as a glamor in the movies. Overall this movie is a no go, if you want to watch it, go for the last 40 minutes, the rest is crap.",
        "What a movie. The way the Russo Brothers has brought in the emotions, as well as the action scenes. Brilliant Screenplay, what an acting by all the actors especially, Robert Downey Jr. 3 hrs just flew, I did not get bored in any part, an engaging movie. VFX was great, Marvel has not compromised with its VFX. The best Avengers movie when compared with the other three. A visual treat for all the Marvel fans. Loved it.",
        "Even though there are still many obnoxious details that bother me a lot like; people refusing to kill one another just so they can say one more glorious line, the whole time traveling thing that makes the entire story meaningless or the overly predictable character realizations of giving up hope but then suddenly changing their minds; I have to admit it was entertaining. What I also have to admit is that its not easy to make a 3-hour-action-movie not feel like a 3-hour-action-movie with correctly balanced audio-visual dynamics.\n\nRemaining Avengers have to travel in time and try to fix what they couldn't prevent in the past.",
        "This is a movie best enjoyed on the Big screen, with a large audience. We can nitpick and overanalyze small plot details, but overall, Marvel Studios has delivered a great experience. To tie all these movies together, as best they could, is no small achievement. As more people continue to stay home and stream content, this movie is a reminder of the true power of cinema.",
        "I agree with many other reviews in that this Avengers is over hyped. However, this movie IS STILL REALLY GOOD. I think a lot of people are giving it bad reviews because people had too high of expectations. Infinty War was a lot more action-packed and became a legendary film partly because Thanos's victory had such a large \"wow factor\" to it. In terms of pure enjoyment, infinity war takes the cake. However, the plot to endgame is really good and the action scenes are still pretty amazing.\n\nHonestly, my main disappointment with this movie is what they did to Thor's character. Thor was an amazing character in IW but in endgame he is kind of pathetic, DESPITE becoming one of the most powerful avengers by the end of IW. Personally, I wish they had found a better way to use Thor's character in this movie.",
        "This movie was good for an ending of a franchise but dont think it lives up to the hype, I found it boring and hard to keep me watching.",
        "The words can never describe how awesome the movie was. I brought my own diaper to last the 3 hour movie.",
        "I cannot believe the reviews of this movie. I almost walked out of this film and I loved comics growing up. It's so hard to watch no fun very slow and boring with a stupid plot horrible script it's actually embarrassing for how far they've come to finish off this way. They tried so hard to make it sentimental and failed miserably. It should have been 30 minutes and focused on Hawkeye. I didn't feel anything but numb. Oh and of course they had to throw in girl power on steroids I nearly threw up. Watching Captain America iron Man Thor and hulk look and act so pathetic for the mass majority of the movie was painful.",
        "I saw a many houndred of movies in my life. And there are a lot of them, they were really brilliant. But this year, Avengers Endgame filled up the whole year at the beginning.\n\nGreat, Fantastic, Actors, Directors, Camera, Sound, SFX, Music. Alan Silvestri. One of the best scores since Forrest Gump.\n\nThe Ending Scene is so full of love. I am really impressed. I was laughing, crying. So much of it. Thank you Marvel Studis, Thx Disney to feature this finale.\n\nPeople, I love you 3000",
        "Movie starts slow, continues with the mix of action and emotion and finally ends with a epic war!!!",
        "I like this movie too much. so delicate, so perfect, I cried several times, I have to watch it a few more times.",
        "I'm so grateful that in my lifetime I'm able to follow this journey of a epic superhero story. I salute every single one that made this possible from the beginning. It's not easy to keep all the actors working together over a few years to deliver something as big as this. And there isn't a single thing that I don't like about this movie. I won't say more but I believe many of you will be blown away like I was. Go watch it!!",
        "An emotional roller coaster from start to finish. You can't find a better ending to the Avengers saga.\n\nDON'T MISS IT",
        "Was a great end to the Avengers Series. There was laughter, humour, action, comedy, along with emotions. This had it all. Not sure what the buzz about Captain Marvel was but was quiet irrelevant to this story in my opinion. Hulk, Thor stole the show for me. Iron Man and Cap great as always. The 3 hours flew past. I give it a 9/10 just because of Captain Marvel spoiling it.",
        "Loved this movie as I have loved all other Avengers movies...bar one..Captain Marvel. So glad she (Brie Larson) was only in it for a short time or I would have scored it less. Loved the humour and the old familiar Avenger Heroes. Chris Helmsworth was hilarious. Robert Downey Jnr was brilliant as were the others.",
        "The best of marvel, a rollercoaster of emotions im not yet recovered of this epicness. Very good even if you dont like suoerheroes movies",
        "The movie is good. I think Disney gets that fans felt that Captain Marvel is an intruder within the series. Iron Man and Captain America lead the show with class and good dialog. Nebula steals the film in my estimation. There's a little pandering towards an all female avengers film but it doesn't hurt the film in general. So why 7? I didn't like the treatment they gave to Thor. I think that was lazy writing.",
        "This is one of the most ambitious movies ever put to screen and boy does the ambition pay-off. I can see this movie pleasing both hardcore MCU fans and causal viewers however you at least need to see Infinity war before watching Endgame. The acting, visual effects and overall story were great and will have probably set the bar for all superhero films to come. The only place I could see problems with the film were with the tone and pacing but they were just minor issues that are more than likely to happen with a 3 hour film. This movie is definitely worth the watch and is sure to be an instant classic.",
        "I had high expectations. Infinity War was great in comparison to this one. Sadly, Endgame feels like less.",
        "Im not a huge Marvel fan, but i like to watch their movies, and after seen Infinity War, i can say, this was worst. The first couple of hours was just fill time and i wasnt enjoying that much. The last hour, with the battle and all the events, it trully become really good. So, a 7 for hour 1 and 2, and a strong 9 for the last.",
        "I will write this without giving a single spoiler. As many of us Marvel fans have started this journey over 10 years ago, I can confidently say that we have grown up and grown so very attached to each character. We've connected with these Superheroes on so many levels, love, joy, happiness, and so many laughs. I'm usually a tough critic with movies, but I cannot say any other than this wasn't just an amazing Marvel movie; But an amazing movie in general. Every aspect of this movie brings you so much closer to the Hero's we fell in love with as children and showed us why they are hero's. This is a must watch Movie. And as funny as this sounds, this Superhero movie was Beautiful, thought invoking, motivational and so very loving. We could not have asked for anything better. Lastly I will say is, Marvel gave us a perfect start to the world of Marvel and most importantly a complete and perfect start. I honestly want to thank every single person involved with this masterpiece and say how much I appreciate what we e been given.",
        "7.2/10 \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf7f I admit, this movie was good. I didn't like infinity War but this was an improvement on both Sadness and characters. Black Widow and Hawkeye were much better in this than any other film!",
        "Good film. It could be great if there was not that much idiot jokes and that Thor was threared as non idiot. And everyone who says this is better than Nolan's trilogy is idiot. Anyone who says this is better than Man of steel or BvS or Watchmen is also an idiot.",
        "AE is the Final battle of Infinity Saga which concluded the story of every movie since 2008. The time travel explanation was good.It felt like Inception. The ending was the most fulfilling for Iron Man and Captain America. This movie couldn't have been better. The only problem with this movie was with the dubbed version in Hindi, they made the crap out of it, it was the worst dubbing ever. Please Marvel India take this into consideration. Love you 3000",
        "It was slow for most of the movie. Infinity War was way better.",
        "This film is a very satisfying finale to 11 years of build up. The acting as always is amazing. The film as some great action sequences (especially the final fight). The film is able to combine the comedy that most of the other marvel universe films have and has very emotional drama. Overall Avengers:Endgame is a spectacular conclusion to the infinity saga that also has a lot of great fan service packed in to it and it does not drag even with a 3 hour runtime.",
        "Totally worth a watch and it caps the series off well but it's pacing is a bit erratic for my tastes.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what comes in the new phases. I won't say more because this movie deserves to have none of the secrets spoiled.\n\nGo see it guys.",
        "Move was good but not great. Lots of plot holes and movie felt way too dragged out. No real surprises since you saw everything coming. My son and I would rate this as the 3rd best Avengers movie. Infinity war being better and the original.",
        "This movie is near perfect. It doesn't work without the MCU films that came before it, but if you've seen them all, WOW. packs a serious emotional punch. Fun, funny, sad, I got all the feels.",
        "A must see, Best movie ever!!!! I really think this is the best super hero movie ever made!!! Thank you Marvel",
        "I LOVE MARVEL!!! This movie is incredible!! I just wish Stan lee was here to see everything he had worked to create!!",
        "One of the best movies I've ever seen , simply EPIC , Enough said",
        "So much to see here, lots going on. First movie in years where I did not allow myself a 5 minute potty break. amazing and original and impactful. the best!",
        "This is truly cinema. It's a movie that makes us want to go to thw theaters multiple times to watch and rewatch. It's a reward to years of dedication by fans and moviemakers in a new form of storytelling unlike anything before and unlike anything to come. There hasn't been and there won't be anything like Avengers storyline ever again. Martjns Scorcese is just an old mummy jealous that this movie almost made 3 billion in box office, while his Irishman was too boring that we sleep 3 times before concluding it. Also, I'm sorry James Cameron, but Avatar is terrible when compared to this.",
        "In next episode I expect Micky Mouse to win fight with Hulk. Most ridiculous Marvel movie ever !!!",
        "No superhero fan will be disappointed with this movie!",
        "9.4/10 on imbd - probably voted by avengers fans.\n\nThis is a very average movie, weak storyline, no depth.",
        "Great movie. Heroes are perfect, high-level acting. In general, the film deserves 10 stars, but DC has, as always, included a scene of capturing a hero who is not killed. It's a weird decision to make if you know it's found in other movies in this movie universe.",
        "A beautiful ending to a legendary story. No spoilers from me, a must watch. 100,000,000/10",
        "Since we started watching Iron man when we were teens up until now 11 years and 22 movies all those came to success for this movie Endgame. If it is not like this there can't be any other better ending.\n\nAll of the hard work was worth it. And RDJ you made us marvel fans and you made the mcu what it is today.",
        "The end of an era. It was a good movie but probably infinity war was better.",
        "This movie is everything. It's funny, sad, heartbreaking, heartwarming, and so amazing. Stunning visuals and storyline, Endgame is basically a must watch and it was a wonderful experience for me watching it.",
        "I rated #Avengers : Endgame (2019) 5/10. Super heroes play best 2 out of 3 with #Greenpeace rapture man and set up about 2 dozen prequels and sequels so the $ train can continue.",
        "This emotional ending is perfectly balanced with the action packed setup from Infinity War. Marvel did an amazing job making an often-surprising and satisfying movie to tie up all the plot threads. There is nothing quite like the MCU and this movie displayed how far Marvel has taken each of its characters relationships throughout the last 10 years. Loved it!",
        "Does this movie have loopholes, of course it does - nothing is perfect but you tend to ignore them and focus on the pure joy and excitement you get from watching this movie. So many emotions and how they connected their very first movie to the last (no spoilers) - it was sheer brilliance.\n\nA job very very well done. Didn't disappoint.",
        "The movie is nothing less than a 10, if anyone says otherwise they crazy. I mean it's so cool, it has everything. A true mcu fan will most definitely cry because its simply amazing......",
        "Lets be truly honest, it's ok, it's too long, see it once.\n\n...and many things are just too absurd ... Thor's storyline for one. Nebula's story line for two.\n\nActing was fine. Everyone was fine. But you'd think for a three hour movie there would be more inter-Avenger dialog, especially between Natasha and Cap and Clint and Banner because she's attempted relationships with all three and now that half the people are gone and she cries a lot don't you think any of the other three would want to have a relationship?\n\nFrankly Infinity War was at least as good.",
        "It is a great movie, 3 great hours, but not great acting, there is no acting, just super heros costumes",
        "Best Avengers movie in my opinion. Loved it and ignore the bad ratings.",
        "I won't add any spoilers. It was a great marvel movie, but not one of my favorites. They had so much information to try and wrap into three hours, that they just left gapping plot holes. 2nd half of the movie rocked, but still massive plot holes.",
        "Very long and boring ..... frankly disappointed me ... I left with the thought of seeing action as in the first part ... but almost he was sleeping ...",
        "After 21 movies, this epic saga has come to an end. Avengers Endgame is one of the finest superhero movie ever made. The movie perfectly captures what made this franchise so unique and dear to all the fans. The movie is packed with humor, emotional moments and offcourse some epic battles. Those who are the old fans will obviously love this movie but the new ones who haven't seen any marvel movie would still find something good. Overall this movie is not just an movie but an experience. An experience of lifetime which can only be enjoyed on the largest screen possible.",
        "It was ok, but not living up to all the hype. The fiirst movie was much better in my humble opinion.",
        "Never before has a movie made my jaw drop so many times before nor made me want to jump up and down in the theater like a kid on Christmas morning!",
        "I'm not really a fanboy but I couldn't resist watching all the movies. And it is true: -the three hours feel like less -emotion is insane (I had tears in my eyes too) -acting is impressive -action is awesome -finale is epic and moving\n\nGo watch this best marvel and superhero film and enjoy the top of 22 films!",
        "More commercial film. The film did not output well. It could not work very well. It is mostly a film that has its own special audience. The whole movie could have been better. If there were no important actors in the film, I would give it a score of 2, but I gave the film a score of 4 because of the presence of lovely characters in the film.",
        "THIS IS A NON SPOILER REVIEW Avengers Endgame picks up where Infinity War has ended. It's full of story, full of heart and full of respect for the characters that we know and love profoundly. It's also beautiful to look at and has much better editing than most of Marvel. There are beautiful long shots and it's a spectacular view. If you love Marvel, if you have seen all (and in this case I recommend seeing all MCU movies before this one - trust me, it will help you understand many parts) then you are probably going to love this. And the marketing did do it justice - it really feels like an end of an era.",
        "This was the first time that I watched the film of this series and I was feeling bad about what I have missed by not watching any of the movie of this series. The VFX, CGI work is amazing because of which it looks amazing on screen especially in 3D",
        "It has taken many years and lots of work to build up to this amazing movie. This completely satisfied and exceeded my expectations for how I hoped they would pull this all off. I have been a huge fan of the movies leading up to this and this did it all justice. All the hidden \"Easter eggs\" from the other installments have been hinting towards this and I can't believe how big this has all gotten over the years. I was glad to see that even though this movie had a very serious fight at hand that there was still some classic Marvel comedy that made for some very funny moments. There was laughter, tears, and cheers through this movie. It was an emotional roller coaster that I already plan on going to again soon in theaters. It is a must see for those who have already been fans of the MCU and if you haven't followed it to this point this movie won't make sense or mean much to you so go back and watch the other movies. It is all worth it.",
        "Just watched avengers endgame for the second time (still watching the credits) and the first 2/3 made so much more sense!! Been about 6 weeks since I last seen it and I loved it then too! (More so the fight scenes but now I've gotten much more clarity on those marvel Easter eggs!! Very well executed and very smartly orchestrated too!!",
        "To anyone who went to see Iron Man in theaters when it came out,, and then followed the continuing journey as each new film debuted,,, this movie was the PERFECT conclusion (to what we've seen so far).\n\nIn Infinity War,, Thanos took all our hearts and ripped them to pieces! Well this one begins right after those events.\n\nWhere to begin?!? I really can't say much w/o giving away spoilers,,, so if there's anyone out there who hasn't seen this masterpiece,,, WATCH IT ALREADY!!!",
        "I've always been a fan of comics either DC or marvel i was fan of both and supported both sides but to be honest The MCU is way better than the DCEU dont get me wrong but DC got a good future as i saw in aquaman and shazam but to see how all these 22 movies of the MCU just connect and reach its peak is just pure gold a great ending to a great era and i just can't wait what the phase 4 is going to bring us",
        "If you are a marvel fan: you will watch it anyway, STOP LOOKING FOR SPOILERS And if you aren't a marvel fan: go watch every marvel movie ever right now. Stop reading. GO!!!",
        "I'll make it short , If you are still deciding either to go watch the movie or not then , don't go ... wait till the DVD release and watch it on a Friday night, after work , while you are so tired , sitting on your couch and you will have a nice nap at the first 1.5 hours of the movie then you will wake up like you missed nothing at all and you might enjoy the rest of the movie . The movie as they announced before is completely different than the infinity war , it's the difference between the east and the west plus if you really care about the previous MCU movies and the characters in them, you might also avoid watching that movie at all. The only way to watch that movie without getting disappointed is to forget that it's related to the MCU or Marvel comics ! I've advised you ...",
        "I don't know what it is about this film but it's just amazing.",
        "I can say is this was one of the best cinema experiences of my life. I don't think you can top the ending of this movie. My jaw was on the floor, e writhing I've ever wanted in a comic book film.",
        "This movie and Infinity War may be the most anticipated movies i've ever seen and this was simply the perfect ending.",
        "This movie hits all the right moves and I couldn't have been happier with how they concluded this Marvel chapter.",
        "I remember the first day I went to the cinema like it was yesterday, I was very excited. Avengers end game is a very special movie for me, although the ending was a bit sad, it was a great movie with battle scenes. As an avengers fan, I recommend it.",
        "Well! There are lots of good things about the film worth mentioning: VFX, lines, cinematography etc. Even the story itself was kind of good. However, the film was overwhelmed with PC and diversity factors and principals. And because of that the film has no soul ... seems something missing or something was no right! I am wondering if PC and Diversity ever stop ruining movies? It seems they won't stop unless they have already ruined and/or spoiled all the heroes we have had for decades.",
        "The movie was exhilarating, super fantastic, stupendous, I liked everything about it. Well done Russo brothers, you'll have ended the saga in a way that's very brilliant yet heart breaking. Phenomenal job, everything was directed in right proportions and where it has to be, full marks to the cast and crew of the movie and everybody else who contributed towards making this movie possible. Worth every minute spent in watching this movie! Thanking the Russo brothers again.",
        "Obviously anyone who has spend years watching MCU movies would go to watch Endgame with high hopes. I went with a hope to have a logical but entertaining end to the saga. I was disappointed. These are my impressions: Movie is 3 hour long but 50% of time is wasted on whining actors who have all but given up after their losses (during the previous movie!) Guys, we already know what happened there, now move on. Film makes these heroes pitiful, sad and tired looking humans- Thor is epitome of what I mean. Well, we have enough of those in real lives and we don't show up at 11 pm to watch that! Storyline was silly and predictable. I wanted to see the re-match between Avengers and Thanos but that was poorly done and I don't even understand how it abruptly ended!\n\nPositives were some funny moments.",
        "Amazing film with an unexpected twists, i have never expected this ending",
        "This movie was freakin awesome!!!!! I can't believe it was 3 hours long. The story was so good that it went by fast. It had a little bit of everything. I gotta see it again and I need it as soon as it's available to purchase. If you haven't watched all of the past Marvel films, do that first so you're not lost but I promise you will enjoy this film either way.",
        "This movie was a 10/10 in 3D iMax on the opening weekend. Simply one of my favorite movie experiences",
        "The most epic MCU story ever made! Thanks to russo's brother for directed well. And thanks to K Feige, to chose russo's brother.",
        "This movie is beyond the expectation. I think this statement is enough to get an idea without any spoilers that how is the movie.",
        "For me, Avengers: Endgame is honestly the greatest, most thrilling and epic film of the MCU, the battle scenes and performances shown were never done before in Marvel cinematic history and they will leave you with so much surprises!\n\n11 years in the making and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It exceeded everyone's expectations and even the comic book nerd ones!\n\nGo see it while you can because you will NEVER ever experience something like this in a movie theatre this breath-taking and shocking.\n\nIt also had such an amazing and satisfying wrap-ups to the major characters of the MCU. Couldn't ask for a better movie and a better way to end this hell-of-a journey.",
        "Man oh man what a movie ! cant believe im alive to witness this i cant say much cause that would spoil the movie if i did all im gonna say is that everyone is in a for a roller coaster of emotions and just plain epicness! You will be mindblown it's indescribable how good this movie is !!!!!",
        "Too many endings and too much focus on the showdown, but of course we enjoyed every second.",
        "Amazing avengers ... best so far\n\nSo funny and full of action and suspense ... loved it 100%",
        "After seeing endgame, I felt I had to let this out It probably the best movie to date (and I'm not hyping)...it got it all -action, suspense, comedy, emotional...just about everything a movie can possibly have...keep in mind it's a superhero movie but it exceed its limit...it also the best MCU movie in my book and it far exceed Infinity War. Maybe the most exciting and beautiful part of the movie came up about the last 40-30 minutes and it's the best thing I've ever see in Cinematic history.\n\nOverall, it a 10 out of 10 movie for me I don't really have to recommend you go see it before you do...just avoid spoilers before seeing it.",
        "Perhaps there are to many people that hate this movie, and other that love, personally, I love it, its beautiful, a gift for us, the last minutes I've smiled and cried. Obviously it's a good movie, but something is wrong, I dont know what it's but something is odd, and it taste strange, but everything have to end, right?",
        "I just want to say thank to Marvel for an epic 11 years and for an epic conclusion. Thank you Stan Lee, Kevin Feige, Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, RDJ, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, and all the other superheroes for this epic adventure! A job well done!",
        "Conflict of powerhouses. As good as Infinity Wars.",
        "A brilliant end to the Infinity Saga however I can't help but be put off by the amount of unsubtle product placement all throughout.",
        "This movie was soo epic. You're not ready for this movie and therefore the epic conclusion of more than 10 years. Tears will be shed, laughing will happen because this movie has everything. That's why it's a 10/10! See for yourself!",
        "My year movie until today\n\nLast scane was perfect and nice ending",
        "The film was moving, stunning, emotionally driven, and filled with deep meaningful stories, and authenticity throughout. RBDJ deserves an Oscar nom for this performance, as does the film and its leaders as a whole.\n\nThere were sniffles from beginning to end, laughs, claps, gasps, and a tangible optimism and heartfelt camaraderie in the theater.\n\nThis film was brilliant across the board.",
        "I would say Endgame is in the top 5 of all the MCU. It's cgi was brilliant and at times the story was beautiful. There are three things that I feel endgame didn't do well. Thor. Although ragnarok worked with the action comedy, I feel they went to far in endgame. It feels like they where almost mocking the character and at every turn you had no choice but to laugh at him. Thanos. How can thanos without the stones be so strong? I understood in Infinity wars his power but even with the stones he got crippled but storm breaker but suddenly in Endgame he's even stronger with Thor seemingly unable to use storm breaker in the same way. I feel the whole time travel although great to look back at 10+ years that brought us to endgame, there was no structure, it all felt messy. I love the MCU and I still rate the film. For me as this is my opinion, had they got these things right it would have been the best MCU film ever. Like I said had some beautiful moments within the story and that helps pull you through the movie.",
        "Without doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. I was completely gripped from the beginning. Fantastic performances by all of the cast (not that we'd expect any less), I find it hard to pick a favourite character because they're all so awesome, in this film more so than ever. I was on the edge of my seat throughout all of the action sequences, and have known few films to evoke such intense feelings of hope, and also great sadness/ loss. The humour throughout the film is spot on, and in one of the most important final scenes you could have heard a pin drop in the cinema, it was like everybody was holding their breath - staring at the screen in complete disbelief. As far as I can tell, no one saw that coming which is a credit to the writers and directors who were able to piece everything together so cleverly. It's an absolute masterpiece. Just one warning, though - if you're anything like me you'll need to go armed with tissues.",

        "Infinity war was amazing. Our favorite heros bar maybe hulk at their best. In this movie we see the efforts of Iron man, Captain America and Thor equate to far less than the capabilities of Captain Marvel. Her character comes across as arrogant and she makes our favorite heros look puny. Thor is made into a joke(again). And there is a very unsubtle shoving of a feminist ideology in this movie. Marvel would be nothing without characters like Scarlett witch, black widow, the ladies of Wakanda, Nebula, Gamora and so much more however, Captain Marvel quite literally makes the efforts of our favorite heroes seem pointless. Nothing on infinity war. Disappointed but not entirely surprised as Disney also butchered Star Wars when they got their hands on it.",
        "The best superheroe movie ever, every single moment is unexpected with an epic end",

        "With among the biggest anticipation for a film ever this film needed to deliver and it did just that.\n\nA comparatively slow start was great build up to a huge ending and an excellent ending to the saga.\n\nMassive shocks and big plot twists make this a film that's essential to see twice to take everything in I think. The acting and animation is about as good as it gets for now. Some great humour as well.\n\nI will be shocked if another film in 2019 tops this in the film charts and maybe, as sagas go, star wars is now knocked off its perch at the top.",
        "Robert Downey JR needs an Oscar. Fantastic performance",
        "Without revealing too much, I enjoyed the movie. Yes, three hours sounds like a lot, but I managed to do it without pausing for a bathroom break. Now that I think about it, this is the last time I'll sit through a three-hour movie. But enough about that.\n\nThe movie grabs you and won't let go until the end. The three hours pass pretty quickly and even though Stan Lee is no longer with us, I'm sure he got a proper send-off. I just don't remember where. But I'm glad he was a part of the MCU movie saga. All of the Avengers do battle with a powerful enemy. Who will survive? Who will not? All that will be revealed when you watch the movie. If you've been following the MCU closely, this will be the major climax.",

        "After 22 movies that slowly built up to this point, it was nicely executed, yes this one has some drama, some background on people's lives after the Thanos ordeal from the Infinity War, how people / characters changed etc etc. Has usual light heart witty jokes, the of course the Grand Finale, Watched on IMAX -3D and totally worth it. Got the tickets the first day they went on sale, Kids were counting days... Totally Worth it. Cant wait for it on Blu ray.",

I'm really surprised by how much considering this is just a block buster super hero movie. The thing is, I actually like movies. And I know they are entertainment. Are there holes in the time travel plot? Sure, but who cares. Just use your imagination to fill in the holes. Or don't think about it too much. It's not real life folks. I'm just grateful I live in the exact period of time where movies like this are possible. It's amazing what they can do. Imagine someone from the 1920's or 1820's saw this? Be grateful. This movie was a masterpiece. If you want less plot holes, watch a film, or read a book. This is a movie. And a damn good one.",

        "Watched it in 4DX. Premiere morning. This film makes me happy, sad, gives me peace and anger at the same time. It's a new caliber of superheroes movie. 3 hours means nothing.\n\nAs other marvel films, the sound, the effect and CGI is a top class. Story wise, yes we will find some minor loophole, and yes, it's argueable, but I can't think of any major plot hole that can makes me hates this film. Especially it's a film that conclude all previous films.\n\nIf you feeling happy, angry, sad or peace, believe me we are did.. and that's why this film is amazing and beautiful.

        "Avengers: Endgame is an abundantly gratifying finale that rewards long-lasting loyalty to the series. Endgame is visually magnificent, it looks stunning with phenomenal scale and is executed exquisitely. Emotionally invested, we feel grief, pain & struggle. This movie belongs to the originals. Tony, Steve, Bruce, Natasha, Thor and Clint. This is their story. A movie that will last for a very long time. I love you 3000.",

        "There is no other way that an amazing journey like Avengers could've wrapped up. The fire started with Iron Man in 2008 with some marvelous people including the one and only Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreau and ended with the epic piece directed by the Russo Brothers. As Tony Stark quoted, :\"part of the journey ended\" and left a legacy to being remembered by so many generations. The movie is definitely a masterpiece of this era which puts us on emotional rollercoaster, enjoy a flashback of the memory lane and a lot of kick-ass stunts. It tattooed our head and heart so deeply that we can never move on from this brilliant piece of jewel. One can only hope that marvel will lit the beacon again in the coming years to sustain this honorable legacy. My advice to all the people, Go watch it, even if you are not a fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe or \"superhero\" movies, you would find it once in a million worthy for spending your money and time both.",
        "I was a bit excited for this title given that I really like the previous one but I ended up a bit disappointed... It's often very versatile from one Marvel to another. I found the characters' decision not really making sense in many occasions and the plot ended up not making that much sense anymore I found.",
        "I mean i can't even talk about what just i saw there thank you Marvel.",

As someone who was never a fan of comics growing up, and only saw the first Iron Man movie as part of a work function, I have come to await every installment eagerly and this one most of all. It didn't disappoint and the non stop story made 3 hours feel like 1.5.",

Thank you stan , thank you Russo and thank you marvel for this beautiful film to look back on after I have kids and I show this to them and say , I lived a beautiful life.",

        "A story that Russo brothers started 10 years back came to an end.The fictional characters made sure they remain with us till last breath. Goodbye hurts no matter how beautiful it is and ofcourse not watching AVENGERS ASSEMBLE in future will even hurt more.Thats how impactful it was, even if you haven't watched any marvel movie watch them watch them all and witness the magic of how a 180+ minute movie binds you with emotions,actions and of course never ending love towards our superheros. Kudos.............",

I believe in most of the developments and paths the characters chose. For a movie with so many characters and converging plots, Endgame doesn't feel too packed.",
        "Not really expected that kinda of ending as it's superhero movie always gets good at end this doesn't; story and drama was good ; time traveling concept explained is confusing; little more action scenes was expected ; Already missing the lost heroes.",
        "Don't enter the theatre with preconceived notions of what you wanted them do do with this movie, no. Instead let it unfold as Infinity Wars did, an unexpected storm. This movie was epic, the acting, the cinematography, the story, the mixture and combinations of joy, pai, and suspense...all the years of a finally woven Marvel heroic tapestry. Finished. But in a way that leaves me yearning for more, but relishing the memories of the characters I once simply read about as a child from the 60s to seeing them in the big screen like never before. Man this was a great movie! A must see. Hollywood Oscar folks time to stop overlooking these cinematic treasures. There were some Oscar worthy performances in here. Phase was of the age of marvelous Marvel heroes hit it crescendo. And it was one for the ages!",
        "I LOVED every minute of Endgame. Thank you for such an amazing ride!",
        "I love The Avengers movies for what they are. I read comics & in my teens i was hooked on Hulk (still my fav) but what they did to Hulk in these movies is a disgrace. When Scarlett Witch got in Hulks head & then Ragnarok happened I was very hopeful for World Breaker Hulk but then we got Professor Hulk!? They ruined Hulk.. flat out ruined. & Drax is far more powerful than what these movies suggested.",
        "First off good movie but not spectacular. But infinity war was wayyyyyy better. Story line and build up made it really exciting. Now Endgame has its moments but almost an 1:30 of just a boring story line and average pace. People in the theater were not excited at all when I compare it to infinity war. We do have some funny and really touching parts. The last fight seen seemed rushed and not utilizing every character I felt was a flaw. You are ending this entire chapter of the last 10 years and most of the characters were barely used at all. I see why people like it and had the emotional connection because you are aware this is the last ride for many of them. But in my opinion infinity war has a much better story and build up that I actually left the theater really excited. When endgame finished. No one clapped and the atmosphere in the room felt like something was missing. If you are an mcu fan watch it. But don't have high expectations.",
        "It is truly the best movie ever.. I cried my eyes out.. I think we got attached to it in a way we couldn't imagine.. Great experience and a must.. Thanks marvel for this perfect masterpiece",

        "The film with the number of heros it shows looks like a show? Each want to say I am here in the film ! Nothing new ? It seems media played a lot in creating a mass positive thinking ! Long for 3 hours. A lot of talk that can be removed without affecting the film story? Its a kids film.",
        "First time you Watch it it's awesome, second time you watch it its good.",
        "What I saw is bunch of human warriors which each has special skill and ability and fight for what believed as right path. Superheroes don't joke, cry or get desperate. Superheroes don't reject any call for helps. Superheroes don't do silly things. They do. They are all human. A super kind human, with huge hearts. At the end that is what I get.\n\nBoth directors very well done bringing up a new thing, joining the heroic plot, whilst it is superhero movie we believed filled by tons of tough guys, and not anymore, every single one is vulnerable.\n\nThank you everyone, in producing this movie. It is a bad news for any superhero movies coming up next, though. Both from MCU or DCEU. One heavy standard has been stamped.",
        "Among few best you get to watch in a years .Avengers endgame is one of them.",

        "I'll start by saying that the last battle is the best battle in the whole Marvel universe. It starts like an hour before the movie ends. The first two hours has some boring parts, but they are relevant. It is a great movie, top 2-3",

        "Nice ending for a movie franchise. Great from beggining to the end.",
        "I can't believe how unbelievable these last 2 Avengers movies have been. They build upon the character's relationships and build upon the other movies! The only disappointment was I feel like the two movies seem very similar, (infinity war and endgame.) 9/10.",
        "This was an emotional roller coaster, extremely good. It had just the right amount of comedy, sadness, excitement, and everything in between to make you remember this movie forever. I would definitely recommend you to watch, although I have to say, what the hell were you all doing with your lives if you still didn't watch it yet.",
        "An interesting film and quite successful conclusion to the story with all the main and third-party hero lines involved to this point. But there are two minuses: soooooo boring and unnecessary stretching of dialogues and meaningful looks at each other which stretch the film even more... and a completely artificial looking drama where they tried to show it, especially with inappropriate jokes that are considered normal for Marvel's films in another situation, but at this drama they spoil it additionally. However, this does not spoil the overall impression of the film, which I was pleased with.",
        "The Russo Brothers prove themselves equal to their nigh insurmountable task in this expertly balanced centrepiece to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that both pays homage to the past eleven years of films and sends the universe in bold new directions. There is a weight of consequence to everything that happens but it never allows itself to become too morose or sombre without a sting of classic Marvel wit, and it harmonises this more grim tone with a level of glorious action hitherto undreamt of; bringing a number of intertwining story arcs we've followed and become invested in for years to the most satisfying of conclusions.",
        "After following the Marvel films for more than 10 years, it was a beautiful 'end'. The movie starts with a slow paced emotional tone and catches speed as the story goes on. Some of the goodbyes given to the main characters were heart touching while others were heartbreaking.",
        "Worst Marvel movie made. For those of you who gave it anything higher than a 3 are either knuckleheads or don't know anything about the Avengers. CGI was cool, only reason I gave a 3. All the hype of Cpt. Marvel and she is in the movie for 5 minutes. Worse than Infinity War, which also sucked. Movie made no sense.",
        "How you rate this other than a 10 is beyond me. I love infinity war and it's probably more #1 but this is a perfect film. I laughed,cried and cheered. The ending sets up the future movie's which I'm excited for. I'm assuming the black widow movie will be a origin story. Definitely worth watching!!!",

        "Best movie ever made. There is like 70 hero's. The movie does have its flaws like every movie. Robert downey jr.

        "Extremely well done. Wraps up all the character arcs with a bow on top. Numerous character crossovers from every MCU film. Similar to the series finale of Star trek the next generation in some ways.",
        "The movie is everything you want it to be and more. I was never bored in a single moment. The best part of the movie is watching them work and how they fit so much into a 3 hour movie which u would not want to miss a minute of. The movie opens with a subtle reference to infinity to spark ur memory of what happened at the end. The end made all 22 movies worth the watch and sets up the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe perfectly. You will happy, excited, and sad throughout the film. Without one of the best Marvel movies and best theater experience.",
        "This was obviously the best MCU film to date and im pretty sure everybody that saw this can agree. Without spoiling it there are some very sad moments but thats the most i can say. The whole story was great and it was just as good as any other great Marvel film. Even being a non-marvel kinda guy i actually liked the whole avengers series and i thought this was a good end to this 4 movie series. Watching these movies changed my mind about the whole MCU movies and i thought they were cool. Still not a huge fan but i enjoyed them for the most part. This movie is just a legend, enough said.",
        "A masterful epic that not only concludes the past 10 years, but also sets up the future of the MCU. Avengers Endgame delivered an outstanding and creative story while still adding meaningful conclusions and new beginning to our favorite characters. 9/10",

        "The best end for marvel studio movies, and best story and drama",
        "Where to begin? All the callbacks and tie-ins to past MCU films are truly a celebration of the MCU. As always, the action is exciting(Although sparse) and humour cracks you up. This movie reaches a new level going into the third act, with epic moments that put a grin on your face and an ending that might just put a tear in your eye. A must watch!",
        "I laughed so loud I clapped with so much force and I cried so hard the movie exceeds every expectation and is the perfect culmination of the entire marvel cinematic universe\n\nAvoid spoilers as all costs !",
        "I've just returned from watching Avengers: Endgame on opening night. As a fan of Marvel for over three decades I had many expectations and thoughts about what this movie might bring, and this movie was nothing that I expected. It brought us both the best (and worst in my opinion) versions of Earth's mightiest heroes. And I'm sure that many out there will disagree with me on which is which. What is undeniable is that the Russo's have managed to achieve what many (including myself) thought impossible, to deliver a film which pays tribute to the past decade's 21 (not including Endgame itself) Marvel Cinematic Universe offerings, whilst simultaneously closing out the story lines and creating an epic masterpiece in itself. It has humour (some of good), action, emotion and genuinely something for everyone all rolled up into an epic three hours of entertainment, which goes by in a flash. Well done, fantastic work.\n\nThanos, it's Hammertime!",

        "I know the hype around this movie, so I'm not going to give any plot points away. I will say, however, that it really is emotional, exciting, and awe-inspiring. I went in knowing very little (that's the way to go, by the way) and it really paid off, as a lot of the plot decisions were surprising and bold.\n\nIt has its problems, and without giving away too much, I thought that some feminist themes that were far too overt and frustrating were desperately forced in there. But in all, it's hard to complain about Endgame, because it really is one of the craziest things Hollywood has ever achieved.",
        "It's even better Than Last year Infinity War Age Of Ultron was ok and the first Avengers Movie Greet. Endgame was the Greatest Superhero In history",

        "It ain't perfect, no movie is, but Avengers Endgame is hitting on all cylinders from start to finish. It'll feel like one of those amusement park rides that once you get off you want to get back in line and ride it again and again.\n\nI guarantee you reviewers are using thesauruses to try and describe this movie and will fall short nonetheless.\n\nIt is epic in every sense of the word. Period.",
        "Avengers: Endgame was simply superhero perfection that was so worth all those Marvel movies. The storylines and action didn't disappoint at all that it had me at the edge of my seat every single second. Avengers: Endgame is not only a movie that Marvel fans should be proud of but it is one that Stan Lee would be damn proud of, no doubt. Simply amazing movie from Marvel.",

        "If you've seen the Marvel movies, this is their Thank You to all the fans. They didn't care much for the logic or story. They just wanted everyone to feel happy.\n\nAnd they did. I'm happy. Everyone in the cinema was clapping at the end credits.",
        "This film is very good, because the graphics in the style of the future and the action fits with a film of this size. I love this film, the best sci-fi movie.",
        "Something we've obviously not seen before, and not sure, even with Marvel, we'll ever quite see again.\n\nIt includes everything: development of already great Characters, spectacular action and incredible effects, humour, happiness, sadness - honestly, what more can you ask.\n\nReally don't know how they can possibly top this - up there with the very best of Action films, like Raiders.....",
        "I saw this movie the day it came out in my country (Israel) and I was amazed. I was happy, sad, excited, angry all at the same time in this movie, it has everything in it.\n\nAll our favorite Avengers are coming back and team up again after being broken down and hurt and it's so amazing to see that.\n\nYou won't regret seen this and of course in the movie theater!!!",

        "OMG... I haven't have had such an experience watching a movie as it took me down memory lane like crazy. I was laughing, crying, in a loop and was lucky to watch the movie without any spoilers...\n\nSo strongly urge everyone to not spoil the movie and let fans enjoy this amazing movie and culmination of last 11 years of marvellous MCU...\n\nPlease don't listen to negative reviews, as they might be either from hard core DCU fans who can't see Marvel success. ;) or people who just expect a Schindler list from Marvel, though it comes close to some of the most amazing and great drama movies of all time.\n\nNuff said, Fantastic movie...",
        "I am waiting for this movie from the day I watched Avengers Assemble movie in 2012... Perfect Ending.\n\nThere is no movie such grand in past or in recent times, not even star wars( sorry fans but its the fact). Marvel put every trick possible in this movie. I laughed, I got Thrilled and got Excited. Cried in the end and am happy while coming out of the cinema.\n\nThe makers tried their level best to portray such big story in 3hr time.... Even 3hrs are not enough to cover every detail, hence little flaws.",
        "Should only be watched to keep up with culture or whatever, pretty un-innovative. These movie makers are billionaires and this is what they produce? Wow.",

        "Have you director ever thing that you lie a billion peoples to belive that we can save half universal by \"time travel\"? What if the \"time travel\" is unable to make it real? So faith of Thanos was right, right? You make us belive in a false victory? Justice? Remember that a billion peoples watching and have faith in these hero. You make them lost and lie there win for Oscar. Look at our planet now! Thank you.",
        "This is one of the only movies I have ever seen on it's opening weekend, and, having seen all the other MCU films going in, I had ridiculously high hopes for it. This movie had to deal with millions of even bigger fans than me around the world, and it didn't disappoint. Everything you love about the MCU is present. The whole film managed to be surprising, endearing, and exciting at the same time. The cast has been doing this so long that they are excellent seemingly without trying, and several returning members provided a lovely surprise. The story unfolds in a direction no one expected (difficult considering the huge amount of theorists churning out alternates) and it manages to stay entertaining for three hours, a huge feat in itself, as well as upholding fan expectations. The script is funny and really!!! sad at the same. The cgi and visual effects are top notch as per with the rest of the movies. All in all, a fantastic, unforgettable movie that leaves an impact on the MCU. It's going to be hard to top this come the next Avengers movie.",
        "The time travel plot is nonsensical, Thor and Hulk are complete jokes thanks for an attempt at bad comedy, Thanos is 2-dimensional, and also the anticlimactic CGi mess that is the final battle. Ignore every 8 to 10 star bots.",
        "Endgame, the last movie in the Infinity saga. Set's up an amazing final showdown with the purple brute himself.\n\nIt also wraps up the story lines of multiple veteran characters very will. This movie aims to please. Every fan will be satisfied.",
        "This movie was an excellent film that fulfills expectations and maintains a serious tone but doesn't fail to make you laugh. In the audience there are audible cheers as each character is revealed and tears among all audience members as the sad inevitably happens. The bad reviews often overlook the culture and environment this film gives easy 20/10",
        "I really love iron man,but the ending made me so sad an upset.He is heart even though he is just a person.I love him 3000.",
        "I was seriously in awe the entire time! Definitely worth the wait and the length! Every marvel fan will be proud of this movie through and through! I can't fathom how amazing this movie is! No doubt the greatest movie marvel has made.",
        "So slow at times, probably not worth the effort. It's over at least",
        "This was a good movie. Loved it!!!! Loved the ending too!!!!!!",
        "Avengers:Endgame,wasted all Avengers Series. Very Poor story, pathetic twists, lots of ridiculous jokes and minimum action. Hulk character is wasted Arrogant Captain Marvel. Waste of money I dont recommend to see in Cinemas",
        "Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.",
        "It could definitely be improved, but every possible flaw can be totally overlooked because of the 22 film build-up, it seems earned completely for every joke that doesn't land (which isn't many) there are a hundred fan-service moments that make you forget any wrongdoing Following up such an airtight film like Infinity War would be superbly difficult, making the 11 years feel worth it is an achievement and The Russo Brothers deserve praise.",
        "Endgame is the pinnacle of what is possible for the comic book genre, the 10 year infinity saga comes to a emotionally satisfying end. And is easily one of the greatest films of all time, it's an experience you will never forget and a film that will never be forgotten.",
        "One of the best comic movie ever made after infinity war.Lots of emotions.Epic",
        "Fitting end to the Avengers in an entertaining span of 23 movies. Phase 4 is the new hope of the New Avengers.",
        "Man.. that was absolutely amazing.. well done.. i'm speechless, best movies ever..",
        "Infinity War and Endgame are fantastic back to back, they perfectly blend with each other and it is a 2 part story told perfectly. Hawkeye in this film is amazing, he knows he has done wrong and wants to sacrifice himself. Tony and Peter's relationship is great aswell. But the best friendship in this movie is between Tony and Steve, the two share the most screen time and it is the finale to both of their stories. The 2nd last film in the MCU so far, is the best.",
        "Overall, I'm very satisfied with this movie. It was incredibly ambitious, taking risks that I didn't think it could possibly take. It was also obviously emotional being that this is a goodbye to some characters and a huge story line that has been set up since 2008. This movie also has the most epic final battle that I've seen in any movie, and anybody who sits through that wont be disappointed.\n\nWith that being said, this movie definitely has some pacing problems. There were some moments that kind of lagged. And while this movie takes some risks, not all of them pay off. To be honest, some of the risks this movie took with the plot kind of left me a little confused., but the good out ways the bad and we've gotten a very satisfying conclusion to an incredible group of movies.",
        "One of the best movies ever made! Everything was great!",
        "To put it simply: One of THE most overrated films ever made.... I wanted it to be everything i'd hoped for, i wanted it to live up to the gargantuan hype, but unfortunately it falls short and in essence 'fails nonetheless' (to quote Thanos) The final fight was good, but again nothing more I do not wish to include spoilers so i'll say this: This was not EPIC Some people thought so\n\nBut not us #DontspoiltheEndgame",
        "Because the actor is very deep into his role in the film.",
        "World best movies and my favourite My experience awesome",
        "Avengers is the best movie ever. Avengers: Endgame is a cinematic event that must be witnessed on the big screen, marking the end of an era for Marvel but one that still exceeds expectations with fantastic writing, emotional value, nostalgia, and visuals and set pieces that will be remembered for the rest of however long superhero and action movies continue to be made. Thank you, Marvel Studios, for making such a sensational universe and making the experience of being a fan an unforgettable one.",
        "Endgame was definitely better than infinity war. Luckily they did not make the mistake of staring all marvel heroes on every planet and in space (or at least not for the main part). This film was literally about cleaning up the huge mess infinity war left behind. Better, but far from the great first 2 parts of this series. A very slow pace, overly long, far fetched story full of plot holes. Some nice elements though like the \"back to the future\" part. And as expected there was the obligatory tear jerking part at the end.",
        "Too much CGI, forced jokes and not so interesting characters, typical of Marvel.",
        "After Infinity War I was worried about how Endgame would take the second half after the snap and I loved it. It was happy, it was sad, I laughed and I cried and I felt the characters and their stories went exactly where they needed to to. Bravo, Marvel!!",
        "Not as good as Infinity War, but still a very satisfying conclusion to a lengthy, beloved franchise. Lots of great laughs and awesome moments.",
        "Overall average movie still infinity war is the best..they ruined some of the mcu characters such as Thor and Hulk. In the last 21 films we knows that how strong is thor bt in the endgame thor was a in a comic role only they ruined the character.emotional weight of the story is rly praise worthy cinematography and visuals are marvelous.like the matter of thor plenty of mistakes is there in the film. Overall average film",
        "Marvel did an amazing job, nothing could be better in the next phase.",
        "For 11 years marvel has been building up for their epic finale and it is almost safe to say they nailed it With an emotional roller-coaster, breathtaking soundtracks and epic scenes and fight sequences that will be the standard against which all the upcoming movies of this genre is held, Marvel delivered the superhero movie of the decade However, the plot felt a little forced as they were constantly trying to provide the perfect finale - which they almost did -, they filled the movie with plot drivers to reach the epic peak of Marvel cinematic universe But all in all I can safely say that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen and it can probably withstand the test of time as people at different times can sit at the edges of their seats as they see the \"AVENGERS ASSEMBLE\".",
        "Absolutely speecheless. Magnificant. Go watch now!",
        "Possibly one of the few superhero movies to invoke so much emotion from beginning till its rolls it curtains, literally. People cheered even louder when the main Avenger's name came out in the credit scene.\n\nIf watching the movie on your own is an 8/10, watching it at the cinema on its premiere is a definite 11/10.\n\nIt's a moment I won't forget. Thank you Russo brothers, writers, actors/actresses and all for making this possible. Thank you.",
        "Without the credits. The movie is 2 hours and 40 mins. The movie is boring at the start. It has a slow build up. It gets good..",
        "Ignoring the girl power escene, the movie is perfect. Avenger Assemble!",
        "After watching Avengers Endgame twice I can honestly say that it is the BEST marvel film to date. Without giving anything away, which is very hard, this movie is very emotional and intense. I have been a fan of this franchise since the beginning and this is the best ending they could've came up with. The way this movie plays out is not how I would've expected and I love that. It truly is Marvel's victory lap. While it is long it is very worth it. There has never been a movie like it before, with 21 films worth of build up, and there will most likely never be a movie like this again. As I said I've seen it twice and plan to go as many times as I can. It is a one of a kind experience. AND for the love of god don't spoil it for other people or yourself!!!! The best way to watch this movie with a clear mind. Free of any spoilers. If you do this, you are in for a real treat!",
        "What an end to an epic series. A roller coaster of action, humour and emotions.",
        "Marvel have done such a great job at creating a broad storyline, that pieces together like a puzzle. This truly is a Marvel fans fandream movie. It does sag a bit in the middle. Some characters are a little underwhelming, Thors storyline was dull. I did feel like there was more invested interest in Captain America, because the Russo brothers have already built that character up so much.\n\nBut that last battle was amazing. It reminded me of the feeling I got when I first saw the final act of the Attack of the Clones, truly awesome!",
        "Slow and ponderous with little or no character development or display of the talents they are supposed to have until the end of the film. The plot or storyline is simple and dull. I fell asleep in the film and my only regret is that I woke up and then had to watch the rest of the film, boring and predictable and will not engage you if you have a mental age of over about 16 or under",
        "Spectacular, Emotional, Joyful, Unexpected, Filled with Actions.. Avengers Endgame is lifetime achievement.. It's the conclusion of 22 films.. It's like end of an era.. So please watch it in Imax or 3D and don't spoil the movie.. You'll enjoy it very much.. The ending is very satisfying..",
        "This movie was the end of 22 movies... Supposed to be the most intense movie of all time. Yet infinity war had way more emotion and way better script. I even think that age of ultron was better. All they focused on was linking all the 22 movies into one and fan service. I feel for that reason it wasn't as impactful as infinity war. The way they end the characters stories was ok, i would have done it differently and done something that would make your heart drop, like they did in the first 5 min of the movie. And also they did something to a certain character and all i can say is WHY, SO STUPID. 7 may seem like a descent rating but i am very disappointed because this movie had unlimited potential and now i'll never get to see the endgame i wanted to.",
        "Of course, Comedy with Fantasy and Action. The heroes are like your uncles and aunts, fun to watch but not what pumps your senses for the thrill. You'll feel all the time like it's meh, because they want to make all audiences enjoy the movie. Doing that the movie becomes average. So the characters are all good hearted and full of feelings, nothing like a hero who has True Will. I'm glad that at least this last movie didn't come with ideological references, it was just this polictical correctness that numbs us as society. Everyone is a good boy there. Anyway, the public that Marvel seeks now is not me. No problem, since I noticed it, I'll just ignore future movies from them. Leave a thumbs up if now you also agree it's a comedy movie not an action thriller movie, so other people can see this too.",
        "I just watched Endgames, three hours are over; Tired, completely dehydrated after crying so much. And we instinctively held each other in hand at some point along the way, with my side fields",
        "This movie hit all the notes, was well acted, entertaining, emotional and wrapped everything up nicely. Yea the time travel aspect is hokey but ITS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE PEOPLE! Don't believe the hate, do believe the hype and go see this movie!",
        "This is an edit on my first review where I talked about how I loved it more on my second viewing than my first, but over time I now think more about how my Dad took me to see the star wars movies and the Indiana Jones movies and how that was my childhood. I took my kids and I hope that when they grow up the avengers theme is what the star wars theme was for me!\n\nMy Dad has passed away and my regret is I couldn't show him what he showed me.\n\nI can take heart though knowing that I've now replaced my Dad in the scenario and hopefully passing on the same memories with my kids.\n\nTake your Dad man, you'll be forever grateful.",
        "Avengers Endgame is the best by far. All Marvels Cinematic Universe movies come together beautifully.",
        "Even though I was able to predict the plot, this film was absolutely amazing. Incredible action, tear jerking & the perfect end to the Infinity Stone Arc. Only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was because 1 character I can't stand. Luckily they weren't in it much.",
        "Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, Avengers: Endgame does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga",
        "There is a lot more right with this movie then wrong. Marvel fans will love it. It is too long by about 35 minutes and focuses mostly on the original six Avengers (who after 20 Marvel films are no longer the most exciting of the line up). The battle scenes are amazing but also happen so fast it will all be a blur. (It's meant to be watched more then a few times.) The plot is confusing and Brie Larson (Captain Marvel) is barely in it. (A big over sight as her film was a major box office hit.) Unless you are a fan (and who isn't) you'll want to take a hard pass on this one. Do not watch it in 3D!! The glasses just darken an already gloomy screen image. Not worth it. Otherwise, it's a fun popcorn movie with enough emotional highs and lows to merit the hype surrounding it. Might be best to see it in IMAX or at the drive in.",
        "That fat Thor is amazing. But I think Captain America can lift the Hammer becouse Thor oermited that.",
        "Endgame was basically the perfect end to years worth of movies. Great scenes that gave goosebumps, funny scenes that gave laughs and the Thor, Cap vs Thanks fight was worth admission prices Alone",
        "This is Marvel's most epic film, and possibly the whole history of cinema. Dramatic, profound, with comedy, TOO EMOTIONAL, and a great final worthy and good closing for our heroes. The last minutes are an ode, ALL THE PEOPLE APPLAUDED and then the room completely silent with a lump in the throat, the tears came out and ran down my cheeks.\n\nThe bar is very high for the future of cinema. I do not have the slightest doubt that it will be the highest grossing film in history, unseating Titanic, Star Wars Ep. 7 and Avatar. (Until the Lion King arrives)",
        "Absolute greatness done by marvel Everything about it is amazing",
        "Absolutely heart breaking from beginning to end. I'm not going to sit here and spoil the movie for anyone, but if you love Marvel movies you'll love this.",
        "Good but this has the most problems out of any phase 3 marvel film. Time travel is cheesy, none of the acting was EXCEPTIONAL except for RBJ. They didn't know what to do with Thor or hulk but they didn't really focus on them too much so its fine. Captain Marvels character is terrible. None of the time travel stuff makes sense and they keep breaking rules. Why is CA on the bench I thought it created an alternate timeline. When nebula was caught why didn't she GET OUT OF THERE. Your particles still work LEAVE. Why can't Captain Marvel snap the gauntlet, she's the strongest avenger. Anyway it was still good, it's kinda just pros vs cons but it was fun (except for the first two acts).",
        "Avengers - Endgame offers a stunning and moving ending. The best I could've expected. Many people cried... Thank you Marvel for this experience, I don't know If it'll ever happen again.",
        "It has everything you need. The perfect ending.\n\nIt's now one of my most favorite movies.\n\nBeautiful special effects, a very interesting story with very good acting by all the actors.\n\nThe only negative is who will be the next Captain America and I am sure Brothers Rousso could with their talent could change the ending and make it even cooler.",
        "Wow. Wow. Wow. From beginning to end, I couldn't think of a better ending to one of the greatest sagas of our lifetime! The writing was perfect and well paced. You had your expected comedy from a Marvel Studios film, but man when it took a turn, you were in for the ride of your life. I laughed, I gasped, and yes, I cried...a few times. Real tears. So emotional. I'm not sure any range of films could have or ever will culminate in anything close to this. Kudos to the actors who we took this ride with over the last 10+ years and of course to the Russos.",
        "Avengers Endgame is a perfect farewell packed with emotions and grandeur, Must watch for Marvel Fans...",
        "Paltrow and Downey are the two most insipid actors on the planet. No matter the role they play it the same. Banal. Wooden. Worthless. Arrogant. Boring. I can only imagine how much better the films they disgraced would have been with real talent.",
        "Too many jokes which make the movie very long to watch, but the end is totally worth it! Nice way to end those beautiful movies!",
        "The movie is fine but is very overrated. The first 2 hours are so slow and boring to be honest. This movie only amazed marvel fan's. The 8 out of 10 is more than deserved.",
        "Once is not enough to watch this movie. It blew me away.",
        "Believe me, in 3 hours I didn't blink my eye. There are few visual glitches despite story telling, direction and everything that give you full 3000 times satisfaction.",
        "I will not call it a fitting ending.. but it was definitely beautiful. The movie ensures that every character is given enough space, but not too much. The ending battle is epic! But what stole my heart was the credits. It's a must watch for the franchisee fans.",
        "The star rating doesn't go to 11 and this film deserves it. Ties everything together beautifully. Great acting and a great story. 3 hours zipped by. If marvel movies are your thing you won't be disappointed.",
        "It has been, a little under eleven years since I saw the first iron man movie with my dad in the movie theater, at the time none of us really could imagine what was in store for us. the infinity saga is one of the most complex stories I have ever seen strung together within the cinematic universe. Endgame has everything I could have asked for, humor, plot twists, world-class acting, life lessons, heartbreak, and most importantly closure, and although not all of them are great, I am certain that I one day will make my kids watch the entire saga in the hopes that they will find them as special as we did.\n\nTo The Russo brothers, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee, and all the other geniuses behind this amazing adventure, Thank you for telling us your story.",
        "Lets be honest... Avengers Infinity War was 1000x better than Endgame.",
        "I have waited this movie for a year, and it doesn't let me down. Looking forward to the next 10 years!",
        "Loved it! Made me tear up many, many times. The cast did amazing!",
        "Objectively it's a decent movie. But as someone who was simply BLOWN away by Infinity War. This movie just left me plain confused. There are so many giant plot holes. The script seems rushed. Not well planned out. And maybe the term \"snooze fest\" is a bit harsh. But the movie builds up really slow. Only to reach a point that is very predictable. For me, just too bad for it's potential.",
        "Just go watch it! It is worthy! Captain America, Thor, Everyone!!! And Tony.. omg.. \ud83d\ude03 best movie made by Marvel!",
        "Endgame was a great way to end an amazing 11 years. I loved every second of it. Usually I'll disagree with some moments, but in this one, I loved every single second.",
        "This was one of the best Marvel films ever, it was a great watch, and as someone who has complete invested into the MCU, I can say that this was a greta finish to a great film series.",
        "In many of the battles in the MCU movie, End Game is the most thrilling.",
        "What a way for Phase 3 to end. Its crazy that you have waited so long for the movie that you have waited for all your life.",
        "Redundant plot, unnecessary long, unexplainable events and meaningless humour!",
        "I'm going to see this movie ina couple of hours. And while no one has spoiled this movie for me yet, I don't know why they are airing so many spoilers in TV spots? First the trailer shows Tony stuck in space, and now the TV spot shows Tony with the other Avengers in those white stormtrooper like suits. It tells us Tony survived Space. Also they put out the trailer for the next Spider-Man movie so we know he comes back (as expected).\n\nSo knowing all this I'm gonna go watch this in IMAX 3D, and I'll add my review to this post once seen.",
        "The first part was much better. This one feels like a letdown!",
        "Nothing to say more than that this movie will always be the greatest of all time.",
        "Finally we got a worthy ending to the dc universe heroes with this 22nd and final film in the saga. 3 hours of entertainment which will leave u wanting more. although not as great as part 3 was still this is worth of your time as u get entertained often with lots of laughs and a lots of flashbacks as we get to see the past many times as that was the plot in this movie. this is one of the worthy dc films as we got a ton of those in last decade due to high $$$ earnings and not all of them were good. at least the last two avengers movies were great. now I hope we get a big break from those movies until they figure out what they will bring next. thank you marvel for a wonderful journey all those past years.\n\nGrade // B+",
        "Well, they definitely threw everything into this movie including the kitchen sink. And they worked hard to give all of the characters sufficient screen time. I definitely feel as though I got my money's worth. There wasn't a boring moment in the movie and it didn't feel like a 3 hour movie. There's lots of action and lots of laughs. However, less would have been more. Or maybe it's that I am not used to seeing a movie in a crowded theater.",
        "There is a lot of spam 1 star ratings on here. Not sure why. Perfect ending to a great storyline. It had a bit of everything but tied the MCU up in a nice bow. Not without it's crazy plot twists. Sit back, relax, and enjoy!",
        "I'm so disappointed in this film as it was the End! I waited months, maybe even a year for this to come out. I didn't watch any trailers or listen to any critics because I wanted this experience to be epic. It was boring, dull, flat and uninspiring. The messed with a few characters and in my opinion, ruined them. The fight scenes weren't the best and it did smack of SJW at times. Captain Marvel played a very small role in this, which I'm glad about, and somehow still managed to look like the hero. I'm a huge fan of the MCU which is why I'm extra disappointed. I can't figure out why this has such a high rating...or can't i \ud83e\udd14",
        "Pretty to look at kinda boring . A lot going on chi is good visually appealing but other than that a bit long winded for me . Glad it is over .",
        "Before this my all time favourite movie was Gladiator. But this one topped that . I have seen all Marvel movies more than one time. And the conclusion to all those movies is perfect. Ppl who don't like the story or the pace of the movie do not get what they tried to achieve over 22 movies. I can't see anything wrong with the movie. Things that bothered some ppl didn't bother me at all. This was the end of an era do ppl rlly want that fitted in a 2 hour movie NOoooo! Dont be a baby over the 3 hour sit. It is so worth it! If u can't see that than don't bother writing a review. I can accept bad reviews if they are thought trough. Everybody has their own taste but don't hate just to hate. I wrote this cause ppl that like movies don't leave reviews as often as ppl who don't like it. So go watch this movie and enjoy every second of it ;-)",
        "Thanks for with me in my best 11 years. I love you 3000 times. Simply the one best thing to live in Earth as Human.",
        "This Movie is better than Infinity War, Cap and Thor are so funny, is a love letter to the Original Six Avengers, has callbacks and payoffs to the previous MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) Films and has The Most Satisfying Ending to the 11 year Infinity Saga",
        "One sound,and half of all life in the universe goes up in smoke. Super heroes rise and fall for what they believe in. Endings are part of the process,thank you for having such a happy, unforgettable and eternal journey in these ten years of my life.",
        "Amazing, 100% the best MCU movie by a country mile. Everything you want plus 1,000,000 extra amazing bits",
        "This film was the climax of the entire infinity saga, and it did not disappoint. One of the best films I have ever seen. And trust I've seen some really good films.",
        "Terrible long winded mess. Thor goes from ragnarok funny to unbelievably forced... same as the rest of the films jokes... forced. It really is bad. Marvel's lost the plot. Corny, politically correct, gender neutral pleasing tat. Stan Lee would be embarrassed.",
        "Long movie. It was good but not great unless your under 25",
        "I don't have any words for this movie just awesome. I think if this movie was 20 min shorter it would surpass 3 billion mark at the box ofiice and guess what is the only movie that I think deserves that. A perfect ending for a perfect start.",
        "Greatest superhero movie ever and a emotional dose first time in superhero movie amazing adventures and love u 3000",
        "Infinity War was batter.So we expected something better from it",
        "What can I say, Epic, emotional, shocks and twists.... No one is prepared for this. The movie felt like 1.5 hours even though was 3 and could have gone for another hour and still flown by. You will need to watch multiple times as a lot happens that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and to process everything that goes on. The ending credits are different to pay homage to the cast and to signal end of an arc spanning 11 years. This movie deserves to knock avatar off the highest grossing movie of all time. From Aus to U.S you are in for a wild ride once opens..",
        "Great movie ! So much in the end and the flashbacks made it all make sense. All 22 movies and they end with this. Great movie",
        "Okay I'm waited a long time to watch the movie and I've got to say I'm pretty disappointed first they made two of the biggest stars into jokes thor is a fat sloppy drunk and hulk is a big green Sissy I don't even think Hulk threw a punch everyone wanted to see all the heroes come back and they did but they lost one of the greats at the end could have been so much better",
        "This is the best unexpected movie you're gonna see,whatever theories you think you have throw that in garbage disposer because nothing and absolutely nothing can make you ready for this",
        "This is without a doubt the very best movie I have ever seen in my entire life and the most unexpected,most emotional movie,the events,the characters,......wow",
        "Let's start with this, the plot has little flaws or plot holes here and there. And if you didn't watch a whole lot of other previous MCU films. Maybe this is not for you.\n\nFor me, who watched every MCU movies ever produced. This one has it all. A new take on hero movie, part of it like mission impossible. Very well thought out story. A hidden layer of means. Take its time to resolve many things, not rushing it.\n\nIf Ironman I is a 10, this one is a 11.",
        "I have seen this couple of time but still I can watch over and over again.",
        "This is a amazing movie which is easy to track the story point and the charters the only fault i can give is the story line its has can get quite confusing other then that amazing story non the less and a good sequence of fight scenes and other emotional scene.",
        "My spoiler free review of Avengers Endgame:\n\nThe best MCU movie. The theatre I was in went totally nuts. It had spectacular action, it was surprisingly funny, and emotionally captivating. It manages a large roster of well developed characters which are very well executed, everyone gets a moment to shine. Delightful throwbacks to previous outings as well as smartly placed pop culture references. A truly satisfying finale for the 22movie and 11 year story arc which we have come to love.",
        "Pride of MARVEL ... thanks you Russo brothers for such great MCU ending, brilliant events and twist",
        "More is not always better and a lot more is definitely mind-bogglingly hard to wrap one's senses around. After a slow build that effuses with emotional and relational devastation the movie thae turns towards a building resolution with multiple scenes of bravery and sometimes sacrifice. With so many super characters and subplots, its pretty difficult to really absorb the more intimate prolonged exposure that most dramatic movies offer. There are numerous attempts of pushing the audience's emotional buttons that abound in this superhero finale and in that effort there are a number of typical and well-execute ploys by scriptwriters to milk the scenes for all their worth. This grab bag of personas and dramatic and comedic turmoil all come together in a pretty full package that at times bulges at the seams. This is a movie that tries really hard to encompass the full panoply of the Marvel Universe which is likely too big for just one or perhaps two full length films to capture comprehensively or adequately. But nice, if impossible try.",
        "Great closure, amazing movie. Just the right ending for a 22 movie saga.",
        "It Felt too long and overhyped. It contained a lot of plot holes. Only reason I'm not giving one star is the portal scene at the end.",
        "I have been with Marvel for the past decade and have loved their movies. After watching Infinity War, I was devastated. End Game is even better than that film in every way. I won't spoil the movie for you but I can assure you that you are going to love every single moment of this film. There are so many epic moments that you are going to witness. You will laugh and cry every now and then. It is a wild ride from beginning to end. It reminded me why I love movies. Just go and watch it on the biggest IMAX screen possible, if you can get the tickets.",
        "Not enough action Not enough Spider-Man\n\nWell not enough word for making a review",
        "Lucky to have watched it in the very first preview, not going to be spoiling things, but people you are witnessing a conclusion of 22 Movies, you can't be fair enough while Judging, unless you have seen the efforts of 10 years of Experience in making best stories to best movies, believe that or not, if you saw the rest movies and have an idea of what every character represents you will deeply appreciate that movie, and easily say it worth 15/10, so many sacrifices, so many happiness, joy and laughter, best cinema experience among all competitors, finally gotta say, MCU rocks all the way, after a low hit in Captain Marvel, they hit back in a way to blow your mind Planet Earth, enjoy the peace of art",
        "Never Thought a day like This would Come.. When i Recall Those nostalgic memories .. Thanks For This Era Im Lucky i got to live in it. Avengers Forever",
        "After Dark Knight, this is the best superhero movie. Immaculate justice to the 21 films.",
        "Well, what can I say? I am extremely lost for words. I won't spoil the plot, but all I can say is go see this film!!! It's going to be hard to say goodbye to the actors that played the iconic original six Avengers characters. You would defiantly feel bittersweet while watching the film. I laughed, I cried, I gasped! I felt the same emotions when I watched Infinity War!!\n\nGO SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!",
        "This is everything I needed from Endgame.a Lot of people who only watched it for the hype won't be able to enjoy the movie as much as we Marvel do. It gave the characters the ending they deserved and oh my God that last fight scene is a freaking masterpiece. I don't think any movie will ever make me feel the way I felt while watching Endgame in a decade.",
        "This was a cool and fun film... but it did not meet expectations being that this was the grand finale we've all been waiting for... it had its epic moments and I laughed.. a lot.. but I just expected more.. especially after being blown away by Infinity War... this film was kinda a let down for me.. like most reviews already stated... they went a little to far with the humor. Some of the characters were just not the hero's we know and love... after all this waiting around for the biggest battle in MCU history.. it was short and not that exciting... I'm a huge Marvel fan... and as a fan.. for me at least... Marvels big finale was disappointing.... but, I gave it a 7 being that it was fun, seeing all the hero's on the big screen like that was great and it had its moments... but still a let down.. Thanks for reading.",
        "The best Marvel movie so far! Perfection at its best!",
        "The Avengers: Endgame...a true comic book masterpiece! You can't get any better than this, a perfect finale to The Avengers series.",
        "Each and every character of this movie has given their contributions to the fullest that makes this movie fantastic. The credits of end game has been given to each and every characters who have been the part of the jounrey with their tireless efforts and hardwork. The screenplay of the movie is the most attracted part that enabled audience driven to this movie . This movie consists emotions that made us cry, laugh and given a wonderful experience to all the cinema lovers. Each and every dialogues made us cry and laugh that was the huge part of the movie driven the End game to success. There could be an end to the marvel universe but there is no end to love of the millions and billions of fans of marvel universe . Thank you marvel \ud83d\udcaa",
        "This movie was incredible I did like avengers infinity I thought no over marvel film would top it but some how avengers end game has beat marvel movie ever and one of the best of all time.",
        "Of all the movies I think about being the most most memorable, I think of It (2017) and Endgame, but probably Endgame because I actually went to theaters for Endgame. I'll talk about It in another review. Endgame is the most memorable because it was literally the only thing all my peers at school would talk about for like a half a year. It was probably longer for 6th graders because they were even more crazy about it from what I heard. It also is the most memorable because it was so long and it is the epic conclusion of like 22 marvel movies. Oh yeah, you also can't forget this movie because of Thanos epic quote \"I am inevitable\" I want to actually write a review about this but this movie is just too complicated to talk about in one review it would take forever (not saying this movie is confusing. It made perfect sense) So let me just say this is the best Marvel movie so far, but not the best movie ever made. I wish it would just be the end because it would be the best time to end it because it was so epic, but you know Disney want that money so we got to make more.",
        "I seen this in the theaters and let me tell you this was the most mixed emotion movie ever this movie had me crying especially at the end and there were some parts that were heart raceing and another part were it was funny so all around i supper recommend to watch this movie it will have you in love it has alot of action",
        "This film was done so well. The 3rd act I will say in my lifetime will never happen again. This movie brings all the feelings inside to life 10 fold. I love this movie",
        "Great storytelling great effects very funny movie with great villain",
        "The movie was great with the best ending I could ask for in a superhero movie (that I predicted BTW) and the action was on point!",
        "Specially like scarlett johansson acting in this endgame. Can feel her sadness and helpness.",
        "Maybe my expectations were too high but in the end this move was just OK. It isn't bad - and it is a must see if you are invested in the Marvel Universe - but it isn't great. Maybe it gets lost in trying to include too many characters or maybe is Disney trying to be PC and intentionally make it try to appeal to too many people but in the end it made it less interesting. It has its crowd cheering moments and is epic - but when the big spoilers happen I almost didn't care. Hopefully Marvel can reboot with the X-men and Fantastic 4 because the current group has run its course.",
        "This film is incredible!!! I do dislike Captain Marvel, here character is ridiculously over-powered to the point she makes the GOD of thunder look weak. However, she is barely in the film and I'm glad it focuses the OG avengers high-lighting their personal sacrifice and struggle in the fight against tyranny. This film effectively ties some loose ends with an impressive attention to detail but still leaves space for the Marvel universe to continue to grow and continue to brighten our lives. You could only dislike this film if you have no investment in the previous 21.",
        "I appreciate many desperate people want to seem \"edgy\" or \"alternative\" by defining themselves as \"different\" but really, you come off as nothing more than the representation of inadequacy. I'm not suggesting you need to love this movie or that you can't find fault, but what this and it's predecessor, Infinity War, achieved; not only in cinema, but storytelling as a whole, is laudable. This is not a stand-alone movie and requires some foreknowledge, but it's an accomplished endgame of a movie arc of over 10 years unlike any other in movie history",
        "Stop reading the reviews & go watch it in theaters..... Its worth it",
        "The only way to explain this movie is \"Cognitive Dissonance\". Its foundations are fundamentally cracked with the best plaster covering it.\n\nThe Good? Most of the Characters are given satisfactory closure and/or sequel-fuel, in particular Tony, Cap, Thor and GOTG. The Visuals are amazing and breathtaking. Actions Scenes have large pay-offs for series veterans. Highly emotional and atmospheric.\n\nThe Bad? The film introduces too many plot threads, then it is attempting to close pre-existing ones. Some of the humour doesn't work. Thanos lacks the development that IW gave him.\n\nThe Ugly? The main plot gimmick is non-nonsensical. Thor is just awful.",
        "A masterclass to culminate 21 movies. If you are a fan of the MCU, appreciate all it has to offer, and are open to what comes around the corner, then this movie delivers on all front. Multiple viewings necessary in order to fully grasp to shear monstrosity that is a Endgame. You will laugh, cheer, shake with adrenaline, and cry. Thank you Marvel and the Russo brothers, this was fun.",
        "Less action, too many drama, and not all heroes in super hero modes, no twisted ending .. little boring.",
        "This is one over hyped movie that under delivers. Marvel really is comedy and lacks the darker tone of the DC universe. Some people like the light Marvel universe but it's really lost something along the way. You need to throw common sense out the window with the this one and Captain Marvel, wtf haha. Enjoy.",
        "The Infinity Gauntlet trilogy was one of my most cherished comic books growing up. I would have never imagined it would become a movie one day. With each movie after the original Iron Man that truly started shaping the MCU, it was clear Marvel was taking the direction of adapting my beloved comic to the big screen. I was very apprehensive but they surpassed everything I could dream of. After some 30 MCU movies, they got the formula down to a science with the right amounts of action, funny, epic, touching and overall awesomeness to please most people and the result is a memorable experience that is a perfect conclusion of this generation of MCU. Bravo, and from that little kid who didn't have much besides comics growing up: thank you!",
        "The Best MCU film ever made. The 22nd movie of Marvel Cinemastic Universe have done loyality for all the anticipation of marvel fans. Every marvel fan will be heartbroken after seeing the movie. It is a must watch",
        "Not much to say Awsome movie time flew while watching it. Rollercoaster ride of emotions. Well done.",
        "After the disaster that was Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame was a pleasant surprise. It's recommended for fans of comic book films.",
        "I cried, i cheered, i laughed, i screamed. I was utterly absorbed by this three hour epic conclusion, by all it's characters and their relationships beetween one another. Groundbreaking.",
        "Endgame is the best Marvel movie ever, that simple. Very funny, very emocional. Awesome soundtrack. And the last 50 minutes....OMG.",
        "It is any movie you could ever ask for. It makes you smile, it makes you cry, and it makes you laugh. It blows your mind and is completely unpredictable. It's all you could ever ask for in a movie. It is the greatest end to a franchise and will be remembered forever.",
        "The complexity and dozens of meaningless characters thrown in to the sequel was unnecessary and a mess to keep up with. In this conclusion we see our favourite main characters again and some slight twists with a decent ending. The CGI and acting great as usual, however some of the scenes are irritating in their convenience. I.e. captain America taking too much of the spotlight considering his powers.",
        "Endgame will and always be my favourite superhero movie they way the put an end to certain characters is so emotional \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dsteve finally got to live his life that he always wanted, tony got to say a goodbye to his father and much\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d.",
        "I have more questions then answers. The ending felt rushed and the middle really added no value. But overall, it was a fun film with plenty of humor and some good action, although the action seemed too busy at times.",
        "I knew what I was about to watch. Still, I wasn't fully ready for this. It's an amazing movie, every character had a great part. I'm pretty sure we're not even close to seeing everything from the Marvel Universe so I am excited to see what's next. Just as every Marvel movie, it had amazing actors and actresses. Truly wonderful.",
        "Hulk's glasses appear and reappear routinely from shot to shot without any shots of him putting them on or taking them off. In any event, with so many magical superpowers floating about ... one would think that Bruce Banner shouldn't have myopia or need to go to the opticians (on a buy one get one free basis) to get two sizes of glasses.",
        "Reasonably entertaining, but oddly paced, and perhaps too many characters to keep up to speed with. Enjoyable, but my least favourite in the Avengers series.",
        "Watch it and live without regret. Good story, great action, what else is there? Spider man was great, Robert Downy Jr steals the show as always. Thor was good as well. The Hulk was the only disappointment, but Mark Ruffalo is a crap actor anyway so I expected that. I haven't seen the other one with the blond girl everyone hates but this one is a winner. Sit back and enjoy the ride I say.",
        "Not sure why people rated so high for this pure entertaining hero movie. To me, a non-fan, it's still far from something called EPIC.",
        "It's funny it's a great movie with great reviews and is highly successful, overall. But, the trolls are coming out to play on imdb today, boy. It tied up previous loose ends from past films, it had a good story that was inventive, fun and clever. It had many easter eggs tied to past films and movies and is a great superhero film and a good film, period.\n\n9.4/10",
        "This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in my entire life!! It's the best super hero movie ever!! It deserves a lot of Oscars. It's just epic!!!",
        "I think this is the most great Avengers movie. This movie is really amazin",
        "The culmination of the infinity saga,this movie is going down in history as one of its kind. MIND-BLOWING MASTERPIECE.Words can't describe the grandiosity of this film. Worth watching more than once.",
        "Went to a late showing last night and wow!!! This movie was amazing!!! Loved the plot and overall look of the film. The cast was amazing as always especially Chris Evan's, Chris Hemsworth, and Robert Downey Jr, they went above and beyond in this movie. You will laugh, cry, and yell in excitement over this film. Definitely Marvels Best!!!!!",
        "Avengers Endgame is a perfect farewell packed with emotions and grandeur, must watch Marvel fans..",
        "Ironman play a great role.iron man and all the super hero are doing great",
        "The fact that some people disliked this movie honestly baffles me. This movie beyond exceeded my expectations. It was a perfect mix of humor within sadness. Throughout the movie I would constantly get goosebumps from the sheer epicness of the moment. Truly a perfect ending to an era. I applaud the directors.",
        "Best movie ever and most emotional movie I have ever seen. I love this movie so much and I have already watched it a lot. Very heartbreaking.",
        "Epic... simply EPIC! Hard to find a better word. Just... Epic! Bravo!",
        "I really don't get the hype around this mess. A group of \"super heroes\" try to save the world from aliens coming from the future, literally using punches and kicks. I don't even talk about plot holes, hollow delivery, and mindless action. We are living in the age of mediocrity, and movies are no exception.",
        "Didn't meet expectations which were pretty high to begin with after infinity war. As others have mentioned, too many plot holes, too many characters, just did not work for me. Captain Marvel was made to look uninspiring, and was grossly under utilized.the Abengers franchise lost it's charm.",
        "My son and I Loved infinity war 10 stars, great plot and character interaction, this one felt lacking in both. I'm glad others like it though, my kid who is 7 fell asleep \ud83d\udca4 at 1 hour, he asked me 40 mins in if it gets more interesting . When he awoke an hour later my answer was yes, but not much. Loved Captain America and the hammer, movie tingles in that scene. He might rate it lower?",
        "Literally the best movie thats exists! So much action I couldn't stop watching wow!",
        "Avengers: Endgame is not only the highest grossing film to date, it's the greatest film of all time. The emotion grabs me on, the action is fantastic, the music is strong, and the story is no more than well done. Definitely should watch this one with the whole family. Thank you Disney & MARVEL for an awesome conclusion to the legendary Infinity Saga \ud83c\udf7f",
        "No spoilers.\n\nThis film is genuinely incredible, absolutely perfect end to the chapter. The movie ties up loose ends you don't even know are loose, it's just fantastic. Really couldn't rate this film any higher, an emotional range as broad as you'd expect from Marvel. . Laughter, tears, and elation all in a matter of minutes. Go watch it!",
        "We all loved Robert Downey's Ironman, Chris Evans' Captain America, and they left a mark in our hearts that can never be replaced. I will root for the next phase of MCU movies, but I don't think it will have the same allure as the first one.",
        "Never have I heard so much cheering in a movie. Also, there was a lot of tears from grown men. Not myself of course, but being a huge Marvel fan, I mostly knew what to expect. I've loved almost all of the movies leading to this, and this did them justice. Many great heartfelt moments, some good action and of course they always sneak the humor in somehow. Even my wife loved this, and she's stuck by me for most of these. I hope it breaks all the records, and I can't wait to see what direction Marvel goes next with whoever that may be.",
        "That began roughly a decade ago. Avengers: Endgame is a fantastic love letter to fans of the MCU that brings more heart and fan service to the table, and maybe even a more satisfying ending, though I must admit that I got choked up a few times (didn't cry though, just barely). It's such a great close to several chapters in the MCU. As far as criticism goes. The only little drawbacks were that it doesn't quite match Infinity War's shock value and mind boggling action and that the movie's sci-fi plot device created some logical plot holes. I'll oeavitnatnthat, because I'm not posting spoilers and on balances I thought Endgame was awesome.",
        "Watching Avengers Endgame would go down as the experience of a lifetime, which will give you gamut of emotions ranging from laughter, goosebumps , crying and lots of crying. It is a great send off to some of our heroes. There is so much to write but i dont want to ruin anyone else's experience. Well Done Marvel....... :)",
        "It's the only superhero movie that I gave a rating of 10/10. But you can not NOT give a high rating, it's an end of a magnificent saga of great movies and I love it",
        "I'm A HUGE fan of the MCU but I'm not sure if the movie was bad or my expectations were too high. I found myself tapping my fingers and looking around the theater to find that others were bored as well.\n\nHonestly, the third act was more like previous MCU movies but it dragged getting there. This could have been a much shorter movie while maintaining the story and keeping fans from getting bored.",
        "While I am sad to see the Avengers saga end, Endgame was a great way to have it go out with a BANG! From beginning to end it was an amazing movie that you could even tell it was 3hrs long because it was fast paced! It was sad but hilarious in parts! Too bad it has to end but like I said what a way to end it all! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!",
        "This was the end game. Beautiful, emotional, loving, lots of action, I cried, I'm sad but satisfied and super happy \u2764\u2764\u2764 I dont have words to explain, well I cant explane words or no words.\n\nYou just have to watch it!\n\nYou'll see for yourself It's worth it and I maybe will go 2 more times to the theatre so much did I like it. Please give them Emmy awards!",
        "LITERALLY , one of the best movies i have seen in my entire life , filled with a tone of action and emotions . you will love avenger endgame . ' i love you 3000 '",
        "Great film and brings the series a a fitting and satisfying conclusion. A must see",
        "The action is outstanding but for me there was missed opportunities with some stuff and wasted screen time for other bits, 100% worth a watch but still way below Winter Soldier.",
        "This may perhaps be the most underrated film of all time. It was quite good, not great but still this movie got nowhere near the love and attention it deserves. It got nowhere close to the amount of money it deserved, so sadly I don't see a sequel coming our way any time soon. I guarantee this film will be more popular in 5-10 years. Ignore the mindless hater drones who attack this movie. Also to the mindless haters who continually dislike my reviews please stop now. Overall 7 out of 10 I liked it.",
        "Avengers endgame has been the greatest MCU movie since 2008. This movie is filled with sad and comedy scenes the plot is just great. Really worth it And don't let anyone spoil you the movie.",
        "I would agree with critics saying its a bit too hyped and overrated movie.Doesnt live upto my expectations. Sorry",
        "This movie was a collection of some past marvel sequels.(Avengers,Captain America,Thor,Guardians of the Galaxy)There are some scenes where you will say OMG,if it wasn't you are not a marvel fan.I am not going to post spoilers but remember doctor strange saw a one in a million posibility before he gave up the time stone to save \"Tony Stark\" in Infinity War.You would understand the reason in Endgame.",
        "Though the movie is decent, it in no way compares to Infinity War which was at least twice as good. This movie had two hours of boredom followed by a great third act. Wish they could of done this for the entire 3 hours vs just the last hour.",
        "I'll be honest and if people hate me, whatever. If you don't love this movie you are not a true fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThis is what we've been waiting for. This is it. It's the perfect MCU movie. It is literally everything we ever wanted and everything we could ever ask for. It's everything. It's the most important comic book movie there is.\n\nIt's Marvel's truest identity. You laugh so hard the you jerk out in your seat. You're jaw drops from how shockingly awesome it is. You cry because of the joy fullness you're witnessing. And you cry for a happy sadness that is the ending of an era.\n\nThere is not one thing I can think of that would be considered a negative. I can finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.",
        "By far the best movie I've ever seen. All the MCU films have been leading up to this and it does not disappoint! Go to watch this film before someone tells you what happens!",
        "Wow!! Hype is REAL!! The best superhero movie EVER!! Period.",
        "Honestly the best movie and cinematic experience ever. This is a perfect send off and anyone scoring it less than 10 is just trying to be controversial.",
        "It's a great closure. Epic as people called it. Heroes..",
        "Epic opening scene follow by 90 mins of nothing special followed by 80 mins of waves of poor quality to solid quality with a epic final battle scene. So many parts that made zero sense. The more time that goes on the less sense some of the story line makes. I could go on for hours about stuff that was negative and about 15 mins of quality to be spoken of. Look, everyone will watch for themselves. Ultimately disappointing unless your a stubborn baised superfan who believes marvel can do no wrong.",
        "This film was so much fun & love how Thanos was finally defeated once & for all.",
        "Right, this film is excellent. I would say I preferred Infinity War, as it was right in your face from the beginning. Now Endgame, has a lot of build up. So all that rubbish about not being able to go for a pee, in fear of missing something. Do so in the first two hours.\n\nWatch out for the peanut butter sandwich.",
        "Yep it's long, but it's packed from start to end. It didn't feel like three hours. There aren't any 'slow' parts, even the non-action bits are full of story so make sure to go to the bathroom before it starts.\n\nSome story lines are wrapped up, others are left open for the future. It doesn't feel like 'the end' at all.\n\nThere's really a lot of story, so much so that we are going to have to head back to the theater and see it again. And it will still be worth every penny spent.\n\nOne star is knocked off for a bit of universe continuity weirdness that will be evident when you watch it.",
        "It may have just been the high expectations set by the reviews, but this movie is not as good as the internet is making it out to be. Infinity War, in my opinion, was a much much stronger film overall. This was very poorly paced, had some really bad attempts of humour, and a lot of unnecessary scenes. The actual plot was quite good and kept me engaged, but the execution was lacking. Don't go into the cinema with high expectations because you may be disappointed.",
        "No spoilers. This movie is fabulous. From beginning to end you are inthralled with intrigue. From time to time you may be crying to laughing within seconds. The special effects and character interactions are also very well done. I highly recommend this movie.",
        "Im glad to live in a time where this movies existing.",
        "Better than infinity war. Ending is very emotional, and is very shocking. Wow, just Wow.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is better than I ever could have imagined!!! A love letter to the past decade with so many Easter eggs, just an absolute joyride. The last half hour is a spectacularly jaw-dropping, emotional, goosebumps-filled piece of cinema unlike anything we've seen thus far!! (A forever Christmas gift for my 10-yr old self)\n\nMarvel closed this out by pitching a perfect game!! Just ... wow. This 22-film story arc has been an amazing ride! Thank you, Marvel and everyone involved with the making of these films! #ThankyouAvengers",
        "The Avengers endgame was a great picture of bringing all the Avengers together help restore the world in the universe total sense of normalcy. Robert Downey Jr Chris Evans Chris Hemsworth Gwyneth Paltrow and many others made this a great movie and highly recommended for fans of the Marvel franchise.",
        "Before you start tearing your eyes out because you think this film was a masterpiece, I can assure you that it most certainly was not. Was it fun to watch? Absolutely. It was fun and funny but the film is riddled with plot holes and attempts to alter its entire arc to accommodate a wider universe that apparently relies on Captain Marvel which makes no sense. The film felt very lazy when it came to the interweaving of ten years of previous films and ultimately falls flat on its face. Perhaps the films after this will fix the mistakes but calling it the end of the infinity saga leads us to believe it is the beginning of an entirely new timeline saga since the timeline we knew is now long gone. Yes, despite cap returning the stones, the timeline we originally loved is now the past and this new five year ahead timeline is the world they want us to live in. No thanks. You'll need to earn my trust back.",
        "No spoilers. BEST movie saga wrap-up of ALL TIME! I've never seen a movie that was too good to spoil. It's that good!",
        "Satisfying 3-hours in which you go through a lot of emotions. And the best feeling is when you sit in a theater with NO empty seats, and everyone goes through the same thing like you do. We all clap when there's a satisfying scene that explains or goes well with all the references in the past. We all laugh out loud at MCU's clever and silly jokes. And we all cry when there's a sad thing happening (don't want to spoil you so that's all I can say).\n\nI guess that's all you need to know to understand that it's worth it to see the movie, and definitely more worth it to see it with other fellow MCU fans. It's been 12 hours and I'm still not over the movie yet, keep talking about it. Thank you Marvel for a successful movie series. Thank you for giving us years of awesomeness. You have made and ended the journey with extraordinary storytelling. Thank you!!",
        "Just watch it. LOADS OF FUN. Not any kind of masterpiece though. Doesn't come close to the best film of 2019 so far (Us)",
        "Will tug on the old heart strings and will be one of the best movies you will ever see.",
        "Though I have some issues with the way the last few years went with the Marvel universe (like the moronic identity political game they try to sell to us) this one was different while it is still there its easily looked over by the pure emotional build up that has been going for 11 years. I stand here saying that when I first saw iron man in theaters I could have never dreamt of such a thrill ride like this and with a near perfect ending.",
        "Loved the integration of all the heroes and the way it ended",
        "Goofy Fat Thor. Goofy Smart Hulk who don't even fight. Waiting for Hulk and Thanos battle and nothing happened. Just a confused time travel which brought plot holes.",
        "Looking back, this movie should have and could have been so much better. Yes, a fitting conclusion because it appears the MCU did die with Endgame. Everything from here on out looks to be woke cancer. Still, after the masterpiece of Infinity War, we all wanted better. Most characters were written out of character. What they did to Captain America and Hulk is criminal. The sad conclusion to Tony Stark's ark may be emotional but ultimately it was unnecessary. Add some cringe woke elements dribbling into this and it's clear why the movie wasn't as good as it should have been.",
        "Every single marvel movie serves as a stepping stone to this very movie. This movie is complete on every aspect from the beginning to the end. Every Avenger plays a significant role that tells their story to the full. Filled with action, emotion, comedy and a great storyline, this movie will blow everyone away in 2019 and beyond.\n\nThanks to Marvel and the Russo Brothers for making a movie that will make history in my personal books.",
        "GENERAL CONSENSUS (BAD, OK, GOOD, EXCELLENT): Excellent film and very good ending to the Tony Stark Marvel Era Saga.",
        "I always pity releases on same weekends with the Avengers franchise still playing.What does this release has for fans especially you reading this review?My response is simply. It has everything you need in a single motion.From casting to directing.With great characters coordination,an exemplary to the saying that biggest stars shine brighest before they die.Screenplay and dialogue great,setting and cinematography excellent,costume and editing faultless. The dark side has to do with acting,at particular point in time,one could see hyper-performances where it was not neccessary.Great movie,spotless in all dimensions of movie making",
        "This movies was not bad but after seeing Infinity War I was expecting better. 7/10",
        "Ending of the Avenger with awesomeness but I feel little slow than other Avenger because of too emotional scenes.",
        "I understand that there are still many Marvel films in the works but this really did feel like a conclusion to the 20+ films that came before. Great action sequences with a lot of payoffs for anyone who has seen the previous film and will run you through the entire scope of emotions. There is one seen in particular that was incredible and gave me goosebumps. This is something we've never seen happen before and something we may never again. It really took so many pieces to fall in place and for that this film will stand the test of time and should be considered a milestone event, rather than just a great film. For those reason this is a 10/10 film.",
        "I don't know why, but I always fall a sleep watching superhero movies. Managed to watch this one 40 minutes before snoring. There is something that switches my brain off, don't know what. Good for insomnia though. Can't really rate this one or the other, unless 20-40 minutes is enough for that. Giving this one 5.",
        "Avengers Endgame is about the remaining Avengers trying to get the world back to normal. They run into many problems though.\n\nAvengers Endgame was a great movie. First, the acting was great. All the actors in this movie did a great job. The story was also great. It made me feel like it wasn't 3 hours. All the story telling made it feel like the movie wouldn't have been as good without some of the story. Also the acting was great. I know it has been in most of the films but I still had to congratulate it. There was also many great scenes in this movie. The ending was just really moving and awesome.\n\nOverall, Avengers Endgame was a great movie.",
        "Today is 24th april and I booked the ticket of 28th april and I know it is the best movie would I watched ever.so I already rated 10 out of 10. Love from india.",
        "This film was a beautiful ending to the saga of Avengers, although we do not know if there are more films awaiting us. It was such a meaningful film, with so many touching moments that make us think back to the old times of Avengers, one of the most iconic groups we will ever see in this generation. Avengers made me cry, which was not expected. Not one single superhero adventure saga movie has ever made me cry. But this one did. Infinity War left me breathless, and Endgame left me even more speechless. Iron Man's death was so well crafted, so deep and meaningful. This film portrays everything Marvel ever had. Everybody. One huge entire family. The film unfolding every step of the way. This film is truly an unforgettable one.",
        "Superhero stuff happens and there is about as much depth as the first edition of pong.",
        "I watched the movie twice so that I can give a proper review and get clarity on my thoughts . The first time watching the movie was a rollercoaster ride but the second time around I could appreciate it much more ... Yes there are many flaws in the movie without a doubt but it gives an amazing closure to most of our beloved characters. Joy and sadness ....",
        "Some smart creative choices were made in this movie. Thanos is great. Captures the spirit of superhero crossover genre.",
        "Perhaps the best of the Avengers series, this film still had some issues. It's a bit long, the time travel subplot is filled with holes, some characters appear for only 2-3 minutes or so and it's painfully predictable.\n\nStill the film is somehow enjoyable, maybe because they created lot's of interesting characters/heroes in the last 10 years and I found myself caring about them in the course of the film.\n\nI would say this would have definitely been a better film but it's still fun to watch.",
        "Thank you for making us happy and satisfied. It's worth waiting for. \ud83c\udf7b",
        "The movie's title says it all. The End of such a great ERA.\n\nJust go for the movie but try to watch the previous 20 films of the MCU then you will be able to enjoy the most out of it.",
        "The film has no pace besides the big battle that in fact is to short and feels like nothing according to what I expected for a new fight with e thanos\n\nSome character directions of important heroes like Thor and hulk where ridiculous . And these characters contributed nothing to the stories besides transmitting weakness\n\nAlso the movie was overwhelmed by overpowering woman and non white characters . I understand the need to give equal importance to every king of heroe but not to the cost of the most importa ones .\n\nAlso the script was full of things without logic",
        "Wow, that was a major anti climax. With a title as 'Endgame' you'd expect it to surpass every story before, not an endless get together, 1 major battle where 1 action here solves it all and then a lengthy farewell. Wished they would have spent more on a good script instead of on 1 big scene full of CGI",
        "It builds from a haunting melancholy tune to a thundering, iron-willed anthem for everything that's great about MCU and comic books in general. Twists, turns, surprises, tears, smiles and memories.. as close to a perfect conclusion to \"Infinity War\" one could hope!",
        "It's was one of my best Experiences ever. It's a memory that I will share with my childrens & Grandchildrens",
        "This was the best adieu to last 11 years of marvel. It was emotional, i can still feel the gossebumps. It had its own flaws and I didn't get 1 or 2 answers i was looking in this movie but in the end I was satisfied, the second half went on another level and some set pieces will be remembered for years to come. Once in a decade a movie in this genre comes who defines the genre, the previous 10 years was The Dark Knight from this year onwards it would be Endgame.",
        "This movie was just beautiful, ten years of movies and this one is the best, not a very emotional person when it comes to movies, I rarely cry, and I did, more than once actually. It was just amazing, everything, vfx, soundtrack, marvel, what a ride, everything I espected and more, it deserves everything it has everything. It deserves to be between the best, because it is one of the best. Just marvelous. It's perfect, just love it! Thank you Marvel, thank you to everyone who made this movie, cast, director\u00b4s, producer, just every single one of then. What a ride!!! Love it 3000",
        "Captain marvel scenes at the beginning and captain marvel at the end when she saves everyone made this movie amazing.",
        "Obviously i loved the movie. After watching it probably 30 times im watching it again right now and it just hit me when Ant Man comes back. So hes walking down the street and theres junk,wrecked cars,and trash piled up every where. Than he gets to the memorial. How is it they had the man power to make hundreds of stones with thousands of names but couldnt get anyone to pick up the trash???",
        "Absolutely speechless.... I have no words to express the absolute masterpiece that marvel has created. Exceptional!",
        "I'm a fan of sci-fi movies & following the marvel series I just enjoyed the endgame every second of it..",
        "THAT is how a movie should be made. Explains a lot with addition to more. Humor, drama, action, Sci-Fi, excellent CGI as always, even thrilling at times. Overall a perfect movie for what it is.",
        "Great work from all actors .. alot of emotions we laughed alot and confused alot and finally we was very happy for this work thanks alot marvel",
        "Between the hype , expectations and the facts .. i can -with a clear consciousness - call this an extremely overrated movie ..",
        "This movie is total lit u will witness all kinds of human emotions possible even if u are a tough punk who feels he can't feel anything it is the finale of all 21 movies a story telling saga of greatness avoid spoilers it is the best movie there can ever be if you are not watching it i u are missing to be part of something really big at the end thank u avengers thank u marvel i have just no words to describe what I guys gaved and delivered worth it totally",
        "An incredible journey, emotions, story, action etc. Only one word.................. No Word",
        "This superhero movie does it all. It will make you laugh, cry and go beaming with excitement. This movie met everybody's expectations ; might I say even exceeded them, and won our hearts and entertained us yet again on the largest scale possible.\n\nAlthough some may find the first half of the movie a bit slow and long (but definitely not boring) , it is essential as it covers a lot of ground , and is nevertheless fun to watch and ultimately leads us to what will be known forever as the MOTHER OF ALL CLIMAXES.",
        "This film was much more than I expected, each scene, each dialogue, a remarkable and unforgettable MASTERPIECE",
        "That's not fair with Thor and Hulk. They haven't done, what they known for And I dnt knw why Captain Marvel was introduced, she has done nothing in the movie.",
        "In the beginning, it is a complementary movie to the Marvel series, and in my opinion they should have stopped events from the previous part The visual effects, directing and script are very good But the story contained some illogical things A traditional ending in all movies Terrible mistakes in physics But the representational performance of some actors remains more than good We hope to improve the events and logic in the coming parts if any Thank you",
        "Avengers: Endgame was mindblowing and awesome. It is the best MCU movie ever. It is even better than Avengers: Infinity War and it exceeded my wildest expectation.",
        "I couldn't have imagined a better conclusion to the Infinity Stones saga. This movie has everything and hits all the right emotional beats along the way. I can't wait to see it again!",
        "Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Avengers: Endgame. For once I am at a loss for words. I have just sat through three hours of an absolute roller coaster of emotions. I laughed, I cried, there was shock, relief, and sorrow and just a little bit of awe. I have an immense amount of praise for the writers being able to draw the threads of the story together to produce such an outcome. For those of us that love the Marvel universe, I say Wow!!!!! I really can't think of anything else to say without a huge bunch of spoilers so I'm just going to say, if this is your thing......it was awesome......please go any watch it.....then go and watch it again!!!!",
        "11 years in making n it was really worth a wait!! its simply the best marvel movie till date!! tears all the way!!! excitement n sadness n joy at full peak!! n guess what?! brie larson is right there as we wanted her to be!!! spot on!! the best version of captain marvel we can get!! avengers endgame is will pull the inner fan out of you at fullest!!",
        "Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlet Johanson and Josh Brolin were stunning so as the rest others.\n\nPlease don't die if you haven't watched it yet. But in order to watch this, you have to make sure that you have watched the rest other films of MCU. This is an epic conclusion to the 20 films.",
        "Soooo. Just finished the movie and this will not contain any spoilers but I need to voice my heart to all Marvel lovers... 22 movies over 11 years and this one movie profoundly used all of them in the final conclusion. My heart is saddened by the end but so over joyed by the extreme care the Russo brothers took to preserve stan lees finally curtain call. This movie was the perfect mix of humor and emotion and I can tell you I have never cried so much in a movie ever... Being an iron man can it truly does end exactly where it begun!!! Phenomenal movie, true cinematic perfection and this movie will sweep come oscars time. But words cannot express my feelings! The end of an era and a movie that will top box office records for centuries to come!!! Thank you marvel, and thank you to the actors for giving the fans something to remember for a lifetime",
        "If you are a Marvel Fan and has watched all the marvel movies since Iron Man (2008) then this movie will be surely an emotional Ride for you. The direction of this movie is just brilliant. The action, the screenplay, the ending is top notch. A movie just can't get better than this!",
        "The Marvel Cinematic Universe has given us a lot of great characters and pulling of a final movie that uses all their unique abilities equally was always going to be a near impossible task. Endgame is proof of that. It didn't feel like the Avengers became a real team or learned much during these 22 movies. Their plans and tactics felt amateurish. I was hoping for something deeper and cleverer, but that never materialized. It was entertaining, well produced and acted, but for me it never got near masterpiece territory.",
        "The better the ratings on a sci-fi movie the worse the science, but who cares if we're being fed thus absorb \"fake\" information. More combustion powered & structurally dumb space vehicles making sounds in the vacuum of space & swooshing sounds in air. Well, looks cool as do all the super powers that seem to get crazier w/each new series release. Why are little things like glassy rocks so empowered in sci-fi/fantasy movies? Usual dumbed down dialogue except the three worded line by one famous (and the movie is loaded w/famous) actor (bet you can't guess who). Started slow, but got hot 'n' heavy towards the end.",
        "The movie was entertaining, but so many missing details In the story. I did not like the ending as well",
        "This movies is the greatest superhero movie to ever be created. Robert Downey jr. portray Iron man I couldn't see anyone else playing as iron man. This movie is very sad because it's an end of an error this has been a 11 year in to the making of this movie. I would suggest to watching this movie there a great story and excellent finishing",
        "It was good but not great. The first hour is way to long. A nice ending and a good attempt with a lot of old references.",
        "Absolutely FANTASTIC movie!! Very worthy end to a long cinematic history. Not often a movie gets this emotional, funny, exciting and heroic all rolled into one very refined roll. The Russo brothers have done it! Absolutely blown away! From being corny now and then to an emotional rollercoaster right after that. A masterpiece!",
        "The title says it all........... A Fitting End to an Amazing Saga. Excelsior!!!!",
        "A worthy follow-up to Infinity War with a lot of action, humour and drama. Couple of plot contrivances, but you can easily overlook them.",
        "Thank you marvel for this wonderful movie. This movie made me laugh, cry and excited. This Movie is the ending of The infinity saga . It is truly the endgame",
        "This movie has been highly anticipated. I prepared for it. Saw all the MCU MOVIES and took a friend along who is even nerdier than I am. A masterpiece work of art by the Russo Brothers and truly worth every second of it",
        "Lived up to expectations. Every single minute of the movie had me wondering what was going to happen next. Enough movement in the storyline that it never was boring. But I will say, bring your tissues!!",
        "Finally got to watch the most anticipated movie, the saga that continued to never cease to amaze us from 12 years. I had never seen a movie like this until today. I have sore my throat during the ending. I don't want to spoil it so please must go and grab your tickets.",
        "Saying this is the best movie ever is the equivalent of only watching the season finale of a series without having any context and saying it's the best series ever?! It is entertaining and awe inspiring how they handled the huge cast ensemble, but as a standalone film it is rather lacking. Great if you love the MCU, but it rather bloated in runtime and typically sentimental. Great if you want \"checkout\" for a few hours and enjoy some of the action sequences and the trademark quips expected from this production house.",
        "More like Avengers EndMyLife because jeez this film is overrated. It's just special effects.",
        "All I can say is that everything that you want to happen happens but there is also things that I didn't expect to happen but all good things. Simply this is a fitting end to the saga 10/10!!!!",
        "10 years, 22 movies has come to an end.\n\nThis movie provides laughter tears and joy. It is the perfect ending for most of the characters and a New beginning for Some. If this movie doesnt get an award im stumped.\n\nThanks for making this movie. And i am hopefull for the future of the MCU.",
        "So for the longest time my two favourite movies were Empire Strikes Back and Jurassic Park......Well times change because its now Empire Strikes Back and Avengers Endgame.\n\nThis movie was perfect that's all I can say there is absolutely no flaws a perfect way to end an era of MCU..\n\n10/10 a flawless movie and now my second favourite movie of all time..... Perfect. #MCU #avengersendgame",
        "Being a marvel fan I was very excited to watch it. This turned out to be little disappointing. Still enjoyable, but I think \" infinity war\" was way way good.",
        "One critic said this movie was a, \"glorious conclusion\". I say it was one nutpunch after another. So..... a glorious nutpunch? Take a hanky..a ton of napkins,....something ti blot the tears away. Trust me...you're gonna need it.",
        "Most satisfying ending ever. My childhood is complete.",
        "The perfect blend of action, comedy and emotion and it all works really well",
        "Mixture of events. Great effort. There was no need for that sad ending. They just did it to finish the series. It HAS AFTER CREDIT SCENES. Pay close attention to the sound you hear there ;-)",
        "How do you sum up the culmination of ten years of cinematic brilliance in two sentences? By simply saying it is pretty damn good.",
        "It was an amazing culmination for the first phases of the MCU.",
        "It did a great job wrapping everything up but at the same time it's hard to have the same emotional impact that Infinity War delivered to the table.",
        "It is absolutely the best....I can say without doubt...there are many movies in the universe...but endgame is one in a billion....action packed,emotional ... good story...full of humour. There's nothing like it",
        "I'd say the perfect end for this series even if the ending is a little hard to take. There is a ton of action - well made CGI - not too many mistakes in logic and heartbreaking moments.\n\nI'll miss it waiting for a continue.\n\nIf you don't see it the movie in cinema you'll not get the whole beauty of it.",
        "While watching #AvengersEndgame, I laughed too much, I clapped too much and I cried so hard. The movie exceeds every expectation and is the perfect condition of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nWatch all 21 MCU movies before watching #endgame\n\nWe love you 3000 times...",
        "It is a great film to end an era. Everything that leads to are im this fking awesome movie.",
        "This movie took my expectations and shattered them. I was stuck glued to the theater screen for all 3 hours not wanting to look away or blink. The perfect blend of humor, action, and emotionally powerful scenes. At first I was finding to tough to believe they would be able to surpass the events of Infinity War, but I knew the Russo Brothers and great team behind this movie were gonna be able to pull it off. And they did just that. The hour of the movie left me with tears of joy and tears of sadness at the time. By the time I was leaving the movie theater my eyes were and stingy due to the amount of tears I had cried. As someone who has been watching MCU movies since the very beginning and seen every single one this move was true worth the 10+ year wait. Could not be happier.",
        "There are so many surprises and twists in this film. I believe it's really a perfect ending for the first decade of MCU!! Couldn't be better!!",
        "One of the best superhero movies. But didn't like it as much as Infinity War or Dark Phoenix.",
        "Overall the film had a very satisfying end to a decade long story.",
        "Now i might be from the minority, but the first couple of hours of this movie were not that great. However, the last hour was just a mix of amazing and amazinnger",
        "No Negative reviews.. This is one of my most favourite movies of 2019",
        "This was truly the first time that as I was watching, I felt like I immediately recognized a movie's future significance. The duology of Infinity War and Endgame, I believe, will be remembered as the pinnacle of superhero movies. That's all there is to it.",
        "Speechless...\n\nI just can't find proper words to describe what I've just watched..... I just wanna say thank you and congratulations for all the ones involved in this epic, masterpiece, production... billions stars couldn't grade this movie...\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb Uow, I've just found the words!",
        "I remember back in 2008 at the cinema, seeing Iron Man for the first time and was just blown away by Downey Jr.'s performance, and the excellent and funny script with one of several incredible origin stories.\n\nEndgame is the 22nd consecutive film in the MCU and just to imaging that they would pull of this 10 year, Multi-Billion dollar project is almost too much to comprehend.\n\nEndgame is a perfect mix of seriousness, humour, epic battles and a farewell to the movies and characters we've all come to love so much.\n\nAfter my second watch I upgraded this movie to 10/10. Endgame is everything I could have ever hoped for and truly the perfect ending to the best Super Hero series of films ever made.",
        "A lot of people have talked about this move like it is the best movie ever made, so i had high expectations for it. Sadly i don't see it. The action scenes were awesome, but that's the only thing it had. The rest was just meh.",
        "Growing up on the MCU films has given me a connection to these characters that makes this movie amazing. My only problem with the movie was the step backwards they took with Thor from Ragnarok and Infinity War. But not A big enough issue to lower this from a 10. Well worth the 3 hours, doesn't feel long at all. In fact the pacing was pretty quick.",
        "This movie was the best avengers movie and I think it wrapped up the Captain America and iron man storyline very well. This movie was very emotional. The movie did not feel like 3 hours long it felt like a one hour movie . Overall great movie and great Characters really enjoyed it.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is the perfect epic ending to the brilliant Avengers franchise. It succeds in mixing features of an intense dramatic movie with a superhero one. Powerful performances and the beautiful mind of the Russo Brothers make this movie worth to be seen more than only once. This is soon gonna be a cult movie. Rating: 9,5",
        "This perfectly ties the entire Avengers \"series\" together, with an ending that left me sad but content. Marvel does INCREDIBLE with every movie but this one hit different. If you haven't seen it yet, I suggest refreshing yourself with some past movies, obviously there are a ton of references and ties from the entire story.",
        "...great cast but lack of script.\n\n.........................",
        "It was way too long and overrated. Infinity War was a much better movie. I don't get all the hype.",
        "9/10 - an impressive cast list, an enthralling storyline, and an epic end to an era enables this superhero flick to stand out among the increasing monotony of the genre",
        "Marvel knows how to make us all grow attached to a franchise! I don't know how but they continue to amaze us all!",
        "Wow .. ok the story is straight forward ,yes sometimes too much to process and if u think about it you might find flows but the main thing that made that movie great is just how easily it makes you fell every emotion the scene wants you to feel , you want to cry you will cry or at least feel terribly sad u want to laugh , be exited you will 100% . Also the amount of references is a a lot . Honestly I don't think they (MCU) can top that at least on the emotional scale .",
        "Infinity was was better than end game. what you have done with thor is not good",
        "Very good film i really enjoyed it it was cool loads of action obviously and both funny and quite sad , the only problem i have is did it really need to be 3 hours long .....?",
        "Infinity war is way way way better than end game.i didn't like the story that much. expected much more, i am not satisfied.",
        "I have stayed away from the internet so that I didn't get to find out any of the storyline and spoil watching the film. This film had a tough act to follow but overall I think it did. My only criticism is that it maybe tried to be too funny at times, Infinity war was a much darker film. You can't please everyone and some of the really low ratings and bad reviews on here are ridiculous, some people need to get a grip. Overall this is a great film, full of twists, action, surprises, emotion and humour. Judge for yourselves! If this truly is the end of the road for some of the main characters I'm curious as to the focus of future Marvel films.",
        "Its sad to see it come to an end. But im satisfied by how it ended and how the story went through. With the usual expected sense of humor in marvels movies and a good story line.",
        "This is not just a Movie it's an Emotional Goodbye of Favourite Characters from Last Decade . This Journey of 22 Movies Was and Will Always be a Favourite for Billions of People around the World .It's Bigger , Better and Full of Fandom Moments",
        "What an ending to an era of Marvel movies. There are scenes when your heart goes out to the characters. The story starts out slowly but catches momentum and by the end you are gripping your seats in anticipation. And it is beautiful how each character is given space and importance. Truly an epic movie which all Marvel fans will cherish...even the end credits.... What a way to close the movie.",
        "Truly amazing, i love how it was done in three parts. Act one dealing with the loss, act two getting the team and plan together and act three all out brawl for redemption!!!",
        "We've spent 11 years waiting for this peak 3 hours. Thank you Marvel. It was the most \"everything\" I've ever seen.",
        "I have seen Avengers Endgame on 24 April 2019 in Cinema. You like Avengers Infinity War, then you will like Avengers Endgame too. This Movie is same good how Avengers Infinity War. In Avengers Endgame we have got a big great battle too. All in one is Endgame a GREAT Avengers movie and a MUST watch movie (in cinema).",
        "This is one of the best action/superhero movies I have ever seen. It wraps the infinity saga up real good.",
        "I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.\n\nI loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure. Time travel destroys any film...time travel doesnt exist in the physical world..",
        "Amazing movie 10/10 would watch again ending was sad tho",
        "To describe this movie, let's just say it was 'AWESOME!!'. The plot hole might be confusing for some people. But if you are a true marvel fan, you will be able to understand the storyline here. And yeah! NUFF SAID!!",
        "I found that this was a perfect conclusion of some characters stories and for the most part, Phase 3",
        "Like any other Marvel movie, this one is also very mediocre. If you have watched all the others and are with the HYPE, then you definitely want to watch this. However, keep in mind that this movie is very average. The music is nothing special, camerawork is very normal and the script is very cheesy and predictable. This movie is also very long and it doesn't have to be. I will probably forget this movie in a month or two.",
        "Surely I'm not the only one to walk out of the theatre and feel this way? It's not just about the hype. I was bored. It was dull and uninspiring and felt like the Iron Man show. I am a huge Marvel fan as are my two sons and we all left feeling let down. Nonsense about the LGBTV character- this was one of the Russos with a few lines of dialogue in a three hour movie - really!!!! As for the 'female empowerment scene' this felt like a cheesy afterthought. Yes it has answers but it could have been so much more. We left the theatre after Infinity War and rebooted to see it again. I will not be rushing to see this movie again.",
        "Had huge expectations from End Game after the ending of Infinity War and it just fell flat after initial 40 min's.\n\nMovie feels boring at lot of places and the ending....lets not talk about it... could have been more sensational. There are few moments having humour...but those moments are very shortlived. What worst...made martyr of character whose movies were the best of all Marvel Universe.",
        "The biggest minus is, the movie is rushed up. Way too many things to solve and conclude even in this marathon of three hours. Some lost battle opportunities between some characters, plot holes, lazy writing and not enough explained things. But you cannot explain everything and please everybody in a superhero movie. Maybe a trilogy of 7 hours in total, instead of two movies of 5.40 cumulated would have been better. Anyway. The movie is not bad. It has some good performances, especially RDJ's one, it is emotional, it has totally unexpected turns and of course the pretty CGI. It is worth the wait and worth seeing it in cinema 3D. But don't you dare drink something before, or until the last half hour. 3h long, remember?",
        "The end of the 11 year of journey is here and what a movie it is we cried, laugh,joy the every movement foen the movie we can't express the movie in the words. Such a beautiful work by russo brothers and mcu and what a great end is given to all cherecters.",
        "The movie is One of the best movies that I ever watched it was to emotional and too exiting f... I cried 3 times at it the twist was very good and a very amazing directors and for real thank you Russo brothers and thank you Stan Lee for this masterpiece and may you rest in peace Stan",
        "That 3 hours just flew by too fast! Never have I been in a movie as packed as this theater was and as lively as the crowd was. There was cheering several times during the movie and crying from some at certain times, gasping and shouting lol! This moviehad it all including almost every person ever involved in a Marvel movie (except Coulsen) but I'm binging Agents of Shield with my GF right now so we'll get our Coulsen fix later lol! Sad to say goodbye to many years of Marvel movies but excited for phase 4!",
        "This movie gets nine and a half stars for anyone seeing all the mainstream Marvel films. It ties everything together so wonderfully. Such clever writing. Only a couple of small problems, clunkers added by Disney to sell their woke version of political correctness, but on every other level, extremely well done.",
        "Perfect ending to a great story that we have been lucky to see over the last decade",
        "Just very satisfied, very entertained, and very much wanting to see it again and again! Also, very happy to have been a part of the whole saga and very much wanting to share this experience with our grandkid. What a ride!",
        "The best movie of the Marvel Cinematic universe.., Power packed with comedy, emotions, action.... etc. All the cast and crew are worked hard. I think everybody go and watch the movie.. Experience it in IMAX 3D",
        "Best endgame for The 10 years, you won't believe your own eyes and it's surpass of all the expectation.\n\nPart of journey is the end.\n\n\"I am Iron Man\" -Iron Man/Tony Stark",
        "I had high hopes and was not let down. It's emotionally draining, I needed an hour afterwards just to get back to normal. Perfection folks. See this movie.",

        "What a movie! Only one fight, and best end fight \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f",
        "It was DEFINITELY better than \"Infinity War.\" It was so good, it didn't even FEEL like it was three hours, and I didn't need to use the bathroom. So funny, action packed and kind of emotional. Since it has passed \"Avatar\" in the box office, it should have an Oscar nomination for \"Best Picture.\"",
        "I've been waiting for this film since April 2018 after Infinity War. I've read theories etc and the anxiety skyrocketed the two weeks leading up to the opening. Now that I've seen it I can say think Infinity War might be a 'better' film but that might only be because of the unique nature of it (the heroes having lost and the villain trying to be impartial). I think people who don't pay attention to the dialog in End Game will need to see the film more than once. On first glance even avid MCU fans well versed in all the films will say 'wait, but,....' until you remember what the characters who have spent time in space explain to those who have not.... so without spoiling thing folks might need to look at diagrams relative to the film \"Primer\" to fully understand what is being exercised in End Game.",
        "The movie had some bad points but mostly it was amazing also when iron man dies it's so sad",
        "A+, Epic, Amazing, Phenomenal. They tied the entire series of 21 movies together almost perfectly. Movie making at its absolute finest. The only question now is, how can Marvel ever top it?",
        "Amazing. Enjoy the roller coaster. A perfect conclusion to this story arc. 3000/10",
        "The movie has a ton of plotholes and things that you'll think about after the movie. That being said you should enjoy this movie if you're a Marvel fan. Many great actors, superheroes, action, etc. Must watch if you've been keeping up with all of the other MCU movies.",
        "I confess I am not an Avengers fan having missed much of the franchise since Iron Man. However as preparation for my trip to the cinema to see Endgame I thought I would catch up on the story by watching Infinity War and Ragnarok. I actually enjoyed both of these a lot more than Endgame. It promised to be quite a spectacle and the scale of the action sequences didn't disappoint. Some of the personal stories of the characters were also introduced quite well into the film. However unlike the simpler story lines of the previous two films as mentioned I think they tried just too hard with Endgame. Too many pieces of the plot thrown into the story just made it overwhelming and took the shine off what would otherwise have been a good conclusion.",
        "Would be great if adam warlock was in it. Nice movie, nothing more, nothing less. Maybe too much expectations.",
        "If you're a Marvel fan, this movie literally has everything. Nothing is left out. No stone unturned and all are cared for with incredible deftness. To weave together 21 movies into one HUGE and epic finale, while very properly tying up loose ends, is just beyond impressive. The cheers, the sacrifices, the resolutions, all are so very well done for this type of genre. This movie entertains on a scale that \"hitherto\" has never been seen. Lol. No other movie franchise has come close to matching the MCU magic, and none ever will. This was very special and a masterful piece of comic book action movie making.",
        "What more could you ask for?\n\nThis movie is epic.",
        "Headline says it all, one of the best movies ever made. The culmination of the Infinity Saga and the storyline for so many characters. The best conclusion since The Return of the King.",
        "Topsy turvy. One minute you're happy, the next you're wondering why you're sad. Fantastic finish to an excellent group of films. Gutted it's all ended for this generation but times change I guess. It's been a long and emotional rollercoaster, enjoyable, gripping and funny when it was needed. I hope Captain Marvell remains the same and has more films ahead (because she is hot and we don't see enough of her). Meh. Don't know what else to say. Feels like the end of an era, which it is. Roll on the next generation.",
        "MY MOST FAVORITE FILM!!! Who left a mark on my heart forever. All the best actors united in one masterpiece. I advise everyone to watch it for any evening in the circle of close people with their favorite drinks and goodies.",
        "Avengers End Game is by far the most gorgeous and detailed Cinematic movie ever. Full of emotions and a true character representation. No unnecessary scenes and a true reflection of the hardwork of the MCU. This blissful. Everyone deserves to watch this magnificent piece.",
        "There is one way to describe this movie and that is satisfying. It is satisfying in the way that everything you would want to see resolved is resolved and even things established in other movies have conclusions/payoffs. There are too many standout moments to count as everyone will have their own favorite moment. I don't know if we will ever see something like this ever again from marvel, but it is a movie that must be seen if you have invested your time in all these characters. You will not be disappointed",
        "Perfection That is all i can say I love u 3000 Avengers",
        "What a huge disappointment. Hulk is a wimp. Thor is a fat drunk. No fight scenes. I am a huge Marvels fan I could not have been more disappointed with this movie. Anyone saying this was great needs to be evaluated.",
        "You have seen a zillion movies and think you know everything a film maker can do .And then you watch this and all that ego shatters to dust. I never can believe the emotion the film brought in me . The one line (spoiler alert) that I AM IRON MAN destroys you away. Just unbelievable",
        "Saw Endgame twice yesterday! The action, the humour, the drama, the emotions are off the charts! Epic doesn't even comes close when talking about this Marvel of a superhero movie! Avengers Assemble!",
        "Marvel proved me VERY wrong. It was one of the best movies I have seen in 20 years. The links to the past and the empathy of the new stories made it 3 hours of pure pleasure. I bloody loved it!",
        "First of it will remove your stress if you are thinking about what will be the next or what will thanos do. That's it. Beside that, this movie is almost like crap. Sometimes they want to be serious, sometimes funny, sometimes emotional. What a mess. They had created a hype by Infinity War and now break all the records. I think all credit goes to Infinity war. They should have to take time to write a good screenplay. I guess they don't take time because the hype will be damaged. And now give the people a crap.",
        "Just finished watching it in China, fantastic CG job, but I think the story should be better, maybe make it a two-ending will be better",
        "I dan't believe this only has an average rating of 8.8. Probably the best movie in it's genre.",
        "The film is extremely draggy but with good reason (the leading up and ending). After all, this is the end of the Avengers franchise. Direction, production value, acting, etc etc was all top notch.\n\nThe only thing i was pretty let down about was the script/screenplay. Just very repetitive, straight forward, no twists, no wow moments (except the ending) and using the same dramatic music was a bit cliche. But in retrospect, i understand. They did the best they could do given what they were dealt.\n\nThis must have been a very emotional movie to conclude for the whole cast and crew given by the extremely long good bye. I commend everyone for a fantastic job.",
        "Left me shocked despite the theories building up to the film. I'm mentally exhausted from watching it but my god, they definitely end on a high! I couldn't have asked for a better ending.",
        "Words can't describe the feeling! Movie of the century!",
        "Marvel done very well and know what we as a fans want. Some of the movie lines u won't know if u not a hardcore marvel fans. The story plot caught me by surprise that it can done in this way. Every emotion u can think of, all can find in this movie.I like Black widow performance in this movie.",
        "After IW I was expecting a great sequel. I rented end game on Prime Video. I wish I had saved my money. The first part of the movie was so slow and when they finally picked the action up it was so dark and the characters moved so fast it was hard to tell who was who. I had no idea who Captain Marvel was. And why wasn't the Hulk involved in the final battle? I think they could have made a better movie.",
        "This movie did everything great. There were some brilliant moments where I got Return Of The King vibes and I was pumped out of my mind. They really surprised me with how they chose to play this one out and all I can say is the Russos pulled it off amazingly. Also the soundtrack was incredible with a spectacular final act.",
        "The final chapter of Marvel's Phase Three of the MCU has everything that a fan of these movies wants! It has an ending for the ages and Easter eggs to many to count. It took 21 movies to get there, so filled with to the brim with callbacks to previous movies and it gives a ending to numerous story arcs in a satisfied way. As usual, Marvel knocks it out of the park with a blockbuster that looks impressive, has an incredible cast, iconic characters and a story that will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat for all of the 3 hour run-time.",

        "One of, if not the best superhero movies I have ever seen. A must watch!",
        "Endgame wraps up the entire MCU in a nice little bow and allows you a decision: stop watching Marvel products and feel a sense of closure, or keep watching and use Endgame as a springboard for what's to come. Either way, this is an incredibly satisfying movie. The only reason I couldn't give it 10/10 is because this also, sadly, reinforced how much I hate Captain Marvel and Brie Larson; her five or six minutes of screen time were the only minutes that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.",
        "Acting - 10/10 Screenplay - 10/10 Music - 10/10 Action - 10/10 VFX - INFINITY/10 Direction - 10/10",

        "It couldnt be better than this. I enjoyed every second of this cinematography icon.",
        "I have never seen any movie like Avengers Endgame in my life . It Is the most unique and ambitious movie I have seen in my entire life . Endgame end's the first Era of the MCU Perfectly . 10/10 A+",
        "A movie which was not expected but a movie which was truly deserved.",
        "This is definitely the pinnacle of Marvel's years of story building, so epic, so mesmerizing, so perfect. I couldn't imagine any superhero movie could be any greater than this, at least not in the foreseeable future. I don't think anybody should miss this movie. Watch it while it's still playing on theatres. This could be the greatest movie of this decade, or even any decade for that matter.",
        "Wow!One of the best films I've ever watched. The fight scenes were intense,the acting was phenomenal so is the humor.",
        "This movie was so overhyped so it hurt the review but it's a better then average movie. The beginning is slow which is fine cause it usually creates tenseness; however, the movies pacing jumps along to going fast and then back to slow. It's pacing is bad and vary irritating. There were many unexplained plot holes too. Usually this is fine but the audience needs details especially in a lore as deep as marvels. There was too much emotion and it didn't have to end the way it did. Still is a must see and a good film, just not the conclusion we needed.",
        "This is the perfect film to sign off with. It was beautiful on every level. Love the start middle and end .",
        "Just so so good. It absolutely deserves it's number one grossing film of all time. So much better than avatar, and a truly epic ending to an epic super story.",
        "One of those movies you love more and more as time goes by. At first I was like \"why did they do that??\" \"omg they messed up x and y and z!\". But... It's a perfect movie and your subconscious will accept this eventually.\n\nFrom 6/10 to 10/10. :)",
        "If you're am MCU fan then this movie is pure magic. The characters have never felt more human, the performances particularly Downey, Evans, Scarlett and Renner are terrific and the third act is pure comic book magic. If you're not a fan of mcu movies then this movie will probably confuse the hell out of you, the Russo's made this movie for all the fans and I cannot thank them, the screenwriters and Kevin Feige enough",
        "Cheap trick my Disney to try and overtake Avatar! I am furious the Disney said that there will be a few surprises and some deleted scenes (plural). I was honestly expecting to see them within the movie or some extra dialogue, but nothing. The 1 scene AFTER the credits was not even noteworthy and had not even been finished. Complete let down. The original had no end credit scene, but this one did, and with just a few hours away from spiderman, it was not worth showing, it should have been shared at the end of the original cut like with all the other marvel films. I saw the original on the opening night and a few times after and scored the film 8 out of 10. But this score of 5 is because the re-release left a bitter taste from a money grabbing Disney.",
        "They spent a lot of time in this film trying to tie up loose ends from both the past and present with some fitting scenes relating to previous movies. I loved the film but spent the first hour wondering where it is going, and how long is it going to take to get there. The big battle was both good and bad. It seemed a little messy because they were trying to give each character some on screen action time. The CGI and effects are as always amazing in the MCU films though. Lots of cheering in the cinema and clapping too which was unfortunate as many gags and punch lines got missed. I will see it again so that I can just sit and enjoy the final story but unfortunately I don't think it lived up to the hype.",
        "I will try to not reveal anything about this movie because everything new will amaze you. It takes you well back in time and references other movies that just fit in perfectly. It gives shock and seeing all the characters on screen felt the wait worthwhile. Although this title did had some confusions from previous references, it still worked out. This is a must-see movie and I hope it will be enjoyable for everyone else as well.",
        "With a perfect respect to both death and life, Endgame lived up to the definition of closure. The intricate plot takes you through laughter and tears, joy and grief, anticipation and thrill. The cast and the crew did an incredible job in pulling off the task set before them.",
        "MARVELOUS Nothing short of spectacular. An ensemble of epic proportions. A group of remarkable individuals: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Paul Rudd, Jeremy Renner, Brie Larson, Josh Brolin, Karen Gillian, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Russo Brothers, Kevin Feige and many many more have created the event of a generation that'll be forever celebrated in the halls of great cinema magic.",
        "I'm honestly surprised at the amount of highly rated reviews, this feels like the standard superhero movie with a few little twists. The characters are standard and fine, with the exception of Captain Marvel, who is so perfect that she only fails when the plot tells her to and she has no stake or motivation in the story. The plot is slow, obvious, and kind-of bad honestly, but the action is good, especially the final action scene. It's a fine movie, I like it more than Avengers 2, Thor 1-2, etc. But it's not life changing in any way. Bonus points to Hawkeye for actually being a somewhat good character. 6.5/10",
        "THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE OR BETTER THE BEST MOVIE EVER.I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT AGAIN",
        "Maybe I'm a bit over the whole \"let's get all the superheroes together in one room\" genre.",
        "The best word to describe the film is \"epic\". If you rewind time back to ten years ago and tell me a superhero movie can be this grandiose, this emotional and this impactful I wouldn't believe a word you say. Endgame does everything any Marvel fan could want, it serves as a tearful, emotional goodbye to some of the staples of The Universe and as a wonderful way to look forward to what is yet to come. It serves each and every single character from the past ten years justice and allows all of their personalities to flow out. The amount of work the team has put into this, the respect it has to this wondrous world of imagination is unfathomable to me, and the tribute it pays to past works deserves the utmost respect. This is truly the epitome of modern cinema, it doesn't need a killer plot (which it isn't), it is the fruit of ten years of hard work and pent-up emotion all unleashed in one single blow. Endgame is dare I say the perfect way wrap up phase one of Marvel Cinema, and makes me truly look forward to phase two.",
        "It could be takes the crown of no.1 worldwide. A second chance to make things right.",
        "I have watch endgame 5 times, thanks to A-list. I really enjoy every detail of this movie. To be honest, entire marvel movies more like tv show to me, and this is the season finally, to be accurate far from home is the end of phase 3 but you know what I mean. Don't recommend newbie to watch btw, you will 100% got lost",
        "It was inevitable that Infinity War set up too big a plotline for it to not be somewhat disappointing in the conclusion. Very sentimental (too sentimental?). These will not be popular opinions. Oh well.",
        "This movie is incredible, I watched twice in theatre, This movie helps you to feel, Pain, Anger, Sadness, Happiness. The action scenes were another level even you can't imagine the last fight scenes.\n\nI miss you, Natasha,",
        "This had everything twist drama action and you know it over three hours long",
        "I won't spoil. All those who love that genre should have already seen it. But if you didn't, save some bucks and time.\n\nThere only 1 moment, probably lasting few minutes, where I felt something: I took this as a tribute to Stan Lee and so I increased my final score. That part is touching. Really. For the rest, you may read below. No spoil.\n\nThe most boring yawning film ever. Nothing really happens. It's a movie with no spine no plot and actors act less than mediocrely. Maybe good for children for the presence of animals speaking to humans.",
        "Super good i know i am writing this late but this is soooooo good\n\nThis movie has Trailer Action Emotional\n\nAnd it will stay in everyone's hearts forever \u2764",

        "Ohh God... can't trust to my eyes! MCU directors are fricking genius!!! They gave fans what they want with their option of ending. Real MCU fans'll realize how hard they tried to make a masterpiece!! You'll understand the true power, emotions, feelings of the characters... Be prepared for what you're not expecting! Thank you guys for the greatest job...\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

        "Any marvel fan who was following the MCU knows that this was a climactic finish to an amazing decade of great marvel films! You may be able to watch the movie without knowing the past, but it is way better if you know the background information! If you are a fan of action movies, this is the movie to watch! Have fun watching this instant classic!!!",
        "Everyone who is giving less than 10 is stupid , dum and can't understand this movie",
        "It's time for the MCU to get the recognition it deserves. Endgame is a masterpiece, well written, acted and directed. No need for the Oscars in 2020, just give all the awards to the Avengers cast and crew.",
        "I can't believe how well they did this. My expectations were so high and yet there is nothing I would change about it. Im seriously speechless.",
        "I guess the headline wraps it up - what I feel about the movie, that is. With three hours and a rather good prequel it was expected to see some epic action and showdown between the good and evil characters, but yet we only get some minor action scenes and a heck of a lot of boring dialogues and stuff like that. Where is Superman when you need him? At least that would have made the movie more exciting for me. No, the movie has some moments, but it takes too long to get there, and when we do we only get a tiny bit of the action I was hoping for. Thus, with a rating of 8.8 and a throng og positive reviews I must say the movie was disappointingly bad, though not as bad as I first thought it would be after the first two hours though. If you like long dialogues and conversations between superheroes and fancy waiting for action through an entire movie then surely this is for you. If you're like me and liked Thor 3 best since it had a lot of action, then this will be better to watch on Netflix or something when you're out of options.",
        "Epic I think that's the word because I don't have any word for describing it, it can't be described in a single word This is one of the epic marvel movies",
        "I have Never dreamed of a better ending for this already incredible saga, than this one. Lives up to all the hype and anticipation and finally an ending which improves its predecessors in every way! GO SEE IT!",
        "Avengers: Endgame was the perfect conclusion to the current MCU as we know it. The intricate focus to details that call back to practically all the previous 21 films is genius. There are great laughs, emotional cries and overwhelmingly exciting surprises. To any fan of the MCU that's followed these beloved characters since Day 1, this is everything and more. I loved it.",
        "After watching Infinity War, I could not wait for this one. But as the time passed, I felt that End Game would not surpass Infinity War's awesomeness. But now that I have watched it, my advice to everyone is keep your expectations as high as possible, and still it would surpass all your expectations. It truly justifies all the 22 movies and please watch them all before watching this one. Stay away from spoilers. You will laugh and definitely cry multiple times.",
        "I have never in my entire life experienced such a bunch of feelings like this... I could say it was a tornado of shocks, enthusiasm, laughter, sadness, loss. Marvel had created another life in the true life that we live in. Love you 3000.",
        "I cannot believe that I have watched a 3 hour boring movie hoping that at sometime from the beginning it was going to get more interesting and action packed !!",
        "To begin with, it was a good film, decent acting, great effects, a lot of funny parts where whole cinema laughts, but to get a 9/10 or even higher rating movie must have much much better than that, so probably only comics fan boys can rate it higher. The truth is that movie was too long, last hour or at least half hour of the movie was a waste of time, its sci fi, not documentary movie, we dont need to see how they live happy ever after, also despite good fulfillment, you have to say that scenario is what, time machine scenario is the easiest one to extract more money, but the movie leaves the feeling that it is not the true ending. Also the biggest lie is that someone wants to watch it second or third time, even when watching the first one, last hour you question yourself when it will finnish.",
        "This was an excellent storyline, i did not care for some of the larts in tye series, some which did not make much sense but still not a bad movie to watch.",
        "I think it's great. They should just out Captain Marvel more action scenes. Ant man was my Favorite all time.",
        "(Non spoiler review) I really love how this film starts slow and ends really fast. It is a epic end to a amazing series created by marvel,I love how emotional how the superheros seem to be after knowing how infinity war ended. I hope everyone goes to see this film it is a awesome watch and the charcters and action make this a worth while end to the franchise!",
        "One of the most emotional roller coasters! So funny yet so sad truly brought an end to the first decade of the MCU",
        "Kinda feels rushed through the beginning kinda wish the end was cut into one more movie because there is so much they could have done. But im pleased regardless",
        "A great conclusion to the avengers movies. One of marvels best",
        "Thought it was solid. Everything was intense as hell until that gay ass \"girl power\" scene during the final battle.",
        "Very cool movie! very emotional and beautiful film!",
        "Endgame nicely sums up all the previous films to give a satisfying end to a wonderful saga of movies. Couldn't asked for any more. Thank you Russos and all the production team and cast.",
        "THERE ARE NO WORDS. NO WORDS AT ALL HOW TRULY SATISFYING & BITTERSWEET THIS FILM IS!!!! Everything, I mean everything exceeded my expectations from beginning to end.\n\nIts the Return Of The Jedi, Return Of The King and The Undiscovered Country of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n10/10!",
        "Honestly, no MCU movie has got me so emotionally involved in it's story and Endgame does just that. Not only do I get my CGI epic fight scene fix, I also felt closure with the first 6 avengers this is truly a masterpiece and a Must Watch for any movie buff, casual and child.",
        "There were elements where this film moved a bit slower than it maybe should have, but in a way, it helped you take a deep breath before you headed into the storm that was the final few scenes. I laughed, I cried, and then I cried some more before saying goodbye to some of the characters who had been with me for over ten years. All I can say is thank you to these wonderful movies for being everything they were and everything they will always be.",
        "Well it is quite obvious that avengers lovers are going to be sad about the ending..I appreciated the movie but I think that there could have been a better ending. Characters like Thor and captain Marvel have had less importance in the ending. It would have been better if Thor would have possessed an ultimate power,with his 2 hammers. which could kill Thanos Or, Captain Marvel and Thor could have battled Thanos. Iron man and the other avengers could have then joined hands to exterminate Thanos and destroy the infinity stones once and for all",
        "For me Endgame was emotional saga and the journey of our generation came to and end and yes it was not action packed as Infinity War but I feel every violence comes to and end with piece and the ENDGAME could not have better journey then to have established the storyline the way they did.",
        "High hopes for this one but a bit of a let down Im sorry to say.",
        "3 hours went by in a flash! What an epic film. Hope it breaks all box office records and please let it be the first superhero movie to win an Oscar. It deserves it!",
        "This isn't just hype! This movie proved everything is possible. The Russo's Brothers did an astonishing work closing this 10 year saga, and it couldn't be more perfect than this. They and Marvel knew they couldn't screw this up, and Oh My... This is everything a fan of this saga can hope for and so much more. I still have no words that can describe this movie more than incredible, astonishing, incredible, perfect. This is the finale we needed and they sure delivered. It comes full circle, and that's what makes it even more touching and so real in so many ways, it's a superhero movie, yet the way it's so grounded is unbelievable. A closure that not every movie/writer/producer can pull of.",
        "Great and captivating story. Movie ended on a sad note but nothing short of expectation",
        "If Infinity War was Back to the Future 1, Endgame is its 2nd and 3rd part. We get the same battle in a different time, previous scenes from previous movies, same scenes with different outcomes and a lot of satisfactory conclusions for the characters. It's not the same streamlined adventure the first movie was, but this will go down as the biggest obstacle our heroes ever overcame and that's what you will remember in time.",
        "This is the best movie ever that i had seen.Must watch in theatre. Best experience ever. It's perfect , heart touching, etc (I can't write my expressions in words) #Dontspoilendgame #whatever it takes",
        "Movie throughout was a bunch of thrill... Every 10 min from starting have something new.... Though I won't spoil anything.. Thus didn't like Thor's condition... And yes movie has a quite emotional ending... Have been watching all movie. Since 2008.. it was heartaching.. that my childhood favorite characters... Will not be there on screen... No Thor, no cap, no iron man, no black widow, no Hulk ..... Very emotional moment for me.. But hats off to everyone...",
        "The movie was good but I think the 9 rating is to high... It was very predictable.. And I believe many other MCU movies had A better story Don't give me wrong it's a great movie and fun to watch.. Just not a 9 er rating And it has many not awnsered questions and things that makes no sense.. Infinity war was much better...",
        "I just loved it.... absolutely! A walk down memory lane in the best of ways... that 3 hours went like a \"snap of the fingers\"... there were tears and there were cheers and then there was finality!!! Goodbye to The Avengers as we knew them... and loved them",
        "I'm speechless. This masterpiece rewards you for your waiting. Absolute perfection. I have nothing to say yet I want to say everything. I cried like a little girl, i laughed, I screamed. This movie makes everything worth fighting even when there's no hope left. Thank you Marvel, thank you.\n\n3000/10",
        "Predictable plot. Predictable outcome. A few plotholes and convenience plot device here and there. Awesome last fight though, especially involving Cap. Probably made some goosebumps. (it didn't to me, though)\n\nThe film tries to invoke emotions from the audience, but when it tries it too much, somehow it soften the blow, even when it involves characters you care about. However, this is definitely the way if wanna close out some chapters of a character. Build them up slowly and then go for the payoff. Not do it in 2 films.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's a typical Marvel film. It's definitely a love letter to the fans who have been watching since Ironman 1 came out. But having said that, they probably will never reach the heights of these past few films have achieved. Probably.",
        "First two hours was hilarious and the best Climax of the world cinema. Russo bros nailed it. It doesn't felt like 3 hrs movie. Undoubtedly best of MCU.",
        "The film claimed to be super duper buster blockbuster hit after the movie Infinity War, and kept that promise also. Some Critics and Peoples said that the Movie is Overrated, but I can say clearly that they will definitely be DCEU fans who are saying like that for Endgame. They are just trying to undercast the grossing collection of worldwide. Anyway, The movie is for those people who saw MCU last 22 films and awaited for the conclusion as the twist was Thanos in their every movie. Feeling Sad for RDJ... \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
        "This movie is great, emotional, epic with lots of great moments and the ending of the movie is the best and when the movie ends, there is going to be a smile on your face with lots of tears on your eyes. The only people who say this movie is bad are only toxic dc fans and the ones who don't know what is cinema. Endgame absolutely is the best marvel and the best comic book movie have ever made.",
        "Wow! At the end of this movie I just didn't know how to process what I had just seen - it was that good. For the last five years Winter Soldier had been my favourite MCU movie - today that changed. It is a rare occasion that I give a movie a 10/10 but this movie just blew me away and I felt many emotions throughout it. If you're a fan of the MCU go see it ASAP before it gets spoiled for you. For those trolls giving it a 1/10 - come on, you're either a DC troll (you can like both Marvel and DC) or someone with no soul.",
        "Go to the movies and watch, the best movie of the all time marvel, an incredible way to end this saga.",
        "Thanx Marvel for doing such art and make it exists.",
        "This a generational wonder and kids will never understand in coming years how much this meant.",
        "This was a solid movie, with my only complaint being the pacing during an important focal point. While the movie was three hours long, it felt like it needed to be four to tell the complete narrative. However, it was a good story that brings the entirety of the MCU to an interesting point.\n\nWell done.\n\nReal Score: 7.9",
        "This movie plays with your emotions if you have been keeping track with the MCU. If you haven't, don't watch this movie. This movie isn't for you. But if you have, this movie will blow your mind. It's epic, it's big and a feast to your eyes. It's not one of your typical comicbook movies. It has real stakes and the visuals are stunning. It has flaws of course, like some characters could've been handled better. But I think it's one of the best comicbook movies ever. The visuals, the storytelling, the stakes, the characters, it's just amazing.",
        "This movie is a trash movie. It sucks Don't waste your time.",
        "Great movie with great performance,story and amazing screenplay. And lengendry climax scene\"AVENGERS ASSEMBLE\"",
        "Avengers Endgame was heart wrenchingly awesome yet very fitting, thanks to Marvel Studios for the last 10 years of fantastic films. A fitting End to 10 years of the MCU Universe.",
        "I am 9 yeer ol'd my mum toom me to seerhis in the cinema on opening day and it was LIT. thanos is truly an avengers levl threat. i enjoyed every hour of this mastrpeece. would reccomend to anyboty. it was so epic.",
        "This film has brought a lot of attention to the marvel cinematic universe even for those who dont particularly watch marvel are going to the cinema to see this film. It amazes audiences with every minute of the film. This is not a film you wanna miss.",
        "Endgame is everything a grand finale should be. It's an epic drama that takes place in different time periods, involves multiple plot lines from other films, and neatly, and (believably) wraps up many unresolved issues. At 3hrs in length, there are occasional slow spots, but this is forgivable given the emotional depth of the subject matter here. (I wouldn't take young kids with short attention spans.) As expected, however... It also holds you in suspense, excites, and even makes you laugh, though not quite as often as previous Marvel outings... This one leans toward the dramatic. Rest assured, you'll leave satisfied, and maybe teary-eyed... Easily the best of the bunch, and obviously a labor of love for all involved. (Reviewer is 50)",
        "Amazing movie, satisfies every question possible! It made me cry \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25 10/10",
        "The movie was awesome. The battle and sacrifices with the twists that I definitely didn't expect. By far it was amazing to watch.",
        "Endgame is one of those movies that comes out once a decade. It is a must see movie but if you are new to the MCU then you might want to catch up before attending this movie. Otherwise it won't be worth the ticket to see this movie because you won't understand any of it. At the same time the visual effects and master cinematography is worth the watch even if you don't understand anything that is happening. That is why I am giving it a 8/10 because the story is good but there are many other stories within the MCU itself. Overall, it was a solid movie that appeals to fans but if you aren't a fan who has seen all the other movies there might be parts that will be lost on you.",
        "Avengers end game was like a thanks giving turkey, the movie statisfy all of the movie fans like what kind of thing will people see and enjoy those elements were present in this movie in a tremendous manner.\n\nI like most is this has lots of other things than the fight sequence, when putting all the super heroes one place most probably there will always we lots of fights sequences but in this movie we have everything that's the special",
        "The plot hole bothers me so much, and the last year is better than this one",
        "Brilliant Superb . Unreal Electric Emotional\n\nThe movie had it all",
        "Thank you everyone that played a role in this movie production! The best in our time! #WhateverItTakes",
        "This movie coud be shorter on some parts at a begining and give us more of these awsome fight scenes. At first i was woried that it could be boring, but after some time to me it was realy great!! And ended so much beter than i expected!! I loved it :)",
        "From the opener scene to the final fade to black this is an outstanding way to end the journey - so far - of the Avengers.\n\nFunny, brutal, emotional and thought provoking this has been crafted together by people who really care about the fates of these characters.\n\nAbsolutely awesome",
        "I won't spoil the movie but here's what it is in short.\n\nIt's not extremely action packed but it does have an amazing fight. It's logic is inconsistent at times and it's kind of irritating. Don't inflate your expectations for this film because you won't walk away satisfied.",
        "Very good movie. Kind of goofie with the time travel stuff. The cringe worthy segments I had heard about were not that bad, and Captain Marvel did not ruin the movie as feared. Will be seeing this one again.",
        "Just perfect.The storyline is amazing and especially how they connected it with the Infinity War.It creates strong feelings.How the story is evolving with the plot twists and all that makes a perfect development.And of course the effects,the sound e.t.c is awesome too.Definetely a must-watch movie.",
        "Long. Very very long. May have rated it it higher if an hour or so shorter?",
        "You are putting yourself at a disadvantage if you never see this movie. The perfect ending to the perfect franchise.",
        "Makes me cry everytime i see it. Loved every second. I don't understand these other reviews saying they are dissapointed. To me it was perfect",
        "One of the greatest movie of this century. 11 years worth treasure.",
        "Definitely it landed in my best movie lists. It's first time i rated 10 for any movie but this movie brings all. I got no words other than saying that it has all spices which we need. Proper ending like we want to see for our 10 years of waiting. Please run for it, because destiny arrives and it's waiting for you.",
        "Chop this movie in half and it would be a solid 8. This version of the Avengers is painfully long; it would be a thriller like the last installment if it was way shorter.",
        "Movie was everything I wanted and more. Well written story. You feel for the characters. It starts lil slow, but it make sense why. I'll be watching this movie like four times. AMAZING MOVIE!!",
        "No Matter How Great The Ending Is, We all Feel Sad About the Ending..! I was a 9 Year Old Kid when it all Started, Became Huge Fan after Avengers 1, and Now when its all ended i want it to start Over..! Overall Summary of the Movie is that , it was everything you want it to be and way above than our Expectations..! I am Eternally Gratefull for this Journey..!\u2764",
        "Things you never expected take place in the movie, it takes us through a journey of all the characters. There is no such emotion which the movie lacks, right from humour,joy to grief. I'll definitely watch it over and over again. And last but not the least, thank you Avengers.",
        "MCU nails a perfect 10/10 in my opinion. This was awesome... It provides us with humor, little drama, Awesome action sequences, loads of surprises, best storytelling ever, A blast from the past, a perfect well told ending, a satisfying conclusion. I honestly can't wait for the Next 20+ Marvel Should have All 100% creative impute on all Marvel based Movies... They also really love the digitally d-age thingy... I guess make-up to make some one younger isn't cutting it anymore... They pretty much can higher any old actor now because they can digitally d age some one decades younger.... but I'm joking of coarse.",
        "I got forced to watch the midnight release of this with infinity wars on before it and I fell asleep.\n\nSo I finally gave it another go, now I know why I fell asleep. For a non marvel fan (I love guardians and deadpool, that's about it) it really isnt very good except for the SFX (obviously) and the end battle is amazing I have to admit. But that's about it, btw I really enjoyed infinity war, so I was open to it, but besides A funny Thor bits there really isnt much.",
        "Avengers EndGame starts with the aftermaths of Infinity war(that spidy thing really left me emotional).The movie starts off well and after some time it becomes predictable,but comedy fills that void. There are some really hilarious scenes in the movie and you really gonna enjoy them . The entire 2hrs of the movie deals with the Time Heist thing, and the last 1hr is the much awaited combat between avengers and Thanos,the mad titan, which was quite clumsy and not that effective than Infinity war. And I didn't felt any emotion while watching the dying of our favourite avenger and I felt like the movie and the franchise should end in any way , so Russo brothers hurried in making that and it was so clumsy. The final battle VFX were not great for a movie like this. So , finally it ended . And I felt emotional not because of the movie ,but for I'm not going to see these avengers next time. Overall , EndGame is not a bad movie,nor a great. But it's a good movie with some good comedy and drama. (Infinity war stands first)",
        "The Russo brother did it! They gave a majestic conclusion to a tuli marvelous saga. I have never cried so many times in a movie and my body gave me a new \"feeling\": at one very cool moment of the movie my body just... shook. I was amazed of how much they could cover in \"just\" 3 hours and it surely didn't feel that long. Things I wanted to happen, happened better I hoped. I am just very happy for this movie, it is now my favorite movie of all time and I can't wait to see it again!",
        "The haters are still mad over Captain Marvel; Go and enjoy the best Comic Book movie ever made. You will not regret it. I laughed, I cried and I loved this movie.",
        "It's just a masterpiece, everything is looking pretty good!",
        "I laughed, I cried, this is perfection... I'm still totally stunned!",
        "To be honest this movie doesn't look like avenger. Is about family fight together. Talking about family someone should make a movie about thanos life how gamora fin her.",
        "Fitting end. Twists and turns. Best film in have seen for some tome",
        "Deus ex machina? No Deus ex capt. Marvela! I audibly groaned at the A-Force shot because it made no sense in the context of the film, and it's pandering to a tiny minority of the community that mocks these types of movies anyway. It's not just male characters that were trivialized by Miss Marvel. All the organic female heroines were also pacified by Captain Marvel, most of all, Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch. Brie Larson is the toxic element that has contaminated the MCU. She literally ruined exery scene she was in. She is a repulsive human and a horrible ACTRESS! Remove her and get #IdentityPolitics out of the MCU!",
        "Without second thoughts I would say that it wad the most impressive work for Marvel.. makes you feel sad, happy, excited and thrilled to the max all in one movie",
        "This is perhaps one of the biggest movies of all time if not THE biggest film of all time! Avengers endgame is a stunning love letter to fans of the MCU, and will truly leave an impact on the whole movie industry. The movie is just so spectacular that I can't even cover everything with mere words in this review. Infinity War was spectacular but this movie is the one that for the last 12 years has been built up to. There are plenty of Easter eggs and references to the past movies that true fans will understand. The acting is great from all involved and the visuals are incredible. This movie is quite an emotional ride, and it will have you going through a whole range of different emotions and it's 3 hour run time. I can't say enough for this movie, just be prepared for your heart to be racing Non-Stop! I don't want to spoil anything because there is just so much to spoil for those who have not seen it yet. This movie will be talked about for many many years, and there will never be another quite like it.",
        "Loved it so much, just can't see a story with so much depth getting better.",
        "Remember we are at the Endgame now. To be able to conclude all the 21 of interrelated marvel movies in one finale is a feat that took years of planning and perfection. All the movies to reach this epic conclusion is just a scene where you need to know its importance. A true ending that is both heart warming to a great departure of our marvel heroes. Go, watch and experience this masterpiece that will be remembered from years to come!",
        "This film had everything! Action, comedy, stake, emotion, surprises and fan service.\n\nThe film didn't feel like 3 hours either\n\nHard to write much for this without giving anything away!\n\nFully worth a watch! For more impact, watch the others before hand or else you will be confused and there will be bits that won't land or will go over your head",
        "It had everything you could ask for in a movie and more. The only genre it doesn't really touch is romance. It has the drama, the comedy, the action, the clever and often heartwarming dialogue, the personal struggles, the betrayals, fulfilling character archs that make sense (Unlike Game of Thrones), and the perfect ending to an amazing movie journey.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is an apotheosis, full of surprises, but I'll tell nothing, the Marvel policy has to be respected: spoilers are prohibited! What I saw was different from my expectations, but good surprises! The Marvel movies are not just films, they are more than that, but I don't figure out the right word. Avengers: Endgame is an epilogue like nothing similar! Go and watch it!",
        "Incredible movie and an amazing way to wrap up 11 years of great movies! An achievement!",
        "This movie was just perfect. dont listen the others because they're angry that this movie has a high rating on imdb and high score on rotten tomatoes",
        "Bravo. Bravo! Somehow, one of the most hyped movies of this time has exceeded my (and many others') expectation. This movie leaves a beautiful bowtie on top of the gift that was the MCU. Unlike many other superhero universes, the MCU primarily focuses on character development over the abilities or powers of the heroes. This movie is no different. The first time I watched this movie, I was on the edge of my seat, crying, laughing, cheering, and throwing my hands in the air. No other movie has ever brought about this level of emotional response in me. Somehow, I was crying even harder the second time I watched it even though I already knew what happens....",
        "All i wanted from marvel thank you to all cast of endgame you're my true heros \u2665",
        "Everyone must watch It is one of the best movie of this decade Vfx is ultimate",
        "This movie was all and more. It was a long movie but I never got bored. Thought things were gonna go one way and it went totally different. I will say the very end let you know what movies where coming back and hat characters wouldn't be returning. It also lets you wonder if maybe things are how they looked. I want to go see it again",
        "The end that a saga of this magnitude needes! Very nice plot that doesn't let you get bored.",
        "Emotional, epic and memorable character, this story is perfect ending to close The Infinity Saga story. LOVED IT",
        "The movie is great, but not the best marvel movie to date. If you mix Infinity war + the last 1 hour of this movie, you actually get a masterpiece movie (10/10). In the 2 first hours, the movie was slow, and it felt more like a tribute to the 10 years of the marvel universe. I guess they wanted to connect the fans with the older movies. The last hour was excellent, and the action exceeded expectation. Of course, there are some holes in the plot, but Marvel does not let us down. Once again, another movie that Marvel fans won't forget easily.",
        "This is the best movie I have watched till now. I will rate it 10 out of 10. There was so much excitement so much surprise so much action and the last thing which broke heart, emotion. Only the real fan will understand how much it broke heart. But it was needed to get 10 out of 10. As it is spoiler free I can't tell anything more but one thing, I have watched the movie in hall print then think how will it be in 1080p blue-ray. At Iast I wanna say the incredible last sentence \"I am Iron-man.\"\u2764\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc9d\u2764",
        "The action is massive, the cast huge, the scope in size is bigger than ever, but most importantly the emotions are deep and rich. Because of where Infinity war left, we get to see our characters in this world in a very different place and that provides all of our actors to emote in new and deep ways. Beyond that the Russos take certain characters in some bold and new directions and they're still taking risks this late into the game. Where Infinity war spread the spotlight throughout almost the entire MCU, Endgame trims down the cast to primarily just the original Avengers plus some additions, so everyone gets a full charater arc htroughout the entire film. Throughout the story they are able to squeeze in a bunch of plotlines that we've seen throughout the franchise thus far, and it all leads up to the slam-bang finale that somehow manages to top both the airport sequence as well as the battle of Wakanda. And as you move into the last 15 minutes of the film they manage to successfully close out this era of the MCU. In closing you feel satisfied and you think to yourself: This is a pretty MARVELous conclusion.",
        "I have absolutely no words for how good it was. I 10/10 recommend it, it's happy, sad, but satisfying.",

        "I laughed, I cried, I cheered and I said goodbye. An excellent ending to the best universe ever created!",
        "This was a well thought out, superb conclusion for the culmination of 22 movies in 10 years. It is without a doubt the spectacle of of the decade. The movie obviously deals out tons of fans service, but is still one of the best super hero movies to ever be created.",
        "I never have seen any movie in life that has such a great action and awesome fantasy , I am speechless and all I can say is bravo and will done.",
        "Just got back from a matinee of \"Avengers: Endgame\"(2019). In short, a spectacular, satisfying and enjoyable finale to the Marvel Universe movie series. They hit so many \"right\" notes and gave the characters their respect and moments and manage to fit in so much material coherently in one movie. Without giving anything away, the final scene is just so right and the whipped cream and sprinkles on the sundae. My only real gripe? (drum roll), some of the action. That hyper-shot, dizzying camera moves and hyper editing style that I've come to despise in the last 20 years. A big screen Xbox game with a 6 year old at the control, who has ADD! I think some of the action in other Marvel Universe movies was shot and edited better. Having said that, this entry is right at the top of the summit of the super hero genre and should make a quadrillion dollars at the box office.",
        "(Spoiler Free) This movie was absolutely amazing! A great culmination of the last 11 years of the MCU. See it in IMAX if you can.",

        "This movie is almost great all around, with a great story and an ending to some characters that were just perfect. This movie definitely doesn't leave out any loose ends, but it does have a problem. The movie completely destroys the character development of some of its beloved characters i.e.Thor. They completely took away everything people liked about Thor, and made him look less like a god, and more... pathetic to say the least.",
        "Just a lack of any worthwhile creativity is evident all over this film. The writing is trash, infused with stereotypical Marvel humor and even more annoying attempts at trying to drum up tears. The only thing that makes this film worth watching in any way is the acting in some key moments by some of the outrageously paid all-star cast, specifically the performances by Downey Jr and Johansson. I think both of them did particularly well, and I wish the latter was more prominent. Besides that though, there are about 14,000,605 outcomes where this movie is made, and all but one are laced with egregious plot holes and devices. We didn't get that one.",

        "One of my friends recommended this movie for me to watch. So far, this movie is one of the best movies I ever watched in my life. This is inspiring, funny, and not boring. I will recommend you guys to watch this movie. MAke sure to book the ticket before hand if don't want it run out.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is one of my favorite films, the main reason I like this film is the amazing acting of the cast, I also like the scene where the superheroes gather as one and learn to put aside differences to work together to fix the situation because of the enemies of the superheroes. Took half the life on earth\n\nHowever, this film also has its drawbacks where this film does not provide amazing visual effects for a large film scale.",
        "This is the first film I've watched from the marvel franchise, and it's very disappointing. The visuals looked like they were done by a 12 year old (very CGI heavy, as of which was awful) and the plot is far too complicated. It excludes those who haven't watched all the previous films before this one, especially in the time travel scenes, which were arguably the weakest parts of this film. There are also many other scenes that are either too slow, or don't make sense which significantly added to the length of this film. The action scenes saw little improvement - they were drawn out and any individual battles taking place were practically impossible to see. Captain Marvel must be the worst actor I've ever seen, and Spiderman looks like someone they've dragged out of secondary school. The popularity and success of this film is really difficult to justify - perhaps the audience are none the wiser and lack the viewing of good quality films. This is the first film I've seen where it feels refreshing to see the end credits. I would not recommend the marvel franchise, unless you enjoy a good endurance challenge.",
        "Despite its flaws this movie is an amazing ending for the heroes we come to love throughout the last decade. Years of build up leads to an emotional rollercoaster with fan-service done right.",
        "3 hours sitting in movie theatre were definitely worthy. I enjoyed the whole movie and was sad at the same time for saying goodbye to familiar characters.",
        "The Avengers is a cult movie series where we can watch all our childhood heroes in cool costumes and a great cast. The picture looks as bright as possible and because of this you can not take your eyes off the picture.\n\nI love the humor in this series of films. Tony Stark is my favorite character to watch all the time. The plot is very unusual and it is quite difficult to guess the ending. I also want to note the elements of combat in this picture - as usual with the Avengers - this is the highest level. Watch with pleasure.",
        "This is a very well done movie not as good as infinity war but still good, you shouldn't watch if you haven't seen a marvel film before",
        "\"Avengers: endgame\" was supposed to become The great final of the biggest series of Marvel films containing all the main characters.\n\nWhat it really is what we see? I wouldn't name it The great film. Yes, the cast is good and well-known and the picture is fine and beautiful, but it didn't become that great as it supposed to be. The storyline wasn't that different from other films and the end was not such a surprise. So, go and watch it, probably for you it would be The great final.",
        "It was amazing. The hole movie was so good a would watch it again and again. WHAT a experience",
        "The film \"Avengers: Endgame\" not only continues the acclaimed and large-scale film comic Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War, but will also be the end of all the so-called first four \"phases\" of this movie universe. It is assumed that after this picture, the world of Marvel is waiting for a completely new development, and the \"Saga of the Infinity Stones\", which began back in the first Iron Man, will be completed. The new film will also feature Captain Marvel, whose backstory is worth exploring in a solo adventure. Put \"Final\" Avengers brothers Russo. And the music was again composed by Alan Silvestri (First Player Ready, The First Avenger, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb). The flick of the Tanos glove wiped exactly half of the entire universe into dust. Now those members of the Vengeance team who survived must work together to repel the mighty titan. Defeat in battle is not yet a lost war.",
        "The only problem with the movie is that it's too damn good. It'll take a long time to get over the awesomeness of endgame. Just sit back, relax and enjoy a masterpiece by Russo Bros :)",
        "Worth it. 11 years and 21 movies later, the journey was an unforgettable one. The emotions conveyed on my face have not done justice to this epic finale. What are you sitting and reading this for ? Go and watch the zenith of Marvel Comics come to life.",
        "What a remarkable journey it is for Marvel Cinematic Universe. I don't think anything can accomplish this kind of achievement in another franchise universe. This is indeed one of a kind.\n\nTo everyone contributing in the making of this universe, producers, story writers, directors, actors, CGI makers, and everyone involved, from the bottom of my heart, I say thank you very much for the experience, the sensation, the excitement, the wonders you guys brought to the movies..",
        "I had a lot of high expectations, a lot of anticipation, a lot of theories, and I was not let down at all. Yeah, there are some little nitpicks here/there, but honestly, not enough for me to not call it the perfect conclusion of the 21 movies leading up to it. Rest up, bring tissues, and wear a diaper (as Ruffalo instructed so you don't have to leave to pee, lol). Go watch and just enjoy. <3",
        "Truly a celebration of the Marvel fan base and universe. Couldn't have asked for a better wrap-up. I was in tears for all of the third act.",
        "I didn't even realize three hours have passed until the movie ended. Best movie I've ever seen.",
        "So good so good so goodsjhrufisjrhf7diajrfj Djsi4jfi Anfjir",
        "This is the best Marvel movies and the most best movie for me it better than dark knight it should have the most high rating. Everyone Have To Watch It.",
        "Framed in emotions, a farewell to all core charecters. The film strikes through every expectation in terms of storyline, action, visuals and humor. It will give you Goosebumps, it will make you laugh and will emotionally satisfy at the same time. Don't follow these negative reviews...JUST GO AND ENJOY. Its a grand conclusion to 21 epic movies of MCU and things have been placed in the right direction to make it memorable. #Don'tSpoilEndgame",
        "Don't want to spoil the film, but you get the scope of how big the MCU really is. Or was...\n\nMind blown, the mind blown and the, you guessed it, mind blown again. And that's the movie. :)",
        "I've watched close to 10,000 movies in my 28 year lifetime, and this series had me in every emotion in this long journey. From Iron Man 1 to Spiderman Far From Home was just fantastic. Some movies were worse then others but Avengers End Game and Avengers Infinite War were by far the best. Incredible film",
        "Just amazing. To complete a 22 film saga, wow just wow can't do it better then this. My emotions were everywhere. I love you MCU, can't wait for what's next.",
        "I will not spoiled anything from my heart I love 3000",
        "I would remove one star for the attempt of political correctness. I'm not saying the female scene is bad, but the storyline around captain marvel is lowsy and could be better.\n\nOther than that, no complains at all. Very good actors, thanks for your hard work! You deserve every dollar you get from this movie!",
        "This is one of those rare movies that it seems pointless to write a review because its so good. In fact its so good finding something to criticize here will only make you look petty.",
        "Just came back from the movie theater after watching the movie. Not gonna give any spoilers or any kind of stuff that will ruin it for you after reading this. I'm just gonna say if you're a Marvel ultimate fanboy, a regular Marvel viewer, only watched Infinity War because of it's hype or just a normal movie goer that wants to watch an incredible movie it doesn't matter. This is in my opinion the pinnacle of cinema and I don't think I'm ever going to see a movie in the theaters ever again (except this movie again 2-3 more times). Just. Go. See. It.",
        "Couldn't have asked for more from this perfect ending to a truly epic run of movies.\n\nVery sad to see it come to an end after 10 years of absolute blockbusters but they've successfully delivered a satisfying, heartfelt conclusion.\n\nBring on the next phase!",
        "Watched Endgame twice in its two days of release in India. It's an epic and emotional movie showing everything for its perfect conclusion of 11 years. Beyond expectations, this movie will amaze you in every moment. Can't say too much because as a fan, everyone has a lot to say. Love to be a Marvel fan.",
        "I usually hesitate to use words declarative words as best or worst. So this offering by Marvel is somewhere in between the best movie I've ever seen and the worst movie I've ever watched. This being said Endgame felt like the poem \"Casey at the bat\". All full of potential only to strike out.",
        "I am immensely honoured to be existing in this monumental era of time to be able to experience the vast complexity and extravagance of the MCU, as it flourished with each subsequent film. It has been one hell of a ride, but unfortunately - all good things must come to an end... and this film met this end with great success.",
        "Extremely well done. I haven't watched all the others leading up to this one, but seeing Endgame makes me want to in order to appreciate it all the more. As I was watching, I couldn't stop thinking about how massive the budget for this film must have been, and when I looked it up, I was both surprised and unsurprised simultaneously; the investment really shows. Let's hope they'll spend a good chunk of the revenue on raises for their employees now that the film is such a success, but we all know the real odds of that happening.",

        "Great movie that has everything fans want. Great characters, good writing, and amazing wrap up of an epic story. This is no way worthy of a 1 and I'm suspicious of anyone who would rate it that way. A lot went into this movie and the actors, writers, directors, etc deserve much better. It deserved all the success and hype it got!",
        "To all the haters, sit and think about the sheer amount of story, fan service, fun, epicness and sadness that tge managed to pack into 3 hours. The Russo bros had to tie up 22 movies and that is impossible, yet they pretty much pulled it off, anyone who says the price of admission wasn't worth it just for the Captain America scenes alone may as well stop watching movies. This is a tough act to follow, and a far more worthy record holder than the blue alien pocahontas rip off ever was. Keep it up Marvel, we are eagerly waiting for the next 10 years of amazing stories.",
        "It's all about a Marvel movie which takes the same old road to glory: new and old characters all put together, stories that cross one another and turns that we +/- expected. In my humble opinion it doesn't deserve the #5, not even top #100 ...",
        "There are two types of Marvel fans: Those that are true to the cinematic universe, and those that grew up embracing the comic book universe. You'll know who's who by hearing their opinion, or reading their review. To mine, I believe there were far too many opportunities missed where this movie could've leapt to incredible heights.\n\nUnfortunately, the universe and popular comic book story lines were sacrificed to cater for politically correct propaganda. Definitely a missed opportunity, and a sour end to a great run of films (excluding Captain Marvel).",

        "While it took a \"human like\" turn where even characters became like us, it felt like it was a rush to the end and you felt at a loss because Thanos still won",
        "This is the culmination to end all culminations. Just superbly well done and is such a well balanced blend of action, laughs, cries and sensational acting and film making. Stretching the CGI prowess of our time to the limits and concluding a brilliant series of films. I really hope the next series of films do these justice. Without RDJ they will be missing a major part of the exceptional element to these films but hopefully with the talent available a new type of RDJ will appear. I think I'll leave it a few months and then start rewatching them again.",
        "I remember when i watched for the first time this move ,i was so upset after seeing the fat Thor and i considered this movie to be one of the worst movies ever,but last night i saw the movie again (i really don't like the Avengers series,excepting Infinity War ,although i like MCU as a whole ) and suddenly i realised this movie is as good as Spiderman Far From Home .This is really a great movie , hmmm !",
        "I never knew how much a movie could impact me like Avengers Endgame did. Not much words can explain this movie but one can and that one is \"BRILLIANT\"!",
        "If you're going for the Avengers film to expect action, Endgame may disappoint you a bit. It's not as packed with action as some of the other MCU & Avengers movies are. However, it does have a good storyline. It just seems a bit slower in the first half. Now many do say that plot development is crucial too. People need to relate to it emotionally. And that completely valid and I agree with them. However, there are times where the plot development seems way too long winded. Regardless, this was the Finale and it stood up too its expectations. So all in all a great movie!",
        "It's too slow and there's lack of action in the movie, I think they focused more on story line and all , but it's a good movie.",
        "I grew up with these movies and invested my time and money on watching every single marvel movie to this date. And boy they didn't disappoint. Such an amazing (bit heartbreaking) farewell to RDJ and Chris Evans. I hope they'll contribute to explore the stories of Natasha, Thor, Bruce and Clint. Love the movie so much and planning to watch it again soon. The last fight was so epic and had so many iconic moments. I am glad that they brought all major characters to this movie. Truly epic. Waiting to see what they will do after the endgame.",

        "I laughed, I got teary eyed, I cheered, among many feelings. This film was a perfect culmination of the past 10/11 years. With call backs to every MCU movie, with many surprises and moments this film is just as epic as people are hyping it up to be.\n20/10",
        "Endgame - it is here. And it is bigger, stronger and more exciting then ever.\n\nPrepare to get your mind blown and hold on to your seats. This movie is a wild one as you probably expect. You will get a few decent laughs. A dozen of epic sequences and big reveals. That will even shatter the long debates between hardcore what could happen or who can do what.\n\nSome characters will change in unexpected ways and will make you laugh more than you will probably expect.\n\nIt will go for three hours and you will not want it to stop.",
        "\"Yeah I guess you are right : This movie is a total mess with complete insignificant plot. I don't know what happened in the Russo's head while making the scenario. They must have hung their ideas with something like : We must satisfy our fans and give'em everything they've ever dream to see in a super-hero movie. Such an idiot way to think huuh? Seriously this movie sucks, with no emotion, no value. Everyone who liked this movie are complete idiots and should calm down. By the way the CGI is terrible and the acting is weird.\"\n\n-From the biggest random, heartless, no emotion, idiot, unbelievably reckless, completely unattractive, purely uninspiring, poor, ugly, rude, very unpleasant, inhuman, horrible persons in the world.",

        "... so don't.\n\nIt's a time travel jumble that never settles into a solid theory of time, predestination, or the multiverse theory. Or more speficially, it tells you its theory and then spends the next couple of hours breaking it over and over. If you try to work it out, side effects may include headache, nosebleed, and a desire to have a bit of a lie down. That said, it's emotionally perfect as the ending of the whole series thus far. The 22 film + shorts + tv-shows-if-you-like-that-kind-of-thing has a definitive end as well as the promise of a new day just ahead. In the shared-universe age of films, this is the first time I've felt like I was seeing a \"series finale\" the way one would with a long-running TV series. Now to hope that what lies ahead isn't a bunch of films that feel like \"After MASH\", trying to keep the IP alive when all of the interesting characters/actors have shuffled off down the road.",
        "I could not have imagined a better ending and a more befitting climatic scene to what took place. Amazing movie! 10 \ud83c\udf1f s",
        "Every moment in this movie just makes you surprised, laughed, cried and in the end, it still brings to a close of an Era of MCU FILMS. Truly a Marvel movie indeed. P.S The best yet and will probably gonna watch the second time",
        "Robert Downey Jr.....Chris Evans...Paul Rudd and the Chris....great writing. Nostalgic and whimsy. Intense and loving....the Wit and banter make it all worthy. Oscars should be given out...and kudos the writers the artists and all the actors. For a 40 something lady....loved it and most importantly watching it with my son. 5 stars!!!",
        "My biggest problem with this movie is that it focuses so much on Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America. I liked the way Infinity War juggled so many characters, giving them all great moments. The final battle is great, though.",
        "Nothing will prepare you for this movie. Nothing. It's a marvel. Bring tissues.",
        "Alright. It was sort of like Avengers 3 meets Back to the Future. Good action and a nice little conclusion to phase 3 or 4 of the Marvel universe.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is an incredibly epic conclusion to the infinity saga that skillfully ends this era of the MCU whilst also setting up the next. The direction by Joe and Anthony Russo is amazing once again. All the performances are great and Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans are all incredible. The visual effects are incredible. It's surprisingly funny, emotional and extremely well paced with incredible action sequences. Also the third act is truly incredible and the score by Alan Silvestri is easily his best Avengers score.",
        "Hands down, the greatest Marvel movie very made with a fantastic ending to these iconic characters. Absolutely amazing!",
        "Infinity loop. Now back to the past. Its the same. Too much emotional. Too much patriarcal. The women are atrezzo, they only stay in a second plane. Captain Marvel just talk two times. WTF! Disappointing. Meh.",
        "Avengers:Endgame is a superhero film we all yearned for after the Infinity war spectacle and The Dark Knights standard but this film surely was far beyond expectations and was gripping entertaining humorous and emotional. Yes the movie kicks off to a slow start about the Avengers still learning and moving on from their loss but they found a way to reverse the ruins. Thanos the mad titan and the villain again proved to be one of the best villains abd surely some competition for the Avengers. It is a movie which will stun you This movie is a Perfect 10/10",
        "After all the hype I was convinced it couldn't top the last one. I was wrong. Aside from personally not liking the direction they went with one character, I have literally 0 complaints. It's wonderful. Go see it.",
        "The ending for the journey. 2008-2019 Felt like you were living for watching avengers endgame",
        "While not a total disaster it's way below what i'd pay to watch. i'd rank it at 5 wich is right under what i consider worth the time to watch",
        "Needed more Dr. Strange action! Felt like the final fight scene with Thanos could've been choreographed a lot better especially when you have a magic caster who could dish out different spells like Dr. Strange. But alas, he was instead given the duty of holding off the impending doom from crashing down on his team.",
        "Hulk? Barely fought and not even a rematch between him and Thanos The villains? Killed without breaking a sweat even though they were near invincible in Infinity War Thor? As an obese? Nah. Not working. Thanos himself? Just a super villain. You didn't have any sympathy for him as you did in Infinity War. His whole character was gone\n\nLastly, much of the humor was low-grade.. infinity war is by far the best og the 4 movies",
        "This is gonna go down as one of the best movies of all times, definitely the best movie of the year. Truly epic, funny, happy, fulfilling but sad and heartbreaking",
        "I saw it in theaters with my kid. We were both laughing and crying on the edge of our seat.",
        "Truly fascinating. A fitting conclusion that lives up to the hype.",
        "Character depth, emotion, action, more than apt sequel for MCU movies. The war sequence climax is the one you should expect the most.",
        "What a way to end 10 years of marvel! Prepare yourself.",
        "Fantastic, amazing, impressive, visually stunning, amazing humor, extraordinary visual effects, climax was just awesome \ud83d\ude0e, Chris Hemsworth performance was just a really good, Mark Ruffelo always makes me happy as a Hulk, Robert Downey Jr was a great Iron Man in my opinion, Chris Evans takes the majonir is just amazing scene, I'll watched it again and again, and I've never get bored.",
        "It has been a wonderful 3 hour long experience that I'll keep in mind forever",
        "Hate leaving this kind of review for a franchise I Love, but this Marvel movie was so disappointing. It was really slow and the story line was all over the place. It feels as if it was rushed to production in order to keep the Marvel hype going. Could have been so so much better, sad day!",
        "Funny, emotional and immensely satisfying! Great way to draw so many stories to a close. Whether you're a massive marvel fan or a casual movie goer, check this movie out in the big screen and enjoy the awesome experience!",
        "Before watching Endgame, I had doubts it will not be better than Infinity war. but it's not, the movie is tremendously good, emotionally and fantastic. everything from the first moment to the final scene is perfectly made. I wished those 3 hours never end. I enjoyed every single moment of this beautiful saga, Thanks MCU for the amazing dreams that we lived in such fascinating world.",
        "This movie is a Marvel fan's dream. It has action, humor, and so much heart. No spoilers here, but bring lots and lots of tissues. The pacing was good, and I felt captivated the whole time. This movie is crazy good.",
        "I love this movie not just because there are fan service moments, but the writing is woven together from previous Marvel films and this phase of the MCU culminates in grand style. The fan moments are justified then, because of the writing and the story offers balance. There is no shortage of humor, as you would expect; It has become a stapel to have in a Marvel movie. I can connect with the characters (protaganists) who after losing to Thanos in Infinty War must accept that defeat and move on with that sour taste still in their mouths. This is something most of us have more than likely had to deal with at one point or another in their lives: Defeat and how to pick ourselves up after losing. People can say what they want about the different issues and \"plotholes\" but honestly, \"Avengers Endgame\" closes out this phase in the MCU in such an epic way.. It'll be interesting to see how they should attempt to top this!",
        "I wont spoil it but this was the perfect ending to the series. I watched the first Iron Man in theaters and every Marvel movie since then I've watched in theaters. 11 years later and this ending was satisfying and perfect. Me and my husband both cried",
        "Much like I did for Infinity War, I was caught up a little bit on the hype, but mostly I think I prioritized seeing this so that I could browse Reddit again, since so many popular posts are memes from the final two Avengers films. Unsurprisingly perhaps, I found that it was very much the overall picture I found with Infinity War, which is that it is far from perfect, a blockbuster pure and simpl.",
        "It is full of Hype and exciting ,a great ending, you won't regret watching it at all!",
        "Movie night with Iris.\n\nThe Avengers franchise comes to both a rich and mostly satisfying conclusion. This is complex and emotional stuff, but doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nDespite the running time the action felt paired back, and the intimate scenes given equal billing.\n\nThe basic plot is pretty clunky, but the Back to the Future gags acknowledge that. The feminist apologies even clunkier, and too late. However the film delivers spectacle, gags and an intelligent, emotional kick.",
        "It's bold, brilliant, awesome and heartbreaking. This is the best way the Avengers films could have ended, and soo much more. I absolutely love it",
        "The movie wraps up everything perfectly, that was 11 years and 21 movies in the making. It's make you laugh, cry, and every other emotion you can think of. It's an end of a journey that wraps up perfectly.",
        "There is no comparing Endgame with Infinity War. Sure, the CGI holds up well and the flashbacks are nice, but the storyline is just bad. Overly emotional and a halfwitted plot is the signum of the movie. As a fan of the cinematic Avengers I was dissapointed whilst watching and even more so leaving the cinema. Some decisions in the movie would be better undone and I recommend any fan to stop at infinity war, even tho many heroes death it is more honorable than what Endgame holds for them.",
        "This movie is perfect, it perfectly wraps up the avengers storyline..... it didnt feel like a 10/10 at first but thats because i was used to the typical avengers/marvel movie chain of events. but after looking back on it it was PERFECTLY laid out, the majority of the movie lacks action and fight scenes but thats what it's supposed to be like, its the last time we're going to see some of these characters on screen and they deserve a proper send-off...... but once you get to the end of the film......... that fight sequence... OH... MY... GOD",
        "A cinematic masterpiece ,an allrounder.a movie which will be remembered for a very long time.",
        "Infinity war was way better, in my opinion. There was a lot of plot holes in the movie to begin with. They had many cringe bathos moments and they crammed in too much emotional elements just to make the movie a n uplifting finale.",
        "Was everything I expected and more! Awesome movie.",
        "I always liked comic books, but after watching this nonsense I totally give up. Don't waste your time with this and the 7 rating is too much for this.\n\nHey Disney, if you have no plot or story put a flaunting super slender girl in your movies so I can justify my time and money!",
        "I can introduce this movie to one of the best marvelstudios films. This is movie really masterpiece!!! I rated this 10/10!",
        "A true film geared towards fans made by fans this movie is good conclusion to many childhoods and a very amazing conclusion for 11 years of marvel truly spectacular.",
        "Dissapointing and too long...Basically,only the ;last hour was watchable... Previous entries were much better.",
        "This film, to me, is damn near perfect. Yeah it has a few nitpicky things wrong with it, but it's wrapping up twenty-two films!!\n\nYou're not going to see a film of this magnitude again for at least another decade!\n\nIt's sweet, it's funny, it's exciting, and you can't even feel time passing. It's a thrill from beginning to end.",
        "I liked the movie however I think they kinda made the pace really slow, the first Infinity had way more action.\n\nEither way It had an epic ending for our heroes and I think they did a great job with that.",
        "Don't miss this great epic movie. It is full of fun and great battle.",
        "It is so difficult to express what a person that just saw the film feels. Completion, astonishment, wonder, surprise, happiness, sadness are just a few words that come to my mind at the moment that help me describe what I saw. This film has it everything! Plot twists, an amazing storyline, tributes to the past movies, humor, tears and everything you wanted this long-waited Marvel film to have. 3 is just the real number in hours for how long the film is, but in reality when it starts until it finishes, you forget that number completely by how immersive and well made this film is! This is the best film Marvel has made so far and is one unbelievable way to conclude 21 movies and 10 years worth of MCU history. Joe and Anthony Russo, Thank you!",
        "It made laugh it made me cry it made excited. This movie is a true love letter to the fans.They promised and they delivered. This is 11 years in the making, and i have to say it worth the wait ! GO WATCH IT ! ITS EPIC!!",
        "Don't need to say anything else now, do I? A masterpiece.",
        "It's really impressive how this movie pulls events and storylines from Marvel movies from 2012 onwards. That is epic storytelling for sure. Congrats to the writers and Marvel for integrating all the assets in their universe so well.\n\nBut was it well done? Generally, I'd say \"yes\". I think having so many characters involved watered down the movie's intensity and impact. But still, it's an amazing movie for the scope, scale and visuals that were achieved.\n\nIf you get a chance to see it in 3D, do it. Some good effort was spent in making the 3D version extra spectacular and immersive. Either way, if you enjoy Marvel movies, this one's not to be missed.",
        "No spoilers #ThanosDemandsYourSlience OMG OMG. This movie is everything you've been expecting, and everything you haven't. I'm crying. laughing. Shivering. Everything. Omg must watch if ur a MCU fan or a fan of movies in general",
        "A lot of things from comics I thought impossible to see in the big screen, at least in this iteration of these characters came so unexpectedly that anything I want to say about the film can become a spoiler. What can be said is that they took time to set up the emotional core of the film even though story wise it was going all over the place. But everything pays off with the visual spectacle that gives the highest level of fan service. The epic showdown in the last hour was making the crowd crazy in the theatre.",
        "Spoiler free review here.\n\nIf you are invested at all in any of the Marvel characters, than this is a must see. It was a perfect conclusion to the first three phases of the MCU and it makes us wonder where they can go next that'll feel new and fresh. Worth watching, ignore the haters and negative reviews. Sure there are plot holes but we're talking about a universe in which a guy created his own element and an entire country uses a metal as basically magic and says its technology. Every Marvel movie has plot holes, this one is no exception.",
        "If you're reading this, go watch the movie (again).",
        "Man it is too much boring. Infinity war was much better.",
        "The movie makes you laugh, cry, and walk out filling fulfilled. Watching every movie, going on the rollercoaster with them. One that every marvel fan should enjoy!!!!",

        "Yyyeeesssss that's the marvel movie that we need just grat and brilliant!",
        "This gives you a wow factor after 1.6 Billion worldwide is not going to stop Endgame to make a history. I don't know what will be the next Phase but for now GOTG vol.3,DoctorStrange 2,BlackWidow,The Masters of Kum-Fu,Nora is confirmed for Phase 4",
        "Does it entertain from beginning to end? Yes. Does it makes you laugh as much as it makes you cry? Yes. Is the acting top notch? Yes. Are the special effects, score and set-pieces the absolute best modern cinema has to offer? Yes. Is the script an absolute masterpiece that makes justice to every character in it? Yes. Is it the best movie ever made? Yes.",
        "About the highest praise I can give this movie is that it surprised me after twenty one films to set it up. Three hours and you won't want it to end.",
        "I know many DC deek riders will disagree but Endgame is definitely much better than Nolan Trash knight and any other superhero movies. Direction was perfect, A Perfect end, 11 years journey was ended in just 3 hours, Ending 8 minutes was totally unexpected. Every superhero fan should watch this movie actually it's not a superhero movie it will give you some Life lesson. Genius will get this\ud83d\udc4d",
        "To say the least, it brought so many story lines together and had brought the MCU to a rebirth of sorts. Saddening parts like the loss of Tony Stark and the end of Steve Roger's reign as Captain America. 10/10 . ( I would have given it a 12/10 but the scale doesn't go high enough). Amazing, well thought out and emotional movie.",

        "Ok, I have invested time and energy diligently watching (and enjoying) each one of the 21 Marvel Movies that lead to the culmination of the Infinity Stones Saga, over the last 10 years.\n\nThis movie really is the best cinematic experience that I have ever had. It hit every note, never disappointed and when the credits were rolling, I was already planning when to watch it next (in the cinemas), who to bring, etc.\n\nTo all the folk involved in the making of it... Wow! Truly world class \u270a\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
        "Before seeing this movie I was super excited, but a little nervous. I had no idea how they were going to pull off wrapping up a franchise this big, but they nailed it! I don't think they could have done better with this movie. It was thoughtful, every main avenger had an important character arc to wrap up their story and the fan service was done perfectly. This movie made me appreciate some of the other MCU films that I didn't like as much, like Thor the Dark World. I was stunned at some of the little details that they remembered and brought full circle from the other films. All the characters endings made sense and were extremely satisfying. Also, the final battle was by far the best battle I've seen in any superhero movie. This was more than a film, this was an experience. I will never forget seeing this movie for the rest of my life. It's one of my favorite memories. I truly don't think the film industry can ever pull off a feat like this again.",
        "The only complaint about Avengers: Endgame is that it raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it.",
        "Funny, emotional, surprising, and worth the wait. The 3 hours flew by, and i enjoyed every minute of it. More nostalgic than i was expecting, but great nonetheless.",
        "I really wanted it to be good, I really wanted it to be excellent. But it was just slightly above average. It was way too long. I couldn't wait till it was over. I really don't want to give anything away, but I think it's one of those movies if you're watching it on DVD at home, you would have paused it and a lot of times to do other things, like take a nap!",
        "Please, #Academy . Please award the #MCU SOMETHING for the incredible movie feat they just pulled off after 21 films and the concluding #AvengersEndgame Wow. You can read my spoiler-free #moviereview at Movie Review Mom",
        "A film more concerned with making money and it's stars than characters or plot. No surprises and nothing new just lots of flash and really poor dialogue.",
        "Feeling bad for tony though, This was hell of show. Well done marvel\ud83d\udc4d",
        "First of all, the bad reviews must come from big Avatar fans (which btw is amazing too). Even if you are not a comic fan at all it can't be rated as 1... This Movie is in every single point just awesome. The story and the road from the first iron man movie till endgame is perfection. It is more serious than infinity war and more dramatic. And the final battle is just epic and tops even Lord of the Ring Battles. A must see! the most successful movie in history speaks for itself.",
        "\"why is this a good movie?\". In the half of the playtime i was bored and already wondering, that they needed another hour and a half to tell the story behind this. I don' t want to spoiler anything and i'll remain quiet until the movie's airing is completed. But once you have seen it, please try to answer this simple question: \"why was this a good movie to you?\"",
        "A culmination of character arcs, narrative threads, a decade of cinema history, and like so many films in the MCU before, the guiding theme boils down to this: \"Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be; the measure of a person, a hero, is how they succeed at being who they are.\" No doubt, I have my quibbles---\"I am\u00e2\u00a6an Avenger\" would have kept something of the parallelism, but with a deeper sense of growth and better ethics---and some confusion, but at just over three hours long while carrying the weight of so many franchises, that is to be expected. At bottom, having already invested so many hours and years into these characters and these films, these stars and these stories, the mark of success is the emotional resonance and historic importance pushing the possibility of the medium (and its economic footing) forward, not the cinematic flourishes or compelling performances or memorable quips---that the film has a few of those, too, is merely a bonus.",
        "Even better the 2nd time watching this long movie! It has EVERYTHING I ever wanted to see in a super hero flick!!! I did hope that they brought in other existing Marvel characters; but I understand why they decided not to... This flick had all movie genres rolled into one! GENIUS linking all these movies together!!! Definitely a 10 star flick!!!",
        "Though a slow burn, \"Avengers: Endgame\" is a satisfying, heart-wrenching and entertaining end (not really an end) to Marvel's 22-film saga.",
        "There were many theories of how the remaining Avengers will reverse Thanos's snap. But I am pretty sure no one has predicted this is how the endgame would be. It is funny and emotional. This movie is one of a kind just like LOTR, Harry Potter etc. The first phase of the 180 minute long movie is slow and funny and the second phase is fast and funny with a well emotional climax for this long saga. The final battle of Endgame maybe the best battle scenes in cinematic history. The humongous cast did a well job as always and the cinematography is also perfect. Endgame was an once in a lifetime experience to me as I have watched all the 22 films over 11 years. The Avengers will continue, but it will be very hard to put something like these 3 Phases.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is no doubt the best film in the galaxy. Avengers: Endgame is full of action, sadness and also thrill. I sat in a cinema for 3 hours and a half and have never enjoyed 3 hours more. It is so much better than Infinity War and I am going to see it for a second time lol...",
        "I felt like my 10 year relationship had just ended.... but it was good, really good!",
        "Why they didn't include more fighting? 3 hours is too long to a story without a lot ot action scenes in a Superhero's movie",
        "This movie was just perfect. Never been so engaged in any franchise like Marvels. Masterpiece in any superhero franchise !!!",
        "More emotional than infinity war, fight scenes still good though, writing is a little more reliant on plot devices compared to the previous film but they throw in a good amount of comedy",
        "I cried in at least 5 points of the film, some tears of joy and some of sorrow. Seriously go watch it now. Or if you haven't watched the previous 21 MCU films, watch them now and then go watch Endgame. A truly incredible finale.",
        "Woooooooooooooow..... what did I just watched.... I was sad and happy in the same time. I really enjoyed watching it.... EPIC",
        "Avengers Endgame is the best movie ever made. Every second of this movie is fantastic.\n\nSaw it a second time and I noticed so many new things that I did not the first time. This is really the best movie of the year so far and the best movie ever made.",
        "Best movie ever made in this world vs fans are followed marvels this Avengers series every superhero very closely and in endgame we felt it we felt emotions it was just amazing movie I don't think any movie cannabutter like that just love that way to go and yes I miss you Ironman I want you back again",
        "For me Avengers Infinity War was perfect marvel movie. this one was ok, not great not fantastic, it's just ok. it would be great if they didnt force too much comedie into the movie where half of population went missing and it was normal that we have a kind of drama/action movie and not another comdie action (when you see thor and hulk you will know what I'm talking about). it's ok ending. captain marvel arrival feels like GoT night king lifting dead dragon with chains in the middle of nowhere and nothing.\n\nI hope there will be some another edition, where they cut it all stupid, not funny scenes and present real dramatic through whole movie, and not only last half of hour",
        "Movie is perfect, perfect final to infinity saga, thanks marvel",
        "This is a complete film that completes a Phase of 22 films. The Marvel Universe gets a closure to the Infinity Saga. The film couldn't be more better. it is simply flawless . It is an experience. Just go and watch it and enjoy",
        "This is the greatest superhero movie I've seen in years",
        "Get ready yourself more,you are not ready for this ; ! This one is beyond spectacular In all ways !!\n\nMarvellous scripting !! Brilliant direction make this one is fun, emotional and action packed grand enjoyment !!\n\nGlorious achievement by Marvel Studios\n\nYou have to watch it ,I will watch it again and again\n\n#WhateverItTakes",
        "Wraps up about 10 years of movies spectacularly. Great character development, humor, and just enough fan service. People will say the first 2 hrs were slow, but I had no issues with it. Watched it 5x in packed theaters and they are once in a lifetime experience to cheer for these heroes in a crowd.",
        "I'm just a huge fan of MCU and I've watched every marvel movies ever since Ironman till now. About Endgame, I'm so speechless and to be honest no movie can and will not compare Avengers Endgame film. Thank You #stanLee",
        "There's Nothing To Say!\n\nA Satsfying Ending To A Great Saga!\n\nNow To The New Era of Superheroes...\n\nYou Will be Always Rememberd, Stan Lee!\n\nThank You",
        "The plot twists are satisfying and got a roller coaster emotions throughout the movie. The ending is not predictable at all. Now i feel empty after watching this movie. Damn.",
        "The Best movie i have ever seen! at some times i wounder how the director conclude the end but wao! fantastic.",
        "I have never ever cried at a film....... until now. The most incredible and thrilling movie I have encountered. Marvel could not have made this film any better. They captured every moment perfectly. I really can not put into words just how fantastic this film is!",
        "Alot of things could have been done better. The whole film is based on a time-travel idea that Antman came up with and Antman doesn't get enough credit or time in the film. Hawkeye gets more time in the film! Who cares about Hawkeye?! Slow in parts. Reminds me of Avengers Assemble, most of the film is build up to a final, end of film battle. Much preferred Infinity Wars pace, energy and action-packedness. Infinity War made me so excited for Endgame. Endgame made me want to rewatch Infinity War.",
        "Im not gonna spoil this. Full of emotions out there... sacrifice... love ... and action..\u2764",
        "This movie contains everything that a comic based superheros movie must have. It has perfectly timed funny jokes, Jaw dropping action scenes and an unpredictable story with various twists. Also acting of everyone is awesome. If you have seen all the previous marvel movies then you are surely going to love this one, if you haven't watched I recommend you to do so or else you won't understand some important things in this movie.",
        "Is it really over? Still couldn't believe all my super heros are leaving the big screen. At first, I was worried what the script would be like? Three hours movie? It seems long... However, after watching the movie, 3 hours not enough, wish it is longer! Because so many characters and so many stories that need conculsion. It is unbelievable how many great actors/actress are involved in this movie, many of them just appear for a few seconds. There are so many loyal Marvel fans around the world. It is indeed an awesome franchise!",
        "Every character's superpowers are ruined.. too messy for a so called best of the best.. comedies arnt on point..",
        "I liked this and the action it was so much action and I like the captain America part",
        "I watched Endgame in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!\n\nIt may have taken 11 years, 21 films but Endgame finally has shown redemption and smart direction from Joe Russo and Anthony Russo\n\nI want more!",
        "This movie is the apex of cinema for my generation. They give you every emotion possible, love, hate, tension and the balance is just perfect. When you think something will happen you got bamboozled. The characters mix is perfect, soundtrack, action scenes and everything else.",
        "I love it It's a very good movie to watch I'm from Iran and I love thid movie I follow this movie from the first episode of it",
        "Was absolutely painful to watch it second time. Where to start from... Every single character's move, line and story twist-n-turn was annoyingly predictable than ever. So unpleasantly unsurprising. Acting was tagged, a total clich\u00e9. Not a single try or aiming to be more original than the first viewing, means no creativity. The action scenes were less exciting than watching a parody of Swan Lake at the local school. Camera work, if there was anything like \"work\", felt like they have tied up a half broken camera on a limping mule's back, and have left. Editing is most atrocious: shot transitions felt long, even and boring, seems they've forgot to buy themselves a watch. Sequences have lost every meaning in the world they might have had in the first place. The soundtrack couldn't have been more inappropriate and insipid. ..... Expecting to like it? Don't watch it twice. Not even once.",
        "What happened? The first one was so great and this turned into another marvel schlock film\n\nPacing was off. Timetravel leaves huge plot holes. Editing mistakes. CGI weak on some parts. No new music score.\n\nIts like someone did a parody of infinity war",
        "The movie is very slow not much action. all talking, all a bit boring really, NOT AS GOOD AS INFINITY WAR",
        "Best movie I've seen so far. I doubted of thuis movie realiteit could be better than IW, nut iT certainly is. Great movie that I would recomment to everyone!",
        "One of the best told superheroes stories and ends well with a bang. However, we are pleasantly surprised with all the twists and turns during the movie.\n\nRetaliation ? Unexpected heros helps our heroes first...\n\nRedemption ? Well, if we can turn back time in the past events...\n\nSacrifice ? Yes, there is...\n\nBut see the movie. Don't spoil the ENDGAME !",
        "I love this movie by the script by actress performances i follow the all avengers movie this movie is final movie with main avengers but i always remember my favorite main avengers and i am dam shore this movie break all Hollywood and Bollywood or any other film industry record love you my five main avengers i always remember you \ud83d\ude4f\u2764",
        "This movie definitely does not deserve a better rating than Avengers 2012. Endgame is just too self indulgent and cutesy at times. Don't get me wrong, most series would have suffered much worse artistically under the weight of success, it's just not better than the original. At all.",
        "It could have been better made movie as a special ending to 12 years of MCU series. Poorly scripted storyline with wasted screen time on unwanted characters.",
        "I watched it. It's boring and tedious. It's slow. It wastes a lot of time with nothing. My favorites are not given much to do. It just seems like three hours I wish I had back. The plot is a ridiculous contrivance. The pacing is leaden. The actors look like they're through with it and glad to be done (Chris Hemsworth excepted). The characters seem less animated and ridiculous than I remember them being (in most Avenger films, there seemed to be a sort of shared agreement that this was all in fun, and, after all, shouldn't it be, it's just a movie. In contrast these seems to want to be more, but more what ... it never seemed comfortable.) A movie like this is supposed to leave you invigorated and \"Wow! That was fun!\" Three hours and one minute is too long for this kind of movie.",
        "So I had to create a word, TerrEpicullous. It bring closure while raising new questions. It's the justice all the fans needed and deserved. I hope they teach these phases in schools.",
        "Beautiful everything, watch it. Its speak better for it selves than any critic can ever do",
        "This movie sucked. All they did was flashback to the other movies when you think about it. But everybody loves it. I didn't realize it was going to be a time travel movie like x men which was garbage too. All this was is to reboot some of the characters. Ok maybe most of them. I'm glad I only paid 5 dollars to get in to see it.",
        "This film is a beautiful piece of work this review will not contain spoilers all I want to say is watch this film \ud83d\ude30",
        "I'm highly disappointed about end of the saga. This movie and infinity war you can't conmpare them . I really like infinity war, but 3 hours of mess right now . you probably watch the movie but you should make your expectings very very less.",
        "Amazing & shocking. I'm so proud with Russo's jobs",
        "Endgame is the ultimatest MCU Movie i've ever seen. Love it. Awesome.",
        "An epic end to the this Infinity Saga..It couldn't have been any better..To all those fans around the globe who have been waiting for this moment. I have to say this is worth Ur wait, this is the moment, this is the Endgame",
        "Super anna tq so much This is the best movie in Marvel",
        "Avengers endgame is kind of a \"sweet gift\" from marvel studios to all marvel fans around the world who have been faithful in terms of following the franchise since it was released first on 2008.\n\n10 years of workhard, never dissapointing. Avengers endgame is a kind of a \"indirect communication\" between the director and the fans, on how thankful they are for having them.\n\nAvengers endgame, undoubtly, is a work made by heart.",
        "No other words need be spoken. No idea when/if we will see another build up of this caliber.",
        "I think this is the conclusion of a decade of phenomenal MCU movies. I feel sense of emotion and pride after watching this movie. All scenes are important and I think I have to watch this movie at least three times. \ud83d\ude0a. I am curious about the MCU next phase.",
        "Like much of other series , avengers gets worse with the end. Honestly, to my opinion not worth to go to cinema. Infinity wars was much better. I was expecting a great ending, not this.",
        "Fun movie to watch and interesting twist of characters they did with Thor and Hulk. But not worthy of 9/10 ... It's just a fictional superhero movie.",
        "I enjoyed every moment, but I have to say that infinity war was a little better.\n\nI have objections here and there but the great action and comedy makes up for it..\n\nOverall It's a fully satisfactory conclusion.. 3 hours well spent..",
        "This is by far one of the greatest cinematic events in history. This film was just a pure masterpiece. To be honest, the beginning was pretty slow, but after an hour and a half, the movie got epic. What a way to conclude the story of marvel's most beloved heroes.",
        "I laughed, cried and loved every moment and act 3 is the definition of fan service, must see film, best film of the year or of all time",
        "This is the finale the marvel cinematic universe deserves and it is a masterpiece. It surpasses your expectations no matter how high they are. The way they put together everything in place, the comedy, the drama ,the action, everything on point. Thanos - The most badass villain in the history of cinema. The Final act - Perfection. The directors could not have done it better even if they wanted too. Watching it once is not enough.",
        "I really enjoyed this movie. Not only did this movie have great actors.. very good story line and I love the way they throw in some comedy too. Enjoyable and entertaining.",
        "Well, the magnificent saga ends with a such great and satisfying conclusion which gives you the best cinematic experience of your life. Unexpected, brilliant and an all together masterpiece.",
        "So, I have been going to all the Marvel movies since I was 8 years old when the first Iron Man came out. Since then it's been a part of my life that when Marvel would drop a new movie I'd be going whether that meant going with my brother or with friends. I always really took those movies and it's characters for granted. And I have to say, I couldn't ask for them to wrap up the Avengers saga in a better more emotional or entertaining way. I have never cried in a Marvel movie before, but this movie shed tears at least twice for me. For me this was a combination of the film's excellence and the sadness I faced seeing such a big part of my childhood come to a wrap. If you grew up with the Avengers like I did I have a feeling you'll feel the same, and even if you're not a hardcore fan, it makes a really fun and thrilling watch even with its 3 hour runtime.",
        "I'm from Iran and unfortunately due to the sanctions, no theater screens avengers endgame here.so i had to watch it in hdcam. But when i did, it didn't feel bad and i really enjoyed the quality of the movie. But about the film it self: first of all, this film will make you cry and it will break and heal your heart at the same time. It will do it so beautifully that you will never forget it. I watched the endgame 3 times in a row today and honestly I think I'll watch it again. I enjoined Every second of the movie. Thank you marvel, god bless you.",
        "This movie blew me away. It kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was slow where it needed to be and fast where it needed to be. I am glad they decided to keep the run time at 3 hours, it needed it. And on run time, it flew by. There was a fair big chunk of the movie that was \"slowish\" but I do not say that in a negative way. With how infinity war left off, it had to be. The story was so good and wrapped up nicely. It was respectful to the characters and I am happy where they all ended up, as hard as it was to watch, it was still satisfying. I would be completely satisfied if this was the end of the MCU altogether, it was just so tastefully done. I need to see this again!",
        "This movie is literally perfect, from the soundtrack to the editing, the acting especially, everything is amazing. I honestly didn't know I could love a movie so much! I cried at least twice, and it has the best fight scene in marvel history. No spoilers, but the ending will leave you feeling satisfied, like you've just watched the end of an era. Truly a fantastic era. Thank you Stan.",
        "I Just expected better than that, some shots are rather poor I was waiting for a breathtaking movie, but I didn't get.. anyway, still nice movie",
        "The most impactful movie in the entire MCU! Going to see it again and will be just as amazing as watching it the first time. It's a tear jerker for sure but plenty of humorous scenes that don't dilute the serious ones. Thank you Marvel and Disney!",
        "I've just got back from watching Endgame at a UK midnight release and I'm lost for words. This film had me laughing in hysterics and put a huge grin across my face during some unbelievable scenes. It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and made my spine tingle and then also left me in an emotional wreck. No one will be ready for what they're about to see but what a ride it was, it's up there with Infinity War, if not better as it completes the whole 22 film Infinity Saga. The Russos are amazing, everyone of their MCU films are pretty much flawless, fantastic job guys.... WE'RE IN THE ENDGAME NOW!!!!",
        "This is simply the greatest super-heroe movie that I watched, have everything that a geek needed, its a huge tribute about everything that MCU represents, its shocking how they got all the events get work in 3 hours (and I have to say that don't look soo long), it's very emotional, beauty photography, and amazing visual effects! The plot it's impeccable, the action it's incredible, it's a big war and I just screamed out loud and vibrated with many moments that I just didn't wait, in fact you can perceive that it is the end, and I cry very bad, and still i'm crying remembering every things. This is it, Marvel got it again.",
        "This is not at all a perfect movie. It has way too many plot holes and unanswered questions. But you can't deny that something like this has never been done in history, like having a 22 movie franchise within a span of 11 years, all interconnected and hitting the right emotions. For the people complaining about character development, you had almost spent 10 years with these characters. This is not a standalone movie and should not be seen as one. It is not meant for critis or awards, It is meant for fans. Not just movie fans but mainly Comic book fans. People complaining about hulk and in this movie should know that there are more than one green raging hulk in the comics and you are not less worthy of anything and thor showed that you are not less worthy even if you are internally broken and don't need to have a body like The Rock to be a superhero. I don't believe that it's a theme park, but I respect your opinion if you do.",
        "If you a mcu fan than it should be your best movie or not than u r not a mcu fan",
        "Totally disappointed... infinity war must have taken the last bit of creativity... this movie was a complete let down and I'm almost disappointed I didn't just wait for it to come out on dvd.",
        "Best Superhero Movie Ever You Will Cry, Laugh, And In The End Of The Movie You Will Be Shocked.\n\nYou Must Watch It",
        "It had everything I wanted to see. Everything. So amazing.",
        "For some reasons I didnt find it as good as its predecessor. Story was average ,at some point it felt it is not moving at all. Linking movie with the pre sequels is very bad specially for those who are watching Marvel movie for the first time. Acting is by far the best from all the characters and bringing back all the characters together in one movie was a great task by Marvel Universe. All in all this movie is not for non-marvel fan. If you have been an ardent fan of Marvel Universe ,this sure will be a joy ride.",
        "This movie is one of the best I've ever seen about superheroes, it has very good action scenes and interesting drama, with very good special effects, I liked the way they revive the superheroes who died in the first part Avengers Infinity War, It's great how they bring the original team together to take a trip back in time and collect the gems. I highly recommend this movie if you like super heroes.",
        "Honestly, I like this movie at first-half. But at the middle, I got bored and I play my phone at cinemas (I sit at the top, and my phone brightness is very low, so I'll not disturbing everyone watching it). When it start to the climax of the story, I got hyped and wow, I REALLY LOVE all the superheroes coming and fights the purple guy (I know its Thanos). But, I'm sure, the ending is perfect to end the Avenger series. Recommend 10/10. But storyline 9/10.",
        "The Russo brothers' poignant, powerful finale more than lives up to the hype: It's a thrilling conclusion and a deeply emotional exploration of loss and love, duty and honor, friendship and family.",
        "Emotional, Impactful, Heartbreaking, Action-Packed, and Hilarious. Endgame is truly the culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's 22 film \"Infinity Saga\" and pulls out all the stops for this film, wrapping everything up in a tight bow that feels as beautiful as it is entertaining.",
        "Best film i've seen, seamless and perfect ending puzzle piece to an incredible series",
        "A good movie with not much to go looking for. Great special effects. Great acting. Bad scripting.(both the story and dialogues) Amazing screenplay and editing. Had higher expectations",
        "Best movie of the world. End of an era. Once in a lifetime experience.",
        "I love this film.\n\nBest film Oscar winning film Love it Best So good.",
        "It only felt like they're trying to fill the gap of the story after infinity war, but this film felt kinda soulless and the jokes weren't as funny as usual MCU films.There were lots of plothole and the writing was also far from perfect, this movie could have been way better than it is if they had taken more time and effort making this.",
        "It's 10 years of beautiful moments and memories marvel brings to us. Movie is full of emotional moments. Anyway, it's beyond \"film\" it's just life itself.",
        "This movie is a complete masterpiece! It is excellently acted, directed, and animated. It is an amazing payoff of all the previous marvel movies coming together.",
        "This movie was everything. Many people don't understand when you're invested into fictitious characters so much but the writers clearly do. They wrote the characters in such a human way it's amazing. Even the godly characters suddenly felt vulnerable. In all honesty, I cried like a b*tch I mean waileddd. Numerous trolls popped up in the internet and declared their hate of the movie but they're obviously trying to seek other people's attention and have that one minute fame thing. But after every negative comment I want you to think of this: this movie took character development to a whole new level, it took shock factor to a whole new level. It's been hours since I watched this movie yet I am still in shock and tears. The fact that a film can have this much effect on someone is crazy ,yet, it does. This is because the way they portrayed the characters is so phenomenal that one can't help but completely fall in love with them. If you are like me and you love these characters then I suggest you take a box of tissues with you. I have never been this saddened by a movie scene.",
        "I know I gave it a 9/10 but there's a reason for that there are 2 epic scenes in this film that deserve the 9/10 rating, but the movie overall was 7/10 maybe a little lower 6.9/10, I just expected more, this morning or started great and surprising, but then the middle was lost and messy to say the least the ending was epic though,",
        "This was a very well written movie. I had my own theory on what I thought was going to happen but was proven wrong. It's definitely an emotional rollercoaster. Enjoy!",
        "What an absolute emotional rollercoaster! There was never a dull moment and it was a 3 hour movie! Every character played their part and it came together beautifully! The fight scenes and graphics were incredible! What a great way to end it really.\n\nThe only little things that irritated me was that I was hoping the 'full' Hulk came to play as he is a lot more powerful than they portray him in the Marvel movies. Also... Captain Marvel comes across very arrogant and smug like 'yes we know... you are super powerful and you know it'. I know Iron Man is very arrogant as well but he makes it into a positive as its funny and likeable!\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and for all of you that haven't seen it yet... get the tissues ready!",
        "Much like I did for Infinity War, I was caught up a little bit on the hype, but mostly I think I prioritized seeing this so that I could browse Reddit again, since so many popular posts are memes from the final two Avengers films. Unsurprisingly perhaps, I found that it was very much the overall picture I found with Infinity War, which is that it is far from perfect, a blockbuster pure and simple, but that it is quite a piece of work in terms of how well put together it all is.",
        "Why don't I give this a ten? Simple everything about this movie is perfect except that nobody says Excelsior or that it doesn't say Rip Stan Lee or something. They should have done something in honour of him. But apart from that this is just pure art",
        "Not my favorite Spider-Man movie but definitely not the worst. I would say Spider-Man 2 was the worst instalment. Go see this if you have a chance!",
        "Is it epic? quite so. Is it fun to watch? quite so. Is it everything you'd expect this type of movie to be? Sorta, I guess? Will it make you laugh? Meh Will it make you shed a tear? Potentially.",
        "Endgame is a repeat of infinity war watered down with fan service, telling you instead of showing you, colorful cgi, member berries, and shock value. This movie pales in comparison to infinity war, especially when you watch it again after the shock and awe of seeing it in the theatres has gone away. A four as opposed to a one or two only because at the start there's some good dialogue and the fan service gets it some points, but you still have to acknowledge that it is fan service as opposed to good writing.",
        "As the conclusion of the current MCU, it does a great job. Everything ties together well. Wouldn't be surprised if they had this whole movie script all but finalized 10 years ago. Even opened a few new possibilities of future story lines. Mildly disappointed with how Captain Marvel was utilised.\n\nAside from the MCU stuff; as an actual movie, I had far too many problems with it. From certain fight sequences, to one dimensional characters, to forced diversity, to pacing issues.\n\nTL;DR Great MCU conclusion, decent movie",
        "I am reviewing this movie in 2021 and it is so entertaining and perfectly planned that it can be enjoyed many times than once with a perfect ending and so many amazing heroes...just wow!!",
        "So I've never written a review before but thought this deserved it. Before watching this I found myself wondering how this movie would play out, how it would all work. Let me tell you, it all worked and in a way I never imagined it would. The story was just so perfect. It had everything, from laughter to sadness and pure awe inspiring satisfaction. The ending was probably perfect. I was literally sitting in my seat with my mouth open from amazement from what I was watching. I truly believe this movie deserves an Oscar for best picture.",
        "After decades of mind-bending world-building and insane twists, we finally have the perfect conclusions ever possible. Each second of this film was a phenomenon of breathtaking beauty and emotional journey.",
        "I could write a book about the emotional roller coaster I've been on this last decade. As a lifelong MCU fanatic, I can say I am beyond happy with how this journey started, progressed, and ended. Endgame was the perfect ending to this saga. As a 25 year old, I will probably never witness a cinematic adventure at such a scale ever again in my lifetime. All things considered, and without exaggeration, I can say this movie, after seeing all the MCU movies before it, is the greatest entertainment experience I have ever had.",
        "This movie was something more than just a superhero movie. In this movie we watch the will of superheroes after been defeated by Mad Titan Thanos. This movie portrays the best 11 years of the franchise in perfect way. Please watch this movie as soon as possible.",
        "The best movies till now. common how many worlds I have to write?",
        "The movie wraps up the series nicely, but as with many finales the movie doesn't really stand in it's own until half way through.\n\nThe first half is wrapping up all that happened before, and a lot has happened to so many different strong and complex characters. The hour and a half it takes to reach the real 'end game' feels both a bit shallow, and slow.\n\nAll in all, the movie does what it promises, end the series, but for those who are not die hard fans, might find the end result a bit uninspired and dutiful.",
        "This movie is perfection in modern cinema, great ending and gives great closure for the franchise.",
        "First of all, the action in this movie is the best I've seen in any Marvel movie. It beats out some iconic scenes trust me. All the actors in this film did amazing jobs. From when we first see them to now you can see the character growth that has developed in them. This film is three-hours-and-two-minutes long but really you never feel it. You're so engaged in this movie and the characters that the time just flies by so quickly and every second in this film is important. I feel like if they got rid of anything in this film it would take away from something. That something being the emotion in this film. There is so much emotion in this film that even one scene being removed would've ruined it. In the end, Avengers: Endgame is a great wrap up and final goodbye to this part of the MCU. Just make sure if you have a soul to bring tissues with you.",
        "Nearly perfect in every way, Endgame justifies it's 3 hour run time with incredible character moments, epic scenes, and satisfying character write offs. The perfect extension of Infinity War...A five a half hour epic between the two films that I believe many will go back and watch time and time again. The only flaw I had was a bit of a slow pace in the beginning and some jokes that didn't land. Will Definitely be seeing multiple times!",
        "A movie that celebrates the lat 11 years of Marvel Movies, focusing on the first avengers and making you feel happy, sad and nostalgic in 3 hours long.",
        "Great movie... I really applaud it for having a clear structure, as there was a distinct beginning, middle and end. The story was really well told. It had a great balance of comedy and seriousness. It was really gripping and was able to evoke a lot of emotions.\n\nMy only 'critique' is that I think the beginning was too slow. To explain, although I think that segment was fantastic as a whole and I recognize that it gave context to the rest of the movie (and it did that well)... ultimately, I think it would have been beneficial to cut out some of those scenes.\n\nApart from that, I have no complaints. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it was a brilliant ending to the avengers series.",
        "I loved the movie soo much especially in 3D, it was everything that we didn't think we want but we need. The ending was in fact satisfying as Chris Evans said in an interview. This the only movie I rated it 10 because it gave us everything we expected and more.",
        "The End game gave me a lot of feelings. Joy,fear,excitement and sadness. In this movie I cried a lot. Because if you are a fan since 2008 it's kinda hard to see this movie. Besides of all that this movie was very fun. Especially Thor delivers the best jokes. You also gonna see things that will surprise you. You are going to say \"Holly sh** this actually happened\". But trust me you will go to the theater happy and excited and you are going to live happy and sad. But this movie it's promising it gives you what you want and even more. Believe me on that. I hope I didn't spoil anything for you I don't want to spoil anything because this movie is the greatest superheroe film ever. And as always stay a true fan.",
        "With the conclusion and a massive success of Infinity War, Endgame is now more hyped than ever. But with that comes reasonable concerns. How can Endgame possibly top its prequel? What could possibly happen that will make Endgame a rollercoaster ride as Infinity War was? Well, I am happy to say, the Russos did it again. They took all our heroes on journeys we never thought we would ever see. The Russos managed to add depth and humanity to every single character ranging from heroes to villains. Adding new and interesting arcs as well as wrapping up certain arcs in such a satisfying way. Masterful movie making.",
        "Many, many jokes, they wasted Hulk in this film. It's not the best Marvel movie, but it's also not the worst. It is a fun movie to spend the afternoon with the family.",
        "Avengers endgame is the best movie ever. Acting, cgi, soundrack, story everything is perfect. The final battle is my favourite scene from this movie, The first hour is a little slow but it shows the avengers planing how to defeat thanos. I cried, laughted and felt proud that i'm a marvel fan. This is the best movie in the history and i will remember it and i will tell to my children and nephews for the infinity saga. The legend Stan Lee appears in a little scene in the movie. The best movie ever. 10/10",
        "Easily best movie made by marvel, it was funny, sad, entertaining and just all round the best",
        "History tries to impose on me a drama that does not convince me. This leaves tedious several parts of the movie.",
        "This movie is the best movie ever made and most epic! Cannot describe it better! A must watch 3000 times!",
        "Story was decent, albeit a bit predictable. CGI was cumbersome, but I expected it to be so I dealt with it. There were some really good poignant scenes made this movie watchable to me. The bad was there were your typical action movie cliches that after hearing the audience guffawing and cheering over them, I have come to to peace with the cliches will live on forever. What I found interesting was that there are some unanswered questions that make me think that this is not actually an endgame, but what do I know? They were pretty damn significant to just leave out.\n\nBottom line it was a fun movie to see with the family and it was definitely something to see on the big screen.",
        "Well worth waiting a year for. Had just enough humour. Fantastic editing and special effects. One of the best movies I've ever seen!",
        "Steve Rogers went back through time and stayed there he alters his time in the present because he's a old man in the universe that he should be young.\n\nSo in the present day the Steve messed up his time line\n\nAlso to note the Thanos they snapped out of existence is not the same Thanos that was decapitated on Titan.\n\nAlso Note Gamora is back but from a different time as is The Nebula imposter that was from the past was killed by her future self.... So this leaves Natasha Black Widow..she can come back, but as her past self as we saw her in the Battle of New York etc.",
        "I feel like this movie really closed the franchise nicely. It's always hard to end an era, but this was a brilliant culmination of the buildup created throughout 20+ movies. Solidly concluded.",
        "Well its all combined nice endgame movie. Lot of surprises, emotions, laugh and fight.. its an whole package.",
        "Its a masterpiece. A perfect movie. Emotional and full of action rollar coaster ride. Please go and watch .",
        "Wow, what an ending to the incredible journey... Clever, endearing, thrilling, surprising, funny as, heartwarming and so utterly entertaining! How they accomplished so much within one film I do not know and yet those 3 hours went by in the blink of an eye. I would say that Captain Marvel sticks out like a bit of a sore thumb and is in contrast to the rest of the characters but thankfully she's not it in too much. All the favourites are on point throughout with special devotion given to the original 6 and yet it still manages to accommodate everyone new too. Quite a remarkable and I can't wait to get back to the cinema this weekend and watch it all over again! Thank you Marvel, you've achieved something extraordinary!",
        "It took me two sittings to finish, being at least 30 minutes too long.\n\nSome of the scenes were cringe worthy, but that was to satisfy the fans, not for any real reason for them to be there.\n\nThere were enough interesting ideas, and nice touches of humour, to make it worth watching.",
        "What do you get when you use cheap plot twists and rely on the worst character in the Marvel movie universe to sum up the effort of millions of hours, passion and execution? This dumb ending. It would have been better to leave it with half the universe dead than to create this tripe. Just one person's opinion. So many irrational elements, it isn't worth explaining to those without an iota of sense. It's Hollyweird's salute to the inane world they think we all want to live in.",
        "Amazing ending for the avengers! Although my favourite was the Ironman, it was nice to sacrifice for the good of all the others. It was an epic and heroic ending for him. I liked a lot the humor of hulk and especially Thor. Also I enjoyed the fights between Thanos and avengers. There were not overpowered scenes. Every little thing was perfect !!! Undoubtedly this movie movie deserves a 10/10 Bravo bravo bravo!!!",
        "One of the best movies I've seen in a while! I loved every single piece of this movie and I would highly recommend seeing it! Following on from Infinity War, Endgame carry's on nicely from Infinity War which is an amazing addition. Having be the last Avengers movie in the saga this movie finishes off well and leaves the cherry on top for the saga. Visuals where on point as well as cast and sfx. This movie in my opinion is definitely a movie I would watch again from beginning to end. Absolutely amazing!",
        "There is only one word to describe this film, a Masterpiece! This movie is the best movie I have ever seen! The fact the Russo Brothers made it 3 hours long was a great idea, I never felt bored nor disappointed during the 3 hours of the film. The movie's ending (in my opinion) is the best moment in cinematic history!",
        "Satiating end Game hulked with relevancy We loved three thousand\n\n~jodawa.",
        "Avengers endgame is the best mcu movie till date, you will really love this movie and Yes, the movie Is epic",
        "So its all come down to this. I had my hunches on what was going to transpire. Some of it was correct but it was delivered well. In fact, really well. The film is long, too long. However, I rarely clock watched despite a feeling of being quite slow early on. It has an epic start and finish although the middle feels different to the usual. Thats not a bad thing. Im not the biggest superhero movie fan, I'm a little tired of the overused formulas. I think its a miracle they made this work having all superheros together at once, they did well. Overall though I cant escape the feeling of unevenness and feeling cheated by some of the abilities of the superheroes which do not feel even or equal out fairly on screen. Theres little feeling of tension as a result or dread. I didn't care for the characters enough in comparison to say the Dark Knight Trilogy. Its a good movie, no doubt about it but not sure its worth its absolute plaudits.",
        "'Avengers: Endgame' is a film that manages to serve the 21 MCU films before it in a way that is almost magical, and near perfect. The film does a wonderful job at tying up and concluding so many storylines that have been present throughout the last 11 years and 22 films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film manages to out-do itself and delivers on absolutely gigantic and epic proportions. While the film isn't perfect and there are some slight gripes and nitpicks I definitely have, it is perfectly satisfying in the way it manages to close itself up. 'Endgame' offers a justifiable conclusion that can best be described as epic.",
        "Just amazing. The humour combined with the emotional turmoil makes this one of the greatest films ever. I didn't think there could be a fight scene as intense as infinity war...I was wrong. Just amazing!",
        "Thoroughly enjoyed a way throw and builds with great momentum, not only is this an action movie so much emotion that slowly builds, I loved the development & build up leading to its finale conclusion, this is what visiting cinema is all about and leaving on a high.\n\nThis is more then a part 2 of End Game but very much it's own movie that leads to its bitter sweet ending.\n\nDirector brothers who decided less advertising / marketing prove this is vital to ensure been moments / scenes are left for the audience to discover as it unravels on the big s screen, well done guys!",
        "Absolutely perfect ending to the entire saga. There is so much packed into this movie. Emotion, action, drama. I absolutely love it.",
        "Epic finale for Avengers series. You will see massive amount of Marvel characters and many familiar places from previous movies. Big wins and big losses. But a bit too epic for me, liked previous part more. And the way to get Infinity Stones back is a slippery way, makes more questions than answers.\n\nWhere is Loki now? Why Nebula still hangs out? Etc\n\nBest char award: Thor as a guy next door.",
        "First of all the movie trailer doesn't show anything of the movie so you can't know what happens. This movie was the best way to celebrate much 10 years it contains great action beautiful end. And you stay in the seat in each second of the movie amazing movie .trust me go watch now",
        "This huge amounts of charecters made the main story something you lose yourself within it and dont know whats going on really in the infinity war they gave some logic to the idea of evil side of the story but again in this part they show it as something just want to destroy with its primitive ideas its realy unfair to compare this one time seen movie to batman. joker the movie one can see many times and still be enjoyed as you was seening it for the first time",
        "The best ever superhero movies.. Don't listen the haters \"DC Fans\" Please go watch yourself that MASTERPIECE, BEAUTIFUL, EPICMOVIE",
        "This is an emotional roller coaster that honors in a superb way the last 10 years of Marvel movies. It's a perfect conclusion to an era. It's 3 hours long but it feels like 1. It all happens so fast. I was on the verge of tears like 5 or 6 times. The dilemma Tony faces throughout the movie is very well executed. The characters, although many, have enough things to do during the movie. It's non-stop action and it never gets slow. The script has, naturally, the advantage of dealing with characters (and a situation) we already know and love, and that are well defined, but creates something new with it all. It's been an incredible journey. And a part of the journey, is the end.",
        "This movie is better than the previous one, infinity war. Worth a watch as an entertaining movie, but I'm not impressed or have anything to remember",
        "Marvel best movie ever .. mind blowing ,great action must match..",
        "This is a movie thats really worth your time, especially the final fight. I don't want to spoil the movie but its worth 3 hours of your time",
        "One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. The plots really stunned me. It's a filled with everything that a movie should have. Great respect to Joe and Anthony and the full credit goes to the father of MCU, Stan Lee \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d",
        "It was good.... not great.... just good. I was expecting more, but satisfied with what I got.",
        "I was not disappointed. I wouldn't be bored even if it was 5 hours!",
        "This has to be the greatest movie of all time, never ever have I seen a film as phenomenal as this, in every department.",
        "Great story, phenomenal actors, amazing cgi and cinematography, awesome battles.",
        "I'll keep it short. The acting is pretty good, where the characters are allowed to be in shot for more than a few seconds. No-one is allowed to dominate and it feels the directors emphasised the strengths of the protagonists. The strong one, the honest one, the kind one, the damaged on.\n\nAs others pointed out the plot was preposterous but made up for by great subplots.\n\nThe effects were huge and fortunately not quite as confusing as Transformers.",
        "Some people compare the Avengers series with the Star Wars series and the Lord of the Rings series. I don't know where the comparison is. Not to mention that the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings are of the movie history level, at least in one sense, none of the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings series is a single movie about a single character. Their films have many characters, but what they produce can be called epics. Films like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are enduring classics and will be model textbooks for many years to come. So which Marvel movie is worthy of the word \"classic\"? Over the past 11 years, I have followed the footsteps of Superhero movie. I have seen all the Marvel movies shown in the cinema. I can only say that I am worthy of myself. But if one only talks about feelings when evaluating a movie, what are the other values of this movie?",
        "The MCU breaks the Record of the world's box office!",
        "Avengers: Endgame 8 of 10 ---Dialogue 4.5 of 5 -Characters 4 of 5 -Pace 4 of 5 -Plot 3.5 of 5 (contrived) ---Sound/Track 4.5 of 5 -Acting 4 of 5 -Art/Location 4 of 5 -Cinematography 3.5 of 5 (uninspired, taco ftw)",
        "Endgame was certainly the end of an amazing saga. Epic, touching, funny, sad. It has a little of everything. True - it's overly long, but if you are a fan of ANY of the characters, you really didn't want it to end. Beautifully done, Disney. You have my complete respect. You took something that could have been a few cheesy kid movies and made them enjoyable for most ages and ended it with great reflection. You hired great actors, writers, directors and made brilliant products - Bravo!",
        "Well all i can say is i didn't see that coming i ended up going to watch this movie on opening weekend oh boy what a mistake i got stuck in the front row and could only see a third of the screen lol ! other then that this movie was really entertaining so many great action shots and man this time you felt like the bad guy had the upper hand you can almost feel how down the Avengers are after the last movie don't want to give anything away but its a good time for family's or grown children both will be very entertained",
        "Goodbye Avengers and well done for all the amazing movies, brought a lot of joy to a lot of people.",
        "A spectacular culmination that is in many ways better than previous instalments. Endgame can be surprising, nostalgic, touching, there's better character development, it's not afraid to be self-ironic and changes style and pace. The first third is rather intimate, the second is more relaxed and the finale is grandiose action inferno. However, all these parts fit together pretty nicely. Sure, there are weaker moments and many things can be justifiably criticized (fan-service, plot holes, sometimes slow pacing etc.) But those are just small (and expected) negatives when compared to the huge scope of Marvel's cinematic universe that was build up over entire decade.\n\nMy hat's off to you, Marvel, you're an indisputable pop-culture phenomenon.",
        "It's not one of the best movies in The Avengers series, but it's appreciable. The movie is a bit slow and has less action than the previous ones. One thing I noticed is that the right leftist thinking has come to Marvel once and for all. I imagine the next movies will be based on such an ideology. The presence of Captain Marvel and her attitudes in the plot is proof of this.",
        "After 11 years and 22 films, the Infinity Saga finally concludes with Avengers: Endgame. It's truly an experience to watch this in cinema, for the creativity, the emotional impact, surprises, and the fun this film brings. Despite the 182 minute run time, it is excellently paced and rarely has a feeling of dragging out for too long.\n\nHowever, I only recommend this film to those individuals who have watched most if not all of the films prior to Avengers: Endgame in the Infinity Saga. A causal moviegoer may or may not enjoy it, but someone who has followed the saga from the very beginning will most likely appreciate this film for it is the finale after all.",
        "I am speechless.... This movie is so cool and yet I am sad that this marks the end of the Avengers.",
        "Avengers:Endgame lacks the pace that infinity war had and some defining moments and storylines may seem a bit stretched. But with stunning visuals, staggering emotions, incredible acts and a satisfying end makes it something to be experienced.",
        "Great story telling with heaps of humor, make this movie very enjoyable. i think its the most enjoyable marvel movie after infinity wars. bit tears too t.t",
        "I just want to say how amazing this film is from start to finish. This will take you on a emotional ride.\n\nYou will not he disappointed",
        "To be honest, after infinity war i didn't think they could match it, but they managed to match it and i might even say surpass it. I'm a little late to the party but once i got the chance i went and can honestly say 3 hours flew by and i came out feeling emotional and wanting to talk to everybody about it which to me means the film was spot on. The end battle was absolutely epic but would recommend in 2d as in 3d it was very hard to catch everything going on. I will most definitely be returning to watch again.",
        "I supposed some kind of time travelling to bring back the fallen ones, but in a more smart and exciting way. And what the hell they did to the Thor character?",
        "Avengers - Endgame offers a stunning and moving ending. There are times to laugh, but also times to cry. Many did at the end. Thank you Marvel.",
        "Avengers Endgame literally blew me away. I just came back from the cinema and I am still amazed and shocked from what I have just watched. This movie is full of humour, action, sadness and as well as bringing back memories from the previous MCU movies. Avengers Endgame is the best superhero film yet and is the best way to end the Infinity Saga. It's also gonna be hard to try not to spoil anything!",
        "Loved it to bits. Saw it twice in one day. Perfect ending to the infinity saga and cant wait to see what is next.",
        "Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. Respect for the Russo Brothers for taking the direction they did with Endgame and it really does satisfy but Infinity War is overall a more entertaining movie. An experience you'll gonna remember forever.",
        "This last avengers movie is epic, everything is just fantastic except of course the finale :( don't reveal the events of the movie, this movie deserves to be no.1 of all movies.",
        "Loved every minute of it and I'm going to view it again! Favourite movie of all! Can't wait for more!",
        "This movie had everyone in the movie theatre cheering, laughing and crying throughout the whole movie. Everything you'd hope Endgame to be, IS just that.",
        "Man this movie is just awesome. Its funny , full of action and emotional hell lot of emotion. Booked 1st show of the day and can't get it out a my head. Surely Marvel doesn't disappoint ( never). Its a proper justice to Avengers Franchise.",
        "I know I'm late to the game here, but I can't remember the last time a movie lived up to THIS much hype...if anything, they undersold it a little. Three hours went by like 90 minutes....by the end I was just slackjawed. I now wish I'd seen it opening night. Anyone nitpicking this movie....I am so sorry for your sad little life.",
        "Was very entertaining, marvel hasn't really put a foot wrong compared to DC. Feels like the end of the franchise too an I need not need to see anymore from the franchise. Thanks for the memories maybe?",
        "This is a great film, although it's slow start, it does make up for it towards the rest of the film. Truly recommended for those marvel fanatics.",
        "The day has come where all comes to an end. The hype was high and so do the ratings and although I am not a marvel comics fan (but a movie's one) I must agree with it. This is probably the best marvel movie ever.\n\nAfter 10 years all comes to this and I must sat it is a good way to end. All good things come to an end and so do the avengers. Now we can only wait and see what Disney will do but nothing will ever be the same.\n\nMeanwhile I will sit on a corner a decide what to do with my life!!",
        "You will have these set of things that you would expect from a superhero movie and this one checks every box and more. You will definitely will not feel that this was not enough. Just about everything in the right amount. You get laughter,you get a gripping story,you get a wonderful thrilling experience ,if u are a marvel fan then this would be the perfect movie for you. The direction was perfect CGI on point,nothing to change,nothing to correct. The story even lets you brush up on the earlier movies which i felt was awesome, they couldn't have done it any better. Overall OUTSTANDING (MASTERPIECE for a marvel fan) Had to put two verdicts",
        "I am a very great fan of Avengers. I did like the film, and watched all Avengers. What I didn't like in this film was the premise. It was very relatable to the other Avengers, but it didn't really make much sense, even if the plot and storyline was obvious. It was obvious, but the storyline was obsolete. Basically out of context and out of date.\n\nNonetheless, I really enjoyed watching, and the overall character animation. not worth watching twice, but definitely a film worth watching. A franchise worth watching.",
        "I don't have a lot to say but this was amazing work. The combination of all the great Marvel movies in the past 11 years to get this. Also so many references and jokes that were really funny especially if you know the movies well.",
        "I'm no reviewer of films but just my two cents! That was amazing! It was the perfect way to end a 22 film cycle that will never be done again and that is why it gets a 10 from me.",
        "Amazing how Marvel has created this cinematic universe. So many good stories, all connected. This movie was long but great to watch.",
        "This movie had me crying, laughing, gasping and completely mesmerised from start to finish. It was worth the wait, it was full of things I did not expect and some things I did, which is good too! I honestly loved it and I'm going to go back and watch it again. YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.",
        "I have watched it thrice now. Was excited all 3 times. This movies is \"America's Ass\" bloody amazing. Triggers all emotions and I felt them all even when I watched it for the third time. This movie is everything you would want and even more. Russo brothers are legends. I don't know how they pull of something this great making sure the movie gave importance to each and every character in it.... I know how hard it can be when u got a lot of superheroes in one movie and you got to make sure u don't screw it up. Russo,s did not... Thank you for this.\n\nSuch a great way to end this journey. What an ending! ENDGAME",
        "Most electrifying scenes of all time, most emotional scenes of all time, greatest action, hardest goodbyes, comedy, tear rolling big six credits... and so much more. I just wish the writers gave Iron man and Thor their own great moments to shine during the fight with thanos.",
        "Basically, a clip-show. The writing is uncharacteristically sub-par. The whole endeavor is uncharacteristically formulaic. The actors turn in their usual grade-A performances, but deadened by a dead script. Too many elements are gratuitous. If you're new to the franchise, don't judge it by this; if you've been with it for the whole ride--but remain somewhat objective--I'm afraid you might be disappointed.",
        "Although it's a slow build all the emotional investments count in a film that is more about the characters we've come to love as they work through loss rather than the next battle they'll fight. Each of our original heroes complete their arcs. A fitting end to a mammoth undertaking."
