        "This movie was dishonestly mauled by critics and reviewers simply because it was directed by Snyder. Watching this again in 2020, I have to say this will go down as a classic in years to come. It's an absolute blast from start to finish and is one of the most loyal adaptations and faithful to the Superman lore found in DC comics. One of its greatest achievements was the magnificent depiction of Krypton and giving Zod the gravitas and motivation that he lacked in Superman II. You felt empathy for him. Shannon was outstanding in his portrayal of Zod; up there with Ledger's Joker.\n\nI remember people actually complained about the level of destruction in this movie and the excessive use of special effects, but for me this is what makes a Superman movie. Take off your nostalgia tinted glasses and watch this with an open mind. This is the greatest Superman movie bar none.",
        "Hands down the best Superman movie out there. Way ahead of its time.",
        "So we are looking at essentially a remake of Superman (nothing wrong with that). So how does it compare? Favourably.\n\nThe original is perhaps a little softer, more romantic and more idyllic whereas the remake is darker, richer and a little more interesting.\n\n2 changes that worked for me, the origin part of the story on Krypton which is much more expansive (creating more of a universe feel, literally) and the extended character of Superman Senior. Brando was the quintessential sci-fi 'head in a bottle' character using him to explain Supe's back story in the original, Crowe's character came full combat ready and I think it added well to the overall story.\n\nReally enjoyable effort that sits well as a representative of the DC universe :)",
        "I love Superman. Every version. I'll defend Superman 4 if you want? But this is the definitive version. The version I've always dreamed of seeing - the version I'd write if I could have. Challenging, thought-provoking, insightful. Not there to be a poster child, but rather to be an inspiration. Inspiration comes through internal struggle and strife, not through BANG BANG, POW POW. I wish DC had more faith in this storyline - cause it was clearly going somewhere wonderful. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut.",
        "Am I one of the few people who actually love this movie? Man of Steel has beautiful visuals, an amazing cast ensemble, and action scenes to blow you away. The story is better than that awful Superman Returns movie and it's like the actors are doing their best. It's no Wonder Woman or Aquaman, but its a very fun watch and completely unforgettable!!",
        "I never had the opportunity to see this film in theatres, though, after my first viewing at home, I was instantly blown away by the tone, visuals, soundtrack, story, performance, thriller and action to this film.\n\nMan of steel truely felt as though it was an alien invasion film set in our present time.\n\nSuperman has literally searched to find himself and when he does, he must learn not only learn his origins, though his abilities and how to use them.\n\nHe was bound to question himself and make mistakes along the way and following his journey is something I'm extremely excited for.\n\nMost certainly a superhero film for adults.",
        "I think this was the last superhero movie I liked. It looks and feels like it's set in the real world still instead of somebody's computer.\n\nThe story is tripe but what do you expect? Visually it's excellent.\n\nMaybe could do with a bit more colour.",
        "I am old enough to have seen the original 2 Christopher Reeve Superman movies, and the idea of combining them is great. Henry Cavill is a better Superman, Amy Adams is a better Lois Lane, the script is far stronger, the baddies are more believable, I honestly can't understand the negatives; with the exception of the first 20 minutes, which just didn't work. A great attempt, far better than most DC movies, except the Nolan ones.",
        "It is the most criminally Underrated superhero movie ever. It's also the movie that made me love Superman .Zack Snyder best work and Hans Zimmer was amazing. Visuals , Storytelling and Action scene were top notch .Too bad this movie did not get a proper sequel",
        "By far the most epic and iconic visual experience for a comic movie. Totally recommended.",
        "Man of Steel is an incredibly epic origin story for Superman that's emotional and action packed, even though there is a little too much destruction in the third act. Henry Cavill is great as Superman. Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon are all great as well. Zack Snyder's direction is fantastic and the film is extremely well filmed with amazing action sequences. It's well paced and the CG is consistently stunning. The music by Hans Zimmer is incredible.",
        "As usual, I find that for some when a movie is made about a super-hero, it has to fit into some pigeonhole, determined by years of comic books. God forbid that someone tries to find a different angle or a new approach. As usual, there is all this nit-picking about details that don't seem real. For heaven's sake, the guy can fly, comes as a baby from another planet, and can go back and forth in time. Let's check the reality thing right now. There have been so many reviews of this that I doubt I can contribute much that is new, but for me, the guy was a multi-dimensional character who has to deal with a hand that is dealt to him. I'm waiting for Superman XIX, \"Superman on the Psychiatrist's Couch.\" The guy must have incredible angst during his private moments and feel the weight of the world. Anyway, the acting is quite good, there is lots of action, and under the circumstances, he seems pretty real.",
        "This is what I've been waiting for my whole life - a Superman film that tackles big issues, big ideas and takes risks. I've liked every superman film I've ever seen - but this one felt like it finally lived up to the potential of the character. 11 stars if I could.",
        "I'm a big fan of the character, it has a lot of exciting moments, a good story and a wonderful soundtrack. Sure, it's not a perfect movie, far from it, but I got excited all the time.",
        "Great movie! Perfectly cast. Wish they'd move forward with a sequel.",
        "It's super man again but this time it has a different name",
        "When the trailer came out for this, I was so stoked. Hans Zimmer's score gave me chills and I couldn't wait (still one of my favorite soundtracks). I also remember leaving theaters a little shocked at how different it was and thinking I didn't love it. Never thought it was bad, just not great. Years later after all the other DCEU movies that came out, this is my favorite one in retrospect. Cavill looks good with the suit on, and I can see what Snyder was aiming for.",
        "This is one of the greatest comic book films of all time, and definitely a great film standing on it's own. Everything from the cinematography, the actors, the story, the action, the score, Zack has created something incredible.\n\nIgnore all the critics that bash this movie, instead listen to the fans.",
        "I have always wanted to see a remake of the first Superman film. I've always thought that a new film with General Zod would be awesome and this film did deliver just that.",
        "I love this film, Henry Cavill is fantastic and completely embodies and understands the character. I have watched this film several times and it is something that you can watch over and over again and still enjoy it every time. Zack Snyder does a great job as director and for Christopher Nolan fans yes he was involved in a different capacity as well. All involved are great.",
        "We've seen so many Superman movies and tv shows, but this movie is definitely the best Superman so far. Why is it so underrated? Great visuals, acting, music, story. What else do you need?\n\nMy second favorite DC movie.",
        "The most underrated superhero movie of all time. One of the Best superhero origin movie.",
        "Look, I love this movie because it's so different than the other superman movies we've had. A lot of people hate on it because it's \"too dark\" and \"superman isn't like that\" its like come on now they didn't change the character too drastically...\n\nI try to watch this film once a year, Henry Cavill is my superman. Idgaf what others might say.",
        "I don't understand the hate, It's a banger from start to finish, and Henry Cavill was born to play Supes, it's just so stupid how critics reviewed this movie.",
        "Like many people I grew up with Superman, and although I've done a lot of growing up since then, the legacy lives on, and I've revisited it many times.\n\nI'm becoming a bit of a fan of Zack Snyder amongst the newer directors and having just watched 'Man of Steel' for the first time I must say I think it's the best film about the Superman legend.\n\nThe final part of the film had perhaps too much computer graphics for my liking, but it did not ruin the film.",
        "The other 2 are The Avengers and Captain America: Winter Soldier. Others don't come close to these 3.",
        "1st off if they get rid of Henry Cavill as superman they're absolute idiots hes the best superman yet he fits perfectly. I was a HUGE Reeve fan but Cavill just seems perfect. Now they're talking about replacing him with a black actor WHAT???? Superman isnt black it doesn't make any sense , so take away our culture, WHY??? Create NEW superheroes that are black I understand that we need diversity in films but create new ones dont take away Iconic characters like superman it doesn't make sense. That would be like making Cavill the new black panther . Anyway this film is absolutely brilliant great cast phenomenal special effects the 3d is excellent, it's a combination scifi super hero film. EXTREMELY UNDERRATED we've watched it several times and love it everytime.",
        "Awesome, fun movie! A bit slow during the middle act but it picks up the pace leading into the 3rd act! 7.5/10!",
        "Best superman movie ever, great acting, great direction.",
        "This movie, Wonderwoman and Aquaman are truely the best movies in the DCEU. I hope they are expanded upon.\n\nTakes Superman from a \"funny character\" to a seriously interesting and gritty one.",
        "I think this is one of the less plot-issue riddled films with a more fluid and enjoyable story. Maybe it's because Nolan was part of the writing as well as Goyer. Casting and performances were excellent, as was the S/VFX and score. It's a must-see first installment before Batman vs Superman (I suggest watching the extended cut) followed by Zack Snyders Justice League.",
        "Interesting story, nice action scenes and excellent actors!!",
        "8 years ago critics tried to destroy this film, so that was the main reason I stopped to pay attention what they are saying. This is one of the most underrated films. In my opinion its because of Zack Snyder who is always firstly thinks and works for audience, and in this case for DC fans. Firs of all the cast of the film is too good. Henry Cavil is the best Superman that we've got (and I hope that WB is not going to recast him). When you're watching you can feel the connection between actors. Snyder's vision about DC is little bit darker and different from other films based on comic books. But it's good because of uniformity of superhero films. Also the motivation of antagonist is quite clear. Soundtracks are on another level, Hans Zimmer has done great job as always. Watch it and you'll not regret it.",
        "Don't judge this movie. Don't listen to what others have to say about it(positive or negative) don't compare this with other superman or superhero films.",
        "It's just pretty good with some good action and a great score from my boy Hans Zimmer.\n\nIn a place where many consider to be a jail cell but more specifically the place where I lose the most brain cells.",
        "We all know the review for this movie werent the best but after you watch it, you now probaly dont understand what those people where thinking. It is a really slow movie and at somepoints the runtime really feels long but all that time is because the movie wants to show you all the conflicts Superman has. And honestly at the end, not a lot of those conflicts are resolved and actually explored a little more in BvS and ZSJL. And those conflicts are interesting since we are not used in seeing Superman have this problems and the final battle compensates all the wait for a fight. So I do think it is a good movie, just misunderstood.",
        "The movie was good idk why people hate it,and CGI was pretty solid. Watch this movie if you like superheroes movies.",
        "Fantasy/invasion movie. A huge production/remake/reboot of Superman 1 and 2 in a modern version. Christopher Nolan in script and production and Zack Snyder in directing is in themselves a guarantee of success. Indeed, the result is a modern version of Superman, which, although it does not have the memorable Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, nor the \"innocence\" of those films and that era, is the most mature and serious Superman film ever released. Excellent story, dialogues, acting and directing, incredible shots, soundtrack and realistic effects, in a complete and flawless film, which fills many gaps of old films. Really the whole cast not only of the central actors but also of the secondary, all experienced and with excellent acting. The difference between serious DC and childish Marvel is clear once again. The Man of Steel is a film for everyone, a modern, epic about the classic story of Superman and is MUST seen for everyone. An excellent result worth all the efforts to be made.",
        "This is the best superman movie as far and perfect balance of dark and emotion and it set the base of DCEU awesome movie highly recommend to watch for those one who haven't seen the masterpiece.",
        "I can never forget that flying seagull in the sky roving over an obvious seaside house, water dropping from the eaves into a bucket of half full with clothespins, splashing violently all over. Washed socks airing in the wind. It is a so simple, so everyday-like yet so poetic chain of events, it took my breath away. It made the whole film lifelike. That 15 seconds - in my opinion - made this movie great. From then on I bought everything, even if it was silly. I think this is the best Superman movie ever made, not because of CGI but rather the mood it creates. It was released 8 years after Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, but I think it falls into the same category. Yeah. It is that good.",
        "One of the best super movie ever.\n\nFrom Super man to Gen zod Each character was so awesome and so accurate. Loved it.\n\nVillian was shown as a man who is committed to his purpose.",
        "The 1980's Superman movie will always be a classic and should be. Man of Steel didn't just give us a more detailed and deeper origin movie. But made us feel exactly what it is to be Superman. The Blessing of being bullet proof and being able to fly can also be a curse. That he's not so invincible. That Despite his abilities he's just the same as you and me, And that is what makes him Our Superman. That despite being from a different planet he grew up in Kansas. he's as American as it gets.",
        "Veryyyy good super gero movie....nice story and action.",
        "Watching it again on HBO MAX. I was swayed by criticism of this film. It's perfect. Not a complete retelling of his origin story. Well paced. Beautiful special effects. Cavil is perfect as the man of steel. Snyder does a masterful job. Give it another chance.",
        "The casting was great, the SFX is great the story is great but a little long. Probably the first movie I've ever though was too long instead of too short but they definitely drug a pretty thin story line out further than needed. That seems to be part of Snyder's MO so whatever. Definitely a better movie than most of the reviews, especially the reviews from when the movie first debuted.",
        "Well, Zack Snyder knows exactly how to make a comic book based movie! I'm okay with the dark tone, even with Superman! The action sequences were phenomenal, which were enhanced much by the scores of Hans Zimmer.",
        "Way better than marvel's Deadpool, ant man stupid movies. This movie will be remembered for long long time.",
        "This is the perfect movie. It entirely embodied Superman and everyone in his life. Best Superman film to ever see the light of day.",
        "I don't know if I needed a time with it but before I didn't like this movie I couldn't stand to watch it or maybe I mixed it up with Superman Returns. I'm not sure. Special effects are amazing storyline is so good. Of course acting of the actors is amazing. Amy Adams great as always. I got surprised by the intro to the movie, by the story of how Superman got to the Earth since I don't know the story. I rated it with 9 because I don't like effect of speed when Superman fly's or when he moves, the CGI of that is weird and I don't like it. And the movie itself it is not for 10 stars so...",
        "Let me start off by saying I have watched this movie more times than any other movie.\n\nHot damn is this the best DC/superhero/any movie action you'll ever see.\n\nNo, this is not a Christopher Reeves' Superman feel good movie, but a bit gritty, realistic take on Superman in our world.\n\nNo, this is not as humorous as Marvel superhero movies, and thank goodness for that - they often take away from the movie and set a different tone. A serious take on Superman with him showing all his powers in all his glory is a big tick in my box.",
        "Wow. This film was way better than I expected. Was is mindless? YES. Did it have many WTF moments which do not make any sense? YES. But the action for the most part was so awesome that I can overlook all its flaws for the sake how much fun I had. I loved the sound design, the music, dark colour palette, fantastic camera work, and most importantly very high quality CGI which the action is based on. I'm all for practical effects, but this film proves that sometimes even with CGI you can create spectacular action.",
        "How people weren't into this is such a mystery. I loved everything about it. The only thing wrong is that the action scenes go on a little long but they're cool so it's fine. It's great to see Superman with a new spin after basically being the same for 70 years but still staying true to what he is.\n\nThis isn't a Superman comic this is a becoming Superman movie, which we've never had before. He's usually young an then suddenly Superman. It's great to see him learning how to be Superman.\n\nI really like how SciFi it was. Because finding out an alien was on Earth would shake things up. Every other version people just see that a man can fly and basically accept it.",
        "This movie is beautiful, from the wonderful story telling to the amazing cinematography, boy this movie is great. The acting, the directing, that last two meaning piece of dialogue at the end. Everything is just great about this movie. Praying for man of steel 2 (which might not happen since a Superman reboot was confirmed to be in development a few days ago) . Even if we don't get it, we still have this movie to look back on, and the rest of Snyder's creations.",
        "Definetely the best Superman movie to date. Brilliant story, fantastic actors. Henry Cavill is on a par with Christopher Reeves as Superman. Michael Shannon is a fab Zod too. One of the best superhero movies around and seriously underrated.",
        "(Writing this review after I wrote the review for \"The Incredibles\" movie)\n\nSuperman. The perfect superhero. Clean. Good looking guy. Moves with stealth.\n\nEven though he comes from another part of the universe, he grew up with an average family. I love how they have Superman's dad as an innocent and genuine man. It builds Superman into a man of character that can use his powers effectively and is more than just \"the man in the suit\".\n\nI've always loved and appreciated this movie and character. It has an innocent goodness to it.",
        "The dark tone of \"Man of Steel\" probably fits well with some people, but for me, it just seems like they wanted to make Superman the same way Nolan made Batman back in 2005. The darkness of this movie doesn't help the story even the slighest and it actually makes the movie a lot more flat and boring, because it doesn't fit with the character of Superman. The first half of the movie is pretty well-made, but the second and third halves are really just a visual aspect of something that we never asked for.",
        "Follows Superman 2 but in a more detailed way with depth to the story. It's a roller coaster ride and I'd forgotten how good this movie is. Great effects, emotional with Clark's family and superb entertainment.",
        "I liked this movie overall but it missed 3 pounts from me because of how crazy over the top it got near the end. Overall, good story and acting etc",
        "Everybody in it is fantastic. The story is fantastic.....the world building is fantastic...rivals the dark knight.!!! I just wish the two universes never met.....this was pure !!! Whoever drew this one up made the best story !!! What a cast !!!! What a story !!!! I was so suprised at how they made this so great...suspension of disbelief happens by default.....its amazing....second time i've seen it and its just wonderful cinema on all levels. Thanks for this movie.",
        "Unfortunately, this movie was bashed upon its release by critics etc. Its has indeed a darker tone thank other superhero movies. Unfortunately, people was so used to the MCU formula that when this movie came out, they didn't not understand it (I think).\n\nRewatching it after the Release of Zack Snyder's Justice League, I have to say that this is a blast. The Superman arc is beautiful and everything starts with this movie. So watch this, BvS and ZSJL, and you'll appreciate this movie more as this is not a Stand Alone story.",
        "I was really happy with the origin story aspect of this movie... although I would have liked to see more of Kevin Costner's character. I didn't see this until New Year's Eve 2020 and had heard a lot of comments about the movie... positive land negative. Exceeded my expectations.",
        "I liked the beginning, with the beginning, the birth of the Man of Steel, with good effects, I enjoyed it ... I liked it so much, I can safely say that it is one of the best of Superman, whose theme I am not a fan, the hurricane scene beautiful and exciting, although it has no relation to HQ # sad... Good drama, Bullying, lots of action, little humor...",
        "I've gave 10 stars before I've even watched all of the movie. Reason being is, I'm a massive D.C. Fan with superman being my favourite. But...I'm sorry, there is no way Batman could kill superman. Also I was just reading about the actor who plays superman.\n\nThere is no way what's so ever that he got his BF (BodyFat) down down to 3%. Who are they kidding? Dropping down to 3% he would be on the boarder of being dead. For those who doesn't really know, your body has/needs essential fats to keep alive. Bodybuilders go down to 5% before competition, they also dehydrate the water from the body. That's why many Collapse on stage.\n\nThe truth is they have gave the actor steroids along with a nutrition plan. Remember, everyone wants that body and not the natural looking guy.",
        "Man of Steel fulfills its role as a generic blockbuster in cinema with clarity, with surprising action, but a script silly enough to say that it was a good start for this DC Extended Universe with several narrative flaws and a disappointing ending.",
        "Best superman ever!!! Snyder's creation truly epic.",
        "Nothing could do Christofer Reeves justice but Henry Cavill came damn close!\n\nWow, what a man of steel! I hope this PC master race of an actor gives us a few more movies as superman.",
        "This movie is 50/50 to fans. I personally enjoyed it but not really a re-watchable one. I'll explain below\n\nThe film was enjoyable. The direction was good, the OST was spectacular as were the visuals and special effects. The costume design was superb and Henry Cavill and Amy Adams shared great chemistry\n\nIt is however, not a masterpiece. The story was weak at points and the final fight did not represent Superman at all. Once you see the film, you'll know why. Snyder did pretty good but again, he is not a masterclass and whilst I liked this movie, it could've benefited from someone who understood the character better and someone who could write a great story.",
        "Forget everything you think you know, this is the best Superman film period. This is an emotionally resonating film that humanises a god among us, accompanied by an amazing score from Hanz Zimmer. Plenty of heart, action and Snyder's trademark visuals, which are beyond stunning as always.",
        "I am a DC fan but for years i was more into Marvel. After Thor Ragnarok i kind of start to dislike this whole everything is a joke kind of new era of movies. And dont understand why i didnt like Man of Steel that much in the past since i loved the dark Dark Knight..\n\nWhy im telling all of this? i went to watch Man Of Steel again and wow! this blew me away. I liked everything from it!! no jokes, good acting, good effects/cgi and sometimes a different take on the hero and awesome Superman actor.\n\nI do think we didnt understood Zakk vision back in 2013! im preparing for the 18 of march to watch his magnus opus The Justice League finally and I do believe after the Dark Knight trilogy this Trilogy is going to be my favorite!",
        "I really enjoyed this movie. I am a big fan of action and superhero movies, and this did not disappoint. First of all I thought they did a great job on casting Superman. Henry Cavill fits the role perfectly. I liked the supporting cast, except thought they could have done better with Lois Lane. The plot starts out with Superman (Kal-El) being born, and quickly jumps into him being in his 20's and saving people. They show some of his growing up, through flashbacks but I wish they would have done more of this. You don't have to see any previous Superman movies to see this one, you get the whole back story. There was a ton of good action scenes, almost too much I thought. Plot was pretty good, but also pretty predictable. I saw the 3-D version, and I am not a big fan of 3-D. While this movie did not give me a headache, like 'The Hobbit', I didn't think the 3-D added that much, and I would recommend seeing the 2-D version! Overall I gave it a 9/10. Good action, fun, entertaining movie.",
        "I saw this movie on its release day, assuming I love Snyder and all of his filmography in general. When this film was announced I had very high expectations and they weren't disappointed at all, but let's take it easy. The film lasts 2 hours and 23 minutes, as the film progresses it is very slow at the beginning in my opinion, so let's say that the first hour feels in full all the weight if you can say so. But the climate of the film changes drastically, the last hour is all explosions and fighting and if managed by Snyder they are nothing short of spectacular. In short it can be said that in my opinion Snyder did an excellent job but mishandling the flashbacks and the pacing of the film, the thing I appreciate however is the fact that the film is full of Easter Eggs, which almost made the vision of the film almost like a game and it's not bad at all.",
        "The story has some very good parts. The special effects here are beautiful. I liked Henry Cavil as Superman, I think he is perfect for this role. One of my only complains are that were didn't get to see a lot of Clark Kent. Also, the Fight scene is way too long. But still i enjoyed this movie.",
        "Watched it today again and this movie still feels something you'd believe made in 2021. Maybe in 2013 the advanced CGI and destruction felt unreal but this movie will be known as one of the finest made superhero movies. Story, CGI, action, the overall profession, everything is perfect. I was hoping Zack Snyder will release an extended cut but I'm happy with what we have. Can't wait for the future DC universe movies.",
        "Pure entertainment throughout. Epic fight scenes and great acting and great characters. Zod is a really good villain in this movie. Extremely good visual effects and dialogue. Definitely a must watch.",
        "An amazing film that begins the dceu. I actually liked the tone of the film and it was one of the best parts of the film. Henry cavil is amazing as Superman. Definitely a must watch.",
        "Awesome movie! They humanized Superman/Clark Kent perfectly, all while symbolizing hope, and being Superman.",
        "\"Man of Steel\" is Zack Snyder's best film I've seen. It's great, actiom-packed and, now that I've seen every DCEU film, the best film (so far) in its universe",
        "Superman (1978) and this movie are the best (not cartoon animated) movies of Superman. Trust me.",
        "That's all I heard from a group of fan boys or people completely tied to the Christopher Reeves Superman movies. I kept saying you'll appreciate it in the future. The Reeves superman movies are good movies, but this isn't those and good. I'm tired of rehash crap. Fast forward to today when Zack Snyder's Justice League League dropped and I think everyone and I mean everyone has changed their tune. The ones I know personally are getting a bunch of I told ya so's from yours truly. I'm not above it.",
        "I liked this film. But it is a bit long to watch. I recommend it to all DC fans.",
        "It's good,that's all,all this people talk rubbish,it was enjoyable. And best of all, everything does not revolve around Lois or Lana, Smallville was good but damn,Lana was the worst.",
        "I haven't watched any of the earlier superman movies yet. And realised I don't have to. This movie deeply covers all the psychological aspects of superman as a living being.\n\nAnd for the people complaining about the cgi, must remember that this film belongs to the science fantasy genre...",
        "I watched this film back when it was first released in 2013, I thought it was too fast paced and incoherent. I just watched it again now in 2021 and I honestly don't know what frame of mind I was in back in 2013 when Man of Steel hit the screens...because this movie is friggin' AWESOME!! Maybe in 2013 I had bought into the critics unfair abuse they leveled upon this film, or maybe I was swayed by fanboy keyboard warriors who launched heaps of ill-will toward this film from their mom's basement because they didn't like Zack Snyder. Regardless, I was both wrong and stupid; this is hands down the best Superman movie made and Cavill is the best Superman since Christopher Reeve. Snyder, Nolan and Zimmer combine to make this film a visual, musical and story line driven classic.",
        "Such an amazing movie really hope he comes back to play another standalone man of steel 2",
        "It's got an absolutely incredible reinvention of Krypton as well s some brilliant flashbacks. Cavill nails the character and Shannon is just great as Zod. The action is well shot and is very easy to see, however the sheer amount of destruction does leave me wishing they'd toned it down. Still, Snyder understood the character well and I'd love to see a sequel someday.",
        "Fast paced, great action, and a great soundtrack. Never got the chance to see it in theaters, but watching it at home, it felt like the best DCEU movie I've seen till now (before Zack Snyder's Justice League).",
        "Superman has never been my favorite superhero. I didn't even like this movie until now. Don't judge me, but this is the first Superman movie I've watched, I haven't seen the originals yet. This movie is good, he fits the role of Henry very well, he sits down.",
        "Well whatever I write about it it's less coz I can't describe it in words how amazing this movie is especially the way Zack Snyder made this marvellous movie hats off to him. I am waiting for man of steel 2..",
        "I still couldn't understand why people hate this Kind of Cult Classical Adventure Superhero movie. Why We need to listen top critics Review...After all they don't even spent a single dollar. Audience is a great Critics instead of these Marvel Fanboy Critics.",
        "DCEU Stans here we cone!!! Best movie back in 2013.",
        "\"BEST SUPERMAN FILM EVER MADE\"\n\nThe epic masterpiece by auteur Zack Snyder, Man of Steel is an emotional journey that retells the classic Superman story with breathtaking visuals and wonderful acting.\n\nHans Zimmer's music is like the divine way to tell beautiful, poetic things to the heart.\n\nSpecial mentions for Ayelet Zurer and Diane Lane for their outstanding performance as Lara Lor-Van and Martha Kent respectively.",
        "I know that a lot of people don't like this movie, but I think that this movie is amazing. The action is spectacular, the story is great, the special effects are great, and the characters were great. People like to think of Henry Cavil's Superman as a depressing take on the character, but to be honest, that's not the kind of character he is in THIS movie, he didn't become depressing until BVS. Zod is one of the all-time great DC villains. you don't want Zod to succeed because it means the end of the human race, but at the same time you can understand why he's doing what he's doing. to me this movie isn't so much as a Superman movie as it is a Superman origin movie. This Superman makes mistakes because he's new to the job. I wish that we could've gotten more great Superman movies instead of that BVS movie that we got. but this is still a great movie.",
        "I have never been a hardcore superman fan, but I was fortunate enough to see an early showing of Zack Snyder's reboot. And I must say, I am quite impressed. Casual moviegoers and superhero fans will find something to enjoy. Man of Steel has great wreck- everything action that makes full use of 3D effects and simply looks awesome. The story is decently paced, and fueled by strong performances by Michael Shannon and Russell Crow(e). The character Perry White wasn't used to his full potential, but that's forgivable. If you're a fan of classic superman, you might be disappointed by the fact that this man of steel is pretty up- tight. He has only two or three lines that are humorous, making him less charming then the Christopher Reeve superman. The charm is replaced by the character development the man of steel experiences when he must choose between his past and his future. (that makes for an awesome showdown, by the way.) To summarize, I give Man of Steel an 8.6 for it's portrayal of a classic American hero.",
        "Man of Steel is filled to the top with epic action sequences as well as a sympathetic telling of Clark Kent's backstory on his journey to becoming \"Superman\". On top of that the film looks great which is unfortunately a rarity within this shared universe. General Zod and his people are also a major force to be reckoned with as they give Superman a run for his money leading up to the climax of the film. A worthy foe is definitely needed within a superhero film and General Zod is just that.",
        "This is my favorite CBM. I think the direction was perfect, it was a fantastic introduction for Henry's Superman. As a viewer something as simple like to see him at that time trying to find his place in the world even as good of a person as Superman hit close to home snd instilled me with hope that anyone of us could be as good as Superman.",
        "As a DC/Superman fan, I really love this film! Henry Cavil was perfect for Superman! It has great storyline, great messages, and I also loved Zod. If you're a huge Superman fan like I am, check out this movie.",
        "Watching 5th time ,never tired of watching again and again .best movie in super man ever .and probably one of best in superheroes.",
        "I have been a fan of Zack Snyder's work and when I heard he would be filling the director's shoes for Superman, I was excited. Man of Steel works at many levels. A solid story that starts from Krypton and ends at our world. One is made to feel like a Kryptonian more than a Earthling and the screenplay is very natural. I felt that the pacing was quite good and there was never a dull moment. The action is thick and realistic and you can expect a lot of destruction and havoc, but still befitting for a Superman movie. The casting was apt and Henry Cavill and Russel Crowe are the standouts but I will credit Zack for this movie's success and I hope WB persist with him for the sequel.",
        "The thing that threw me off the most was the Kryptonians acting too.. alien. From their ships down to their suits. I felt I was watching a UFO movie through a good part of it. True they're from another planet, but the stories I grew up with weren't all about them feeling like UFOs. Also Superman.. with facial hair? That threw me off too. Other than that there was a decent story and great special effects. The actor who played Zod was perfect for the role I feel. I was hoping they'd continue with another movie like Superman Returns, but I guess it's too late for that as they also put out Batman vs Superman after this.",
        "I was like most, I didn't appreciate this, when it came out. But I've watched it twice this year already (2022). It is brilliant. Such a great story line, great cast and the perfect superman.",
        "Learn how to make a realistic, dark and gritty movie about an almost invincible alien superhero from this one. Good acting, characters and story line, and an even better score and cinematography. Beware, since the movie diverts from the usual hopeful, naive, and positive superman, it's not well received by Hardcore fans of the symbol of hope. But if you're looking for a fresh and grounded take on him, you'll love this more than anything.",
        "This movie is just awesome with mind blowing action scenes.. Henry Cavill is great as Superman ..",
        "Director Zack Snyder has given its far best performance for directing this movie. From actors performance to the action sequences all is at it's best. Acting by the actors are brilliant to see. And the CGI is worth watching....",
        "The movie catch the Superman's essence very well. Is the road of Clark Kent searching his place in the world while he has a life among the humans. Zack Snyder gave us his own version of the character a little dark but how it has to be. At the end of all, this Superman movie is great, DC started perfect their universe. DC is the best.",
        "A hugely impressive and entertaining story of arguably the most powerful character in the superhero pantheon (and also one of the biggest pop culture icons), it's clear that the Man of Steel is here to stay. One of the best movies to enter the superhero genre. This movie is very nuanced and has so much heart. Despite the troubling criticism of DC/WB studios, this movie stands apart and is very well made. Henry Cavill does an absolutely phenomenal job in this film and fits the role so well. Henry Cavill does an absolutely phenomenal job in this film and fits the role so well. A fantastic Reboot of the story of earths most iconic superhero. Superb use of music creates the ambience that set the atmosphere for Superman's first fight in his journey to become earth's greatest hero. Witness how a itinerant worker is forced to accept his extraterrestrial heritage, when he fights to save the world which adopted him.",
        "UNDERRATED MASTERPIECE! First ever superman movie in which you will feel connected with the hero. Earlier supes were like some godly character, totally invincible. This supes is trying to find its place b/w ppl & society. Snyder did grt job in portrying this superman & Henry Cavill...if superman was real he would look like cavill, best EVER superman.",
        "This is most underrated Superhero origins movie... This is the first movie where they got Superman really right... Hats off to the director who made this Superman in real life and thought how he would behave in world like this... Really love the movie...",
        "This one has everything for a cool action movie. Action, drama, the right pace for a movie like that. I especially like that its so easy to re-watch. Zod is the villain but you can understand his motives.",
        "That's how superman movies should like, it has a very good story the characters The movement, it is really amazing surprise me\n\nJust tell me what's that you didn't like about it??",
        "This movie was ahead of its time. Awesome Action, different approach to Superman in Morden perspective and overall it's just a great film.",
        "Like his watchmen and 300, Snyder's vision only includes the visuals and violence. His compulsion to put ideas before any heart or emotion costs him again. Yes it's watchable, it's visuals are great, the action, the score, is phenomenal. Especially the action. But Snyder fails to keep a grip on the story rendering it uneven for most parts and only seems to have a grip when the action begins or the visuals enroll. He tries and just passes to make a competent film overall, but we expected better in terms of character and story maybe he isn't the right one for the job Watch it purely for its visual greatness.",
        "A decent movie and a great story and everything is just fantastic from the beginning to the end was thrilling And yeah best superman and best superman movie",
        "This was meant to be an origin story for superman and it gave exactly that. It showed how modern society would react if an alien was to show up in today's society. Also it was extremely realistic and showed exactly what would happen if 2 God like beings would fight one another. This movie was ahead of its time and zack snyder is one hell of an artist.",
        "This is my most favorite comic book movie, and damm how Henry Cahill did that role , he just lived it. Special mention to story by Nolan, not typical superman story. Story of a different guy learning his identity, fighting for his people. Zack Snyder directs it with so much love you can see it.",
        "So disappointed in this movie. I listened to Kevin Costner and trusted his assessment. I guess he couldn't bash a movie he was in. Way too much brutal force and destruction in this for me. Some call this high action. But it was so senselessly destructive. Chucks of cities destroyed, animals and people had to be swept away in all the blasting of towering buildings. I wanted to get out of this one about half way into it. Ongoing destruction! Admittedly, I'm not an action movie fan, but I love the Iron Man movies. I felt I was doing more analyzing than watching during this monstrosity. It was increasingly annoying to me. What was ever wrong with the Superman we knew! Whether it be George Brent or Christopher Reeves. They where enchanting. The actors were great. It was the storyline that was troubling. My goodness! where was the story! Over and over monotonous plot. And you definitely see this was only a teaser for the next 3 sequels$$$$$$ Well, $12 for 3D garage--one time is more than enough for me. PLEASE Iron Man do NOT take anything from this garbage!",
        "First 1h Goes in a light speed ! Next it slightly slows down ! But anyway, Enjoyed the Film! Loved the Characters chosen for this movie ! Amy adams, Beautiful and did the job perfectly ! Superman steals the show ! WORTH A WATCH !!!!",
        "I've been extremely blown away after years passed by from it's release.. The first time I watched it, I was only interested on a popcorn flick style. Years later after watching some Nolan films. I started appreciating the man of steel more and more and more..",
        "The effects , the direction, the story is mind blowing. Dont listen to critics. This is such a masterpiece. Hands down",
        "The movie is extraordinary. Don't know why people hate on this movie, but this is the best movie of the dceu for me. From the score to the cgi and direction this one is good on all aspects.please watch it if you haven't.",
        "I've always thought of Superman as a lame old timey overpowered character that wasn't interesting. I've always been a Batman and Ironman type. But this movie was really enjoyable. It covered origin and the beginning of Superman in a interesting and entertaining way. I've always hated Superman as he's pretty much invincible. But this movie evened the odds with Gen Zod and his own kind. Overall, very good movie that was enjoyable to watch. Henry was a great fit.",
        "I praised the film's musical score, amazing visuals, the dark tone, amazing acting performances done by all cast, Zack synder is too good.",
        "It was such an underrated movie. Well written and produced. Just watched again. What a movie",
        "Of the Henry cavill Superman movies and honestly any of the last 15-20 year Superman movies. This one is by far one of the most interesting plots for a start up new Superman series of movies. Even after he joined forces with Batman and the rest of the hero's, nothing beats a good a start up movie. And this one is well worth seeing!! You won't be disappointed! If you have an imagination and enjoy getting into a movie then you will leave this one with great feelings of excitement and want more!!!",
        "Man of Steel is the best Superman movie I've seen, it has a great cast, good acting, and great action. It's not perfect, the colors are too dark, they could've used a bit more humor and there was too much collateral damage in the final act. Overall my favorite DCEU movie, and a top 10 comic book movie.",
        "To be frank, the soundtrack is perfection! The drums and the horns hit so hard! This movie would be a 6 or less if the music didn't get me so amped and emotional. But this is not the case, it is so memorable and powerfully hits the feels throughout the movie.\n\nThis is the kind of movie that you need to watch on a big screen with some really good speakers or you miss out on it's awesomeness.\n\nThe opening act in this film is one of my all time favourites. I love the sci-fi feel to it. The part where russel crow walks out and you behold the grand battle that is taking place is absolutely majestic and awesome! The cgi in this movie hasn't aged a bit! It looks just as good what comes out today.\n\nI could honestly go on and on about how great this movie is.",
        "This is the best Superman we have had and probably the best we'll get",
        "One of the best superhero movies, it deserves ten stars because of the beautiful and fun action scenes and the story is also beautiful. Thank you Zack Snader and thank you DC.",
        "It's not perfect but it's a dang good movie. Cavill is ideal for the role and the rest of the cast is solid. The movie drags on a bit but it's finally a Superman movie worth your time.",
        "Loved the backstory, the action scenes are amazing and fitting for the the most powerful beings in the universe. Acting was too notch. Music and cinematography amazing. The kind of movie I can watch multiple times. I don't get the hate on this film.",
        "My mom took me to Superman 2 when I was a child. Much love to Christopher Reeves. Then they reboot it with Brandon Routh and I enjoyed it but it was apparent the studio took over to homogenize it. That and Kevin spacey is a piece of garbage. Henry Cavill crushed this roll, and Michael Shannon is a born villain.",
        "Been a Superman fan ever since i saw Donner's first Superman movie as a kid. ever since then Supermen movies were having remakes and i still loved them, but not as much as i loved Man Of Steel. this movie turned me into a huge fan, it gave me Superman's perspective, to see how it was like to him to have his powers and how to use them in the right way. loved this movie a lot. Zack Snyder knew exactly what he was doing with this character!",
        "Man of Steel is a solid movie! The movie is as solid as the title. The acting and directing, and plot was flawless. The actors where unknown, but the Superman character was believable, while the Lois character was likable but feisty. The directing was fast paced, but slow in spots, mostly flashbacks for character and plot development. There is a biblical themed sub plots: The Clark character living on the earth but not of it. One willing to sacrifice for mankind. There are beings out there which hate and will destroy mankind. A strong story of understanding, sacrifice, and living by one's beliefs. Man of Steel is a strong eight out of ten.",
        "Man of Steel deserves a trilogy. It is so good. Period.",
        "This film will age marvelously. Complex, deep, challenging - it's not for the faint of heart. At last, a superhero film that lives up to the potential of the comics medium. High praise for the intricate world Snyder and Goyer created.",
        "I mean, this movie is not perfect but even IGN will tell u that it's better than 7/10!\n\nIt's a good superhero movie beginning a new generation of DC movies.",
        "This is definitely the best-looking Superman in history. Although there is a slight flaw in the plot, the Star Warriors will completely kill the Superman in the back.",
        "I'm a huge Snyder fan therefore I gave this a chance. This film has so much heart and expansion yet true to source material .\n\nGreat film and well done Mr Snyder!!\n\nI'm a Superman fan now \ud83d\ude00",
        "Zack Snyder's vision for superhero movies is captivating. This movie is far greater from the original Superman movies.",
        "After eight years, I finally gave it a second chance, and boy, oh boy, it deserved that second chance.",
        "This is a great superhero movie but does not set up a universe in any way, it is also too dark to be a superman movie. But besides that it is a great movie. I think Zack Snyder is not the man to make a superman movie as his movies tend to be dark, but I would give it a solid 8/10",
        "I'm not going to lie... I went in expecting to hate this movie thinking it was just another emo super hero movie that wasn't going to deliver. I saw it and overall I thought it was an enjoyable movie... I actually liked Jar El in a movie for a change. Was it overly dark, maybe a bit, but it was an enjoyable story where superman had a worthy adversary.... the plot didn't need kryptonite or make it feel like superman was holding back too much... The biggest issue I had was Jonathan Kent... he felt like the anti uncle Ben... he was there to be a downer to Clark up until a tornado took him away to that Oz beyond the stars. But as far as the villains go, I'd say I'm a big fan of Terrance Stamp particularly in the Zod role... but this Zod was enjoyable. Did it feel like it was trying to add preachier and deeper stuff not needed in a superman movie? maybe... but it was still a move you could eat popcorn while watching and not leave thinking... \"this was stupid\" granted I know quite a few out there did.",
        "Why so much hatred.. Believe me.. That's the most underrated superhero movie of all time.. That first flight scene is way better than the whole MCU altogether.",
        "This is the best superman film, easily. Great cast, animations, writing and art design.\n\nOf all the comic book films of recent years this one stands above the others for me.\n\nWe don't have to deal with a cheap joke every other line.\n\nThe action scenes are carefully choreographed rather than about 30-40 minutes of drawn out slug fest.\n\nThey respect the source material and do a good job of explaining it.\n\nAll in all its a great comic book film. However, as usual, if it doesn't appeal to young teens it won't rate highly.",
        "Jack Snyder's fresh take on Superman/Man of Steel is... fresh indeed. A superhero movie that maxes visual wizardry but beautifully balanced by emotional tones without feeling heavy. Gone is the sleek metal and crystal polish we have known replaced by a techno- organic theme (reminds me of Prometheus) that is both regal and advanced. This is perhaps the only Superman film with the best narrative of the Kryptonian's heritage and history. Good casting and an impressive performance by Russell Crowe. I give it an 8.5/10 (just behind Dark Knight Rises IMHO). The Dad in me deems this movie watchable by kids (more age-appropriate, less violent than Iron Man 3)",
        "This movie is No.1 film in my heart.I wish WB can make a Zack Snyder's Justice League 2&3 ,and make Zack Snyder's universe happened!!!!!!!!",
        "I just love Henry Cavill. He done his work with perfection. Love this movie one of my favourite superhero.",
        "A very underrated movie. Nice plot, nice pacing.\n\nIt's very inspirational.",
        "I think this film is one of the best superman films ever and the second best DCEU film after Aquaman, it transforms superman from a superhero for babies with crap dialogue ( \" stop right there evildoer\" \"I will stop you robber\") to a superman for teenagers which is a great result and his origin fits perfectly. Pros-greatly visualised fight scenes. Extremely great ending. Entertaining. Great new personality change of superman Awesome music. Tells superman's origin story in the best, most efficient way.\n\nCons-They should have found some other way to defeat Zod except for getting him killed by KAL. Clark does not change his personality from a tough guy to a wimp as Clark Kent to keep his secret identity.\n\nBut the movie is so good that I don't care a about the cons, its still great.",
        "This is not only the best superman movie and the most realistic alien invasion ever, but also it is the greatest original story to ever take place in Hollywood.",
        "Henry Cavill is by far the best superman EVER!!! I know a lot of people say Christopher reeves was the best. He wasn't the best, he was just the first. So everyone after him is compared to him. But Henry Cavill is so far superior to him Christopher reeve isn't even in the same league.",
        "Finally!! A Superman movie that truly lives up to the potential of the character. Big ideas, big action, and a big emotional journey. Films should challenge you, and this one certainly does.",
        "Superman is one of the best comic character in every way . I've always loved him. over the years I've watched many Superman movies but none was close to the version I've always pictured him. But after watching Man of steel this is the best of best Superman movie I've ever watched. It is so realistic in every way. It shows if Superman was real in the world we're living in and how powerful these god beings can be in a world like ours. The movie shows the two sides of Superman perfectly. The smiling side and struggling side. Trying to find his place in a totally strange world with powers enough to level that world. The cinematography was used in the best way you could ask. So an inspirational movie. Watching this movie, again and again, makes you realize some people hate it only because of personal issues. There's absolutely nothing to hate it. A Ture Superman Movie. Movies' tone, visuals, soundtrack, story, performance, thriller, and actions are so good in every way. This deserves a sequel directed by the same director.",
        "Man of steel is the story of Superman shown through a series of flashbacks and his reveal to the world. The movie is not a typical marvel movie (which I am not condemning) but rather it is trying to take a new take on superhero's and classic stories through camera work, soundtrack, and showing the superhero world isn't black and white. The movies visuals are interesting and personally I liked them but I see how the shaking camera style is not for all. The character development was not ordinary but through flash backs showing Clark grow over the years and the plot is showing the out come of his growth. This is not an ordinary film but a special one That shows that DC is complex and a new take on comic book movies",
        "This is definitely the best superman i have seen if you see it.",
        "I really liked it. It has a lot of action and adventure. This is a kind of superheroe movie that is amazing. From DC.",
        "Excellent movie. Totally reenergized the franchise, which was almost sunk after the horrible \"Superman Returns\" (2006), which you should avoid seeing at all costs. That movie was made by people who despise Superman and hoped to destroy him and everything noble and honorable that he stood for. \"Man of Steel\" (2013) was the best Superman movie to date, great on multiple levels--plot, acting, SFX, filmography, musical score, message, etc. That's saying a lot, because I did believe that \"a man can fly\" when I saw the first Reeves movie 4 times in the theater way back in '78.",
        "Awesome story along with visual effects. the start of the DCEU. The soundtrack is amazing. Strongly recommend watching if you like superhero movies!!",
        "I fell for the buildup hype so much that I went to the \"just after midnight\" sneak-peek. And after the film was done, I was left with one suspicion - that the reason there weren't more characters in the film is because David S. Goyer (screenplay) must have run out of cardboard from which to cut them.\n\nAction movie fans may like the action sequences in this film. But I felt no sympathy for any character. It was almost as if I was watching an old-style movie about zombies ... trudging through their roles until the movie reached its conclusion. Normally, I doze off during soulless films like this. But, I forced myself to stay awake ... hoping to catch even a glimpse of \"depth\" or \"flesh\" given to any character. Didn't work.",
        "When they say it's the best superman movie, I believe them. Christopher Nolan truly went nuts writing it. I love the way they characterise Clark and everyone in it. MoS deserves more appreciation.",
        "I don't know why this movie is getting hate despite a different superhero story approach. Clearly showing the audience the ups and downs he went through while he's growing up.especially the character evolution blew my mind .this is personally my opinion while watching the movie.",
        "People hated it because of a lot of reasons. Which you can find here. But all those are explained if you just think a little bit. There's countless essays on this movie on YouTube.",
        "The best origin story for superman! The bestest direction amd you get a amazing story line!",
        "1: Henry cavill is a greatest actor in hollywood 2: while Zack Snyder is the legendary director 3: Christopher Nolan's storyline...",
        "This was a great movie, I would see it again in a heartbeat.\n\nIts completely different from any Superman you've seen before this, so go in with an open mind. I have to be honest, i went into this movie not expecting much since it got so many bad reviews, but don't listen to them, they're dumb. BEST Superman so far. There was a TON of action, some of it may look a little \"Mortal Combat-ish\" because of the super fast movement and fighting. I don't want to give anything away but we'll just say they added some \"space stuff\" and it was awesome. thats where i think it differs greatly from the other superman's. but they didn't ruin it with that by any means, in fact i wish they could make a prequel off of this haha! The actors chosen for their roles were perfect. Henry Cavill is the absolute best choice for this, Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner played their roles great, the actors were chosen well. All around a great movie",
        "This movie is awesome. Top notch acting and the cinematography and music are amazing. Visually, this is one of the most stunning movies I've ever seen as well. Only to be out done by it's sequel. The controversial ending... kind of dumb that people have an issue with it. Remember Superman 2???????",
        "The story behind this is amazing the actors are fenomenal dramatic and action on its pick #RestoreTheSnyderverse #HenryCavillSuperman #BenAffleckbatman #RayFisherisourcyborg #EzraMillerisourflash #GalHadot #UsUnited #ForAutumn #Bringback.",
        "Great movie. Cast are spot on. Illustrated the best potential of human genuinely. Which was further amplify by Hans Zimmer sound track. Amazing movie. Sad that it didn't lead to further sequels.",
        "Everything about this movie is great. I don't know what the critics were thinking at the time. Henry Cavill as superman is great. Michael Shannon as the villain is flawless.",
        "I saw this movie on a long seven hour flight from Beijing to Doha. What I needed was to pass the time and to be entertained. This movie does that! It is entertaining, interesting and holds your attention.\n\nHenry C for the role of Superman is a great choice. He is damn hot in the movie. Shirtless or fully dressed. As for Amy A - this is the first movie that I have seen of hers. And she was good. I was kinda surprised to see Kevin C in a movie ( don't know why). And especially his role of Superman's father. What I did not like was his overprotective/moral role to the young Superman - it is kinda clich\u00e9 and useless in my opinion. Young Supermen were good too.\n\nAll in all, not a bad movie if you seek only something to entertain you. My rating is eight!",
        "Man Of Steel is the best movie I have ever seen. It was emotional and beautiful and taught many valuable lessons in life. They really show an epic Superman.",
        "Good:\n\nDark and realistic take on Superman's origin story. General Zod is a great villain. Supporting characters like Jor-El and Jonathan Kent were very good as well. Amazing visual effects which contain one of the best and breath-taking superhero fight scenes of all-time. The movie succeeds in almost every level in doing justice to a Superman movie.\n\nBad:\n\nA few forgettable side characters.",
        "Just like Iron Man with the MCU, Man of Steel delivers a good starting point for the DCEU. It doesn't instantly want to make it clear that is part of a shared universe which is where Iron Man succeeded, only focusing on the hero who's name is in the title.\n\nMan of Steel is an interesting origin story of Superman as Earth truly sees him in the spotlight but it can feel quite boring in parts throughout the movie.",
        "Great film-making. Superb cast. Wonderful screenplay. Decent dialogues. Heavy action. Splendid visual spectacle.\n\nHenry Cavill does a wonderful job. So does Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner. Even the smaller, not-so-important-to-the-plot characters are given something useful to do (rather than staring at the fights and giving 'suitable' expressions). Amy Adams is believable and cute.\n\nThe Superman that we all wanted to see brought to life through a great effort by everyone.\n\nMan of Steel is to Superman what Batman Begins was to Batman. Need I say more?",
        "\"Man of Steel\" attempts to rejuvenate its hero with a whole lot of big ideas stuffed into a dense assemblage that alternates between visual wizardry and non-linear plot ingredients. Snyder has turned the Superman narrative into yet another modern day blockbuster. By the end, Henry Cavill's subdued performance in the lead role is the sole element of this film. \"Man of Steel\" is certainly the most dazzling Superman movie to hit the big screen. David Goyer's screenplay establishes a high stakes showdown between Superman and General Zod.\n\n143-minutes is also one of the longest movies, and justifies that heft because of the heft. \"Man of Steel\" attempts to tell two stories at once with an overlapping structure that would make \"Lost\" creators swoon. Snyder's film lacks any sense of Superman's personality; he's just another fancy effect from his bag of tricks. The movie's, after promising earlier bits drop off to make room for the extravagant conclusion.",
        "This movie is still one of the best fight in superhero genre. I feel attach to henry cavill superman.",
        "This will be a short review, all I have to say about this movie is that it was espectacuar... I just love everything on it... Since the start to the end. The movie peace is great, you'll never get bored, since this films tells in a different and more grounded way how Kal-El grew up and the struggles he went for through his life. I loved the way they showed Krypton, I felt like finally I was watching a comic book coming to life on the big screen! BEAUTIFUL. Rich in story, an outstanding start to what it would be hopefully a new trilogy. Excellent performances, Michael Shannon and Henry Cavill are incredible. THE ACTION. BEST ACTION EVER! I MEAN, EVER! BEST SUPERMAN FILM YET. And possibly one of the best superhero movies ever made till date. Just right behind TDR & TDRS. We'll have to see how things go, and expect another wonderful movie if not a better one! Can't wait! 9/10",
        "Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner as fathers are brilliant! Most underrated movie !!!",
        "The 1st act of the movie is probably the best first act of any superhero origin movie has ever but out just the sheer visuals and emotional depth it had humanised superman and I could feel the pain and alienated feeling Clark has and my god the cinematography and music are best aspect of it. Defiantly it was ahead of its time People didn't like the done of the movie but for me it was best part",
        "The story line of this movie is what i found very entertaining.",
        "8/10 - I liked the visual effects and the idea that we humans are afraid from those who are different..",
        "Best movie i seen ever.many people want man of steel 2 movie,i agree. Man of steel 2 Needed.",
        "This movie has so much to offer. Watching it in 2021, it could have turned the future of DC Universe. WB could have make a fortune out of it. Talking about the movie, it has the best plot, explanation of how Kryptonian came to Earth and what happened to Krypton. Russel Crowe was fantastic all the time. And so was Michael Shanon as General Zod. And for us Henry Cavil is going to be the Superman of our era. I hope they never replace him. The visual effects, the colour and all that flying and crashing through the building was perfectly done. The whole movie could go on another level on next sequel which is never going to happen.",
        "Too much destruction, Too much CGI,Poor dialog,Uninteresting story and characters. Maybe the director & studio wanted to outdone the standard put by Micheal Bay's TRANSFORMERS Films. Even the new Superman theme sucked, Hans Zimmer provided a lame score compared to his iconic theme for BATMAN.\n\nAnything good was from Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. And also the FIRST HALF with stunning VFX scenery. This is totally 70's Superman with steroids. Not a Reboot, just VFX mockery.\n\nYeah I'm done with Superman. Batman got the best reboot in cinematic history, I don't think anything can compare.\n\nI give this movie 1 out of 10.",
        "I had the good fortune of being one of the very first Superman fans to watch Man of Steel (the movie started showing here in the Philippines today, June 12, which happens to be our country's Independence Day). The timing of the first screening day is just perfect because it's a holiday here in our country (was expecting for long queues so I decided to watch the very first screening, and in 3D, to boot).\n\nWhat can I say? Man of Steel sure lived up to all the (good) hype. This is the first time I'm posting a review here (and I sure am no movie expert), so I'll defer the real reviews to the pros.\n\nI will just say this: if you love Superman, action, and a very cohesive storyline that's unique but doesn't depart from the Superman fundamentals, you're going to have one heck of a ride. It's a different league (no pun) altogether.",
        "Man of Steel is one of the best superman movie I have watched. I don't know why so much hate to it. If you haven't watched it yet, I would recommend you to watch it.",
        "Certainly the best Superman film of our generation. Zack Snyder, cast and crew craft an origin film unlike any other dealing with themes of doubt, loss, purpose, and choice in this immigrant story because yes, Superman is an immigrant. Clever and bold choices, beautiful cinematography by Amir Mokri, and a grand, humble yet heroic score from Hans Zimmer. This film will be discussed in years to come.",
        "Man... this is a how a super hero movie should be it's perfect.",
        "Actions were spectacular and the casting was right on point. Plot/characters/visuals were all great. Very enjoyable.",
        "This movie was surely ahead of its time. The action was violent & this is what Comic book films need. Show the reality of Invasion, not jokes in the middle of an Invasion. The music was godly, well, its Hans Zimmer.\n\nWelcome to the Planet.",
        "Or shady expectations. Far from being a critic myself, this seemed to me to be one of the best superhero depictions, right there with Nolan's Batman. It had substance. You felt how powerful those beings are just by watching them standing in front of each other. The fights were like the riff accompanying a low death metal growl. In the end, it's clearly a matter of taste, given mostly by the audience. Latest Marvel movies are complete trash, a waste of hundreds of millions of dollars. But clearly, that is not true with the intended audience, who rated them that high.",
        "I've watched the original 1978 film and the others. I've waited a long time to see a remaking of another Superman film. When I watched this, the experience was epic and thrilling. I liked the action and the emotional scenes. They did a great job of designing Henry's suit and I liked the design. Amy Adams was excellent playing Lois Lane. General Zod's character was very dark and I liked it.\n\nFor the upcoming DC films, I don't know what to expect and they're casting someone else to play Superman.",
        "I don't understand why DC has so much hate... I love it more than Marvel. It's just more realistic and dark. This movie is simply the best superman movie I've seen. And I saw them all. It's such a realistic view on superman's story. Not a fairy tale and not the typical hero, just a regular guy trying to do his best with what he has. I guess many of us can relate to that, even if he has more abilities than us. He struggles with the need to react against bullies while hiding who he is.",
        "Its official. The critics are crazy,this film is a work of art from a master director. An amazing film in all its honesty. Henry cavill potrays superman better than anyone has ever done before. The action sequences, the story, the charachter development is to die for, i still watch this and am intriguid everytime, i highly recommend this,",
        "Henry Cavill IS Superman. The story is totally believable for today and has depth beyond a normal comic book flick. It's almost 10 years. WB stop the nonsense and make Man of Steel 2.",
        "This is must watch film. You don't need to have any Superman comic knowledge to understand this. There is a lot to explore this character and story. #DC.",
        "This film is so Underrated, amazing movie with an great story.",
        "When I first watched this, I didn't finish it because I found the build up and flashbacks and exploring Superman's past and beginnings somewhat tedious. So, I made up my mind that I wouldn't bother finishing, though I found Russell Crowe's character excellent. But then my siblings started to watch it, so I thought I would give it a second chance. And I'm glad I did. While I didn't get to see the middle, I got to see the climax. And it's freaking awesome! It has great tension, an awesome villain, spectacular special effects (amongst the best I've seen), fantastic musical score. There were several times I thought 'this is the end', but it turned out that there was still more to go. And it doesn't disappoint. Very satisfying. The acting is top notch and I think the person who does Superman does him wonderfully, possibly perfectly, though I can't judge that as this is the first Superman movie that I've seen and I've never read any of the comics. Fantastic, fantastic movie.",
        "Can't believe the high IMDb score on this one to be honest. I was very disappointed with this film. It starts off OK with Krypton, and the early part on Earth is OK-ish, but about half of the film is one long moronic punch-up. Invulnerable people hitting each other seemingly endlessly does not a dramatic encounter make. Superman gets punched, flies back into building which is demolished. Gets up as he's invulnerable. He punches person who punched him, who flies back into building which is demolished. Gets up as he's invulnerable. Repeat for 2nd half of film. The next film I viewed was Watchmen. The comparison with such a rich packed storyline just threw into sharp contrast the wasteland which is the Man of Steel script.",
        "I just loved the movie... Apart from the dark theme and CGI heavy action scenes other things like origin, Motivations, Childhood, Chemistry with Louis are just perfect... 10/10",
        "Man of Steel is a coming of age movie to the misfit. Clark like most people don't know what to do with his life and search for meaning after arriving on Earth. The first Superman movie to make Superman actually uses his powers in a combative way, great actions sequences by Zack Snyder and performances from Henry Cavil and all the cast. The movie is a complete deconstruction of the super hero, Clark doesn't wake up and decides to be a super hero for no reason, he walks the hero's journey and that is a great first step.",
        "This is the most underrated movie.\n\nIt's a beauty.... How neatly messages are conveyed in this film \" how the strongest man adapted in this world went through the worst and still didn't lose his calm\" Henry Cavill is the one and only fit for this role I am more of a Marvel fan but I have to admit the fact that even Marvel can't beat the level of casting of DC especially Superman (Henry Cavill) and wonder woman\n\nThis movie is a masterpiece and so is the soundtrack .. Don't just rely on the review go and watch it urself.",
        "This is the best Superman movie ever zack Snyder is the best director ever I love this movie so much I can't stop watching this movie",
        "I'm being pretty honest, I've liked Superman before but this version of him made me love him. With time everything evolves, so does how people perceive if they figured out an alien among them. This movie amazingly describes the origin story for a superhero and it's the best origin story so far I've seen. The background music, the character development, supporting cast, the fight scenes, the parent child relationship. Awe! I have watched this movie over a 100 times now and still would love to watch it anytime.",
        "I rewatch this movie twice a year. Every time, I pick up some new piece of awesomeness I didn't notice before. True creativity coming from every direction. This is how you do cinema.",
        "I love Superman. Love all the films - even the ones I know are bad. I never thought I'd be surprised by a Superman movie - yet here we are. Incredible film from start to finish. Really made me feel engrossed in the cinematic experience - something I find harder and harder to do anymore. 11/10 all the way. Give this film an honest shot - and #ReleaseTheSnyderCut",
        "No contest. I enjoy all of the Superman movies - even Superman IV - but this film finally lives up to the potential of the character. Big ideas for a larger than life hero. Challenges you. Makes you think. Just like a good story should.",
        "If there is a single movie that i repeat watch every now and then, that has to be MOS. Incredible visual and breathtaking cinematography. Extremely engaging storyline and Hans Zimmer's masterpiece. I believe this movie was ahead of time. 100 years from now , people will still be talking highly about this beauty of a film. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udd25 IN SNYDER WE TRUST.",
        "One of the greatest films.. I was connected to this film after some time Needed a sequel.",
        "This is a truly excellent film, the way its shot, the great acting, the immense special effects, the way it starts! I can't praise this film enough, Henry Cavill is brilliant as the man of steel. He is the best actor to play superman, he is definitely on par with Christopher Revee. There a lot of hero films these days and a lot of them are quite simimliar in their execution but man of steel brilliantly different and unique.\n\nThere will never be a better superman film.",
        "Man of Steel was the greatest Superman movie ever made. The sound effects were amazing, the soundtrack was beautiful, and the settings looked real.\n\nHenry Cavill who played \"Clark Klent\" was the best Superman in the Superman franchise and his suit looked better too. Amy Adams who played \"Lois Lane\" did a great job of playing that character. Michael Shannon who played \"General Zod\" was a tough super villain that almost defeated Superman. Russell Crowe who played Superman's father, \"Jor-El\" was the wisest character in the movie.\n\nThe fight scenes were amazing, the spaceships looked real, and the ending was great.\n\nThey've FINALLY made a great Superman movie.",
        "There is a reason why superman has persisted as one of the most recognizable superheroes of all time and that is, because the character changes as society does as well. Man of steel perfectly encapsulates that thought. While not as cheery as the Christopher Reeves films, Man of Steel is still a joy to sit through and as someone who has watched this movie multiple times, I still enjoy sitting through this movie with each viewing. The action is top-notch, each of the main characters (with the exception Pa Kent) is very well written and well acted, and apart from the ending arc which is a bit too much, it is fantastic in every other category. You need to watch this movie because in my opinion it is one of the better superhero movie out there and something everyone should give a chance to. This is after all, Superman we are talking about.",
        "Undoubtedly the best superhero movie ever. This movie is the perfect analogy of how a superhero will be treated by the present world. Very realistic and not the cheesy cliches that you see in other movies. The soundtrack is epic and fits well. So many motivating qoutes which show how an alien is shaped into the selfless human superhero that we adore. The problem with the haters is that they want an established Superman and not an origin movie. DO NOT listen to the critics on this one and miss out on this epic masterpiece.",
        "Man of steel. It's a very mixed bag. But if you get through all the negativity and actually watch the movie for what It truly is, then your in for a treat! This was the first film in what was \"Zack Snyder's DC story arc\" and pretty much the film to kick of the DCEU! It explores a small part of Clark's Smallville life and then we begin to adventure into Clark's older life and Superman. You would truly expect for the best parts to be only Superman's parts, but it's not the best part. The best part, is how this film actually takes the time to focus on all characters and build them up slowly, but when we finally get to Superman it's pretty straight forward from there! Not saying it's bad after he's finally introduced, as a matter of fact it only gets better from here on out! In conclusion I recommend you see it for yourself and voice your opinion.",
        "I honestly was very impressed with this film. The film builds on Clark Kent/kal-el (Henry Cavill) finding his calling,He struggles with his differences but does want to help humanity, the movie is a great story for Superman, it has beautiful visuals showing the world of Krypton from a movie aspect we've never seen, along with engaging fights and an amazing story. Highly recommended!",
        "In my opinion this is the best superman movie yet.",
        "It's good not amazing but good it's a bit too serious but it's good but it's good it's dramatic and epic but it's good",
        "I don't get the negative critical reviews for this movie. Yes, the tone is dark and brooding. It's merely a different take on the Superman character. I don't feel Zack Snyder is going all \"Dark Knight\" on us with this version. His vision of Krypton and Clark growing up on earth is fantastic. I also love how the story is told through flashbacks instead of a linear timeline. The special effects are fantastic, and I think the score is one of my favorite superhero scores of all time. The movie is perfectly cast. Henry Cavill is the first actor, IMO, that looks like he stepped off the pages of a comic book. He, along with Chris Hemsworth, look like they were made for their roles. I've seen this movie a dozen times and it never gets old.",
        "Watching this almost 9 years later, this film was very underrated. I have always preferred this movie over Superman(1978) which obviously is also a great film. This has to be a top 3 DCEU film.",
        "If you want just to have fun and thrill this a go to movie. Henry cavill is best superman. Amy Adams great as lois lane. Buildup is the story with flashbacks is great. Fights are intriguing. A must watch.",
        "Sit back. Enjoy. This is what movie substance should be. Cinematic maturity.",
        "Despite some negative responses to the movie by critics and fans alike, I enjoyed Zach Snyder's darker take on Superman. The movie struggles at times with pacing and narrowing down on a theme, but the tone is very consistent, and I think actually complements the story quite well. All the characters are engaging, and the villain is superb. Not to mention the action in this movie is colossal! Man of Steel may not be the perfect Superman movie, but it sure is not a bad one either. Man of Steel gives gritty, pulse pounding action that all other Superman films up to this point kind of lacked, bringing the Man of Steel into the more modern mature age of superhero films.",
        "In my oppinion; This movie the best of the superman series.",
        "I wish I could burn this film from my memory for real. I'm seriously not kidding. I really don't know how to describe the dread I felt within the first half hour when I knew this was as bad as others had warned me it would be and even worse than most critics said it would be. It really was beyond cringe worthy and those space ships. Don't even get me started. I expected Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith to come crawling out of one with cigars in their mouth. Something blows up. A bunch of blurry images zoom by and then it starts again. And repeat. And repeat. Rinse and repeat. That's how I feel trying to wash out the bad taste this film left behind. Nolan should stick to directing and not producing. Snyder and David Goyer need to launch themselves into space so this planet never again has to be subjected to anything this illogical and monotonous.",
        "6 years have past and this is still the best movie coming out of the DCEU. Wonder Woman and Shazam are in very close contention. But this film was supposed to be Iron Man; a good start to a great cinematic run by the MCU. This film gave the DCEU promise and Warner/Snyder/everyone involved let the potential fade. Nolan with fantastic writing. Crowe, Cavill and Michael Shannon played their roles extremely well. Such great potential. I PRAY for MoS part 2 soon",
        "This reboot and the start Of DCEU Universe was perfect but we need a second part",
        "Amei esse filme, trilogy os Zack Snyder's Justice League!!!",
        "I grew up in the 60's and really learned to read from Superman comics and as a lifelong devotee I must say that this film gets it right. It really reaches the depth of Kal El and I have to disagree with all the negativity thrown it's way. Well acted, filmed and told.",
        "Wow, the special effects in this movie are phenomenal. You can certainly tell they put a lot of money into it. It really paid off as it makes for a great action movie. Don't listen to the critics as Man of Steel is about entertainment and it does exactly that. Although the overall tone of the film is much darker than previous versions which is a little depressing and Amy Adams was quite possibly the worst choice for Lois Lane but other than that it is a great movie.\n\nI feel like this version of Superman has never been told before. It doesn't feel stale and \"done before\" but instead offers a new take on a very familiar subject. It's no shiny saviour story, it shows how toxic fear and prejudice really can be. It probably didn't need to be quite so long to send that message but it fills the time adequately nevertheless.\n\nSo watch and enjoy it for what it is, the cast is more than enough reason.",
        "This is near perfect DCEU movie . It balances DC's dark theme and colorful emotions. Cavil is totally the best Superman for now. The theme ,soundtrack, everything was on point. We need more Snyder and Nolan.",
        "One of the most underrated films of the decade. Breath-taking visuals and action ahead of its time for a Comic film. For me the film hits on all cylinders. I believe this film gives us the most realistic adaptation of Superman and what he's truly capable of. Michael Shannon's performance as General Zod is phenomenal and I don't think they could've chosen a better actor for the role. To cap it all off Hans Zimmer delivers another masterpiece of a score to make this film one of my favorites of all-time.",
        "Jesus wasn't Jesus for that matter. Characters should have depth, struggle, question and strive for something. People seem to want Superman to be born perfect and popping golden poopies. That's not storytelling - that's a poster. If you want narrative - the most interesting narrative are the ones of extreme contrast and large character strides. This is Superman for the true fans. Those who sit around the bar at night and debate issues of philosophy, mythology and narrative decisions. Not for those who are in to \"pew pew - action action.\" Zack Snyder was brilliant, and one day you'll realize how lucky you were.",
        "Henry Cavill is the best superman! This movie is fantastic!",
        "After the last epic fail movie of Superman, \"Superman Returns\" which i did not like came out this movie which I think that it was a great movie, with good visual effects and the nice interpretation of Henry Cavill who plays as Clark Kent / Kal-El (Superman).\n\n\"Man of Steel\" is a really good movie which shows us with different perspective the life of Superman and his evolution from Clark Kent to Kal-El and then Superman. I also liked in this movie that showed us how the life of Clark Kent changed and many times with many details. That was something that I found it really good because it did not leave gaps in the film and also in the story of Superman in general.",
        "I love this movie so much is so special for me. I still remember the day that I went to the theater like it was yesterday. This movie is great the cast and hans zimmer did one of the most beautiful soundtracks that I ever heard. 2013 an unforgettable year for me.",
        "The new version of Superman, like the beginning of the DC Extended Universe, is completely an all in one deal, they knew that maybe they wouldn't have the opportunity to make sequels out of it, but they played all the cards on the table and won. Man of Steel fails because of the quick pace in which they want to tell the story, causing very forced situations between characters, and having an abrupt and anticlimactic ending. The action scenes are simply amazing, its excessive use of CGI manages to transmit each impact, accompanied by the master Hans Zimmer, that brings a dignified and majestic soundtrack. It isn't the best superhero movie, but it is a step in the right direction for Zack Snyder by telling Kal-El's story once again.",
        "This is honestly one of my favorite films, has all formulas of a great film. Truly recommended it to those who want to give DC a try...this is DC's highlight not like suicide squad, BvS, JL.",
        "I was so looking forward to seeing the new Superman installent \"Man Of Steel\". After viewing it last night i walked out of the theatre with an abundance of disappointment. The movie was an overdose of Sci-Fi special affects that i've seen on more than one occasion over the years. I never felt any love interest between Superman and Lois Lane. Amy Adams was most definitely a miscast. There was no humor throughout the film....far too serious for my liking. The Tornado in this film was so fake! But I will say that Henry Cavill is a fine actor and has much potential but i blame mostly the Director for this really bad film. I loved all of the previous Superman Movies. This is only one that i was not able to truly enjoy. Two Thumbs Down....Way Down!",
        "Zack Snyder is known for directing visually appealing films. This movie is a spectacle that utilizes CGI almost perfectly. The opening scene alone is enough for me to call this movie good. The fight sequences are intense and exciting, making this a thrilling watch.\n\nThe story is different from usual Superman shenanigans and dives deeper in the character of Kal-El, allowing the audience to relate to him much more by demonstrating the human side of Clark Kent more than the kryptonian side. The cast is all top notch, with Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner as stand-outs. The drama is extremely well-realized, there are a couple of really sad moments.\n\nAs far as the negatives go, Snyder's use of zooms overwhelms and the 3rd act is way too long. Otherwise, it's a must watch for superhero fanatics.",
        "This movie was absolutely amazing ! the cgi is better than most movies in 2021 ! the story was amazing and was a great origin story. The fight scenes and cinematography are out of this world and this film also has the best score i have ever heard. PLEASE WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE",
        "All the haters will hate, but this is the best movie ever made",
        "The film is just fantastic. It presents the origin story of Superman in a great way without being boring and we see the entire trajectory of the boy Clark Kent until the Super-Hero Man! The film also shows the responsibilities that he has to assume due to his great powers and the consequences of his battles, being these epics on grand scales. Zack Snyder still proves to us unintentionally, that it is possible to adapt a Dragon Ball movie with mastery! A beautiful start to the DC universe in theaters!!!",
        "Earlier, Batman Begins (2005) movie was my favorite movie. But, When I watched this movie after that this was my favorite movie till now. Story, Action and casting of this movie were amazing. In a live action superhero movie, fight scene in air is best till now. This type of action scene I have seen in an animated movie Shazam: The Return of Black Adam.\n\nDirection of this movies was very good. After watching this movie, I have become fan of Zack Snyder film making. Although I watch Zack Snyder's directed earlier movies like 300, Legend of Guardians, Watchmen but I found this movie is the best movie directed by him.\n\nIn role of Superman/Clark Kent, Henry Cavil is amazing till now. Christopher Reeve was best in his own era but in this period Henry Cavil is the best.",
        "This movie is a perfect kickstart for DCEU and a perfect combo of all the direction, the score, storytelling, visuals everything is outstanding.\n\nDon't listen to anyone just watch the movie and you'll end up having a good relief.",
        "I really love this version of Superman. Henry Cavill has portrayed the character very beautifully. when we talk about superhero genre we always look for action sequences and vfx to be good and this movie has done it great,the visual effects are stunning, alien invasion looks so unreal as if it has happened for real and Action sequences it is just mind blowing. I can say that it is ahead of time for which some people had problem with the tone but honestly the dark tone fits well with the present real world kinda situation and that's why it's makes more interesting. Overall its an epic movie and it is highly recommended.",
        "This is at least an 8 when you look at the other rubbish DC have released. You can tell that Christopher Nolan has had a big part in it (see Batman Trilogy). Excellent story, excellent score and excellent action. Its not ground breaking, but it's the best DC film post Dark Knight trilogy by some way, and continues to be to this date. I loved the Kevin Costner great parenting message it sends out. Superman is a good character, not a vigilante like The Batman, so I'm not sure what people were expecting?? What it does do is makes the original Superman films (including the awful Superman Returns) look as bad as his sh#t outfit he wore. Well, well worth a watch.",
        "This movie is the best rendition of superman I have ever seen. Is tells the best back story and gives a whole new light and breath of fresh air to the franchise ever. And the visiual effects are stunning and so real it is like it could happen today. And if part one is like this I can't wait for part two but as I said this movie is the best movie ever made with one of the top villains ever even almost as good as Ban form \" The Dark Knight \" . It started out a lilttle bit slow but it gained momentum quickly. Even though the parts of the movie where his fortress of solitude is a space ship instead of an ice palace was a bit of a let down but other than that I give this movie 10 out 10 stars. Because everything is amazing the special effects the acting the villains just awesome.",
        "I am a big superman fan and luckily got a chance to see its early screening and believe me it was a brilliant movie. I had very high expectations from the movie and this film has completely exceeded my expectation. The visual effects and action sequences in the movie are actually the best I have ever seen. It easily overcomes The Avengers in every single way and will for sure emerge as a big blockbuster film at the box office. I don't know why the critics are saying that it focused more on the action than on clark kent's character. It was completely balanced in all ways. Its a must watch movie for every one and in my opinion its not only the best movie of this summer but also the best comic book movie of all time. And yes with a better score also put in by Hans Zimmer. 10/10",
        "Great work of bringing the character to our time. It is the day 1 of Superman, please understand that. Great sound track, amazing visuals. Give it a chance. It is different. It is the Superman Movie we need it to understand the this character has to evolve.",
        "'Man of Steel' is an emotional and beautiful journey about responsibility, rejection and finding your place in the world, that brings the Superman mythos perfectly in our modern, realistic world. For sure one, if not the best Superhero - Origin movie!",
        "Big characters and a larger than life story for a larger than life hero. Character moments are relatable and profound. Watch it once a year and probably will never stop doing that.",
        "Don't believe the hate reviews. This movie is different from the usual Superman movies. It is one if its kind. And Henry cavil is best superman that we have seen till today. He just fits in to the superman suit like his own skin. The story narration is good. An enjoyable journey of superman. Expected more Superman sequels with Henry as lead. Sit back and enjoy. Really deserves a watch before getting judgemental on this movie.",
        "It is best movies ever made by DC. Absolutely a master piece by Zack Snyder. Perfect story, visuals, soundtrack. I truly in love with Superman after watching this movie. I watched this movie over ten times and still watching in 2021. It is truly under Rated movie, its rating should have been over 8 atleast. I must say Michael Shannon acting is beyond imagination in this movies equally played with Superman. I have no more words. JUST MINDBLOWING.",
        "The man of steel took a new take and enjoyed it.it was one of the best superhero films for me .it didn't felt like a mcu clich\u00e9 movie.it was certainly an original superhero movie",
        "Most underrated movie of the decade. Zack Snyder evidently is one of the best directors ever. Henry Cavill's acting is overwhelmingly excellent. The best actor for the role no one could perform as superman better than him. This is arguably the best Superman movie till date and unique. Unlike most marvel movies man of steel is one of the most realistic movies ever. The cgi is mesmerizing with gorgeous visuals and realistic fight executions. Intense, action packed movie with excellent storyline. Fck the critics the movie is truly the most underrated movie of the decade. Masterpiece movie",
        "A remake of the Superman origin story.\n\nGreat casting of Henry Cavill, Michael Shannon and Russell Crowe. Great cameo from Kevin Costner too. Really not convinced about Amy Adams as Lois Lane.\n\nThis is a film in two parts. The origin story is great, the escape from Krypton, being raised as a human and covertly using his super powers. However, the whole space ships and General Zod pieces were not good, pointless fighting between invincibles.\n\nOverall, great cast, really good special effects, excellent origin story but otherwise a terrible plot. Disappointing. Stick to what you do best i.e. Saving humans from disasters.",
        "Such an incredible accomplishment for producer Chris Nolan and director Zack Snyder. \"Man of Steel\" sets out to approach audiences as the first of the franchise and it certainly does just that. Powerful and memorable performances along with stunning jaw dropping visual effects, this philosophical adventure will not leave Superman fans and new comers disappointed. Henry Caville, along with his brilliant ensemble cast, truly make you believe a man can fly. See in theatres immediately!!! The action will leave you breathless in your seat. Hanz Zimmer delivers a score you hum in your head time and time again after leaving the theatre. I am a huge fan of Superman and and thrilled this film was made.",
        "Absolutely brilliant as a stand-alone film. One of the most underrated superhero movies. Arguably better than a lot of the marvel films.",
        "Precisely everything I wanted and expected it to be",
        "Zack Snyder and David S. Goyer kick off the DC universe in theaters, introducing the responsibility and grandeur that the greatest hero of all time has to deal with and carry.\n\nThe script presents the internal conflicts, the difficulties and why Kal-El really is the necessary envoy to protect the earth.\n\nThe film is hopeful and teaches about being good regardless of the situation and also carries the weight of consequences when it cannot be the symbol of peace.",
        "Honestly the best superman movie we've got The portrayal of superman is so realistic is so emotional",
        "This is the best version of Superman so far. Great plot and action scenes.",
        "Precisely everything I wanted and expected it to be",
        "The truth is one of the best superman movies that I have seen, good special effects, good script, good director, good cast of actors if there is something wrong with the movie, it would be at first a little bit I remarked only a little slow but then the film only increases its quality, I see that there are many people who put a star for silly reasons for example I found a guy who gave him 1 star because he did not like the director, the truth should give this film a chance since I assure you what are you going to like",
        "Man of steel is masterpiece of it's own kind. The movie is a visual treat and is just amazing. 1. The Script is the backbone of the movie and it is perfectly made. 2. Screenplay is magnificent. 3. Visual effects are just mind blowing. 4. The soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer is the beauty of the movie. 5. Well I couldn't find any flaw in the movie to complain about, everything seemed to be perfectly synced. TO be specific I would say that director had taken his effort to make it look better than previous superman movies and I should say he succeeded in it. The actor and actress in the movie gave their best and like all other superhero movies, the actress is given a role worth doing. The difference between the other superhero movies and this movie is the script and the way it is being narrated and showed.",
        "OK i just went to see this in 3d imax , hmm i liked that everyone else there was a superman fan \"no talking\"! .....the first 30 mins was good...er , but someone else classed it as a never ending advert, I agree. It just never really started for me, i was waiting & waiting.....then after an hour i was bored and did NOT care about the characters..sure Superman gets most of the screen time, but perry white? less than 2 minutes.....i just didn't care...it was like a high budget promo for a new superman series. I just didn't care what happened to the characters,i just had no reason too,this jumping back & forth to explain current events,it just didn't work...I felt nothing for Johnathan Kent, he was just too much of a minor role......probably in it less than 2mins once again....I greatly preferred the previous \"superman returns\", i cared about what happened, Lex Luthor seemed bit odd but i got used to him..it mattered.....Lois was sexy & hurt that he left...it mattered it had mystery........man of steel? not for me, just for kids or people who don't really understand depth of film.....if u like avengers (puke) u may like this.....tho avengers was worse,i cant think of anything worse than that......just Cuz it has a lot of action doesn't make it good......",
        "IT JUST UNDERRATED . Don't believe me watch it for your self all of it people hate on it just because there bored .",
        "This was a decent entry in the never-ending series of Superman movies, as it attempts to reboot a never-ending movie series. It starts off well, with the story everyone knows of Krypton exploding and the infant being jettisoned off into space. It varies the theme in Clark's childhood and adolescence as he tries to \"fit in\" with his powers while his adoptive earth father tries to help him. He finally learns how to harness everything as everything \"comes together\" with Lois Lane, etc, in adulthood.\n\nThis movie relies a little too much on chase scenes and special effects, but it's not too bad. I loved the scenes in the classroom and the interrogation room. It might satisfy you if you are a Superman fan.\n\n** 1/2 out of ****",
        "The key to great Superman stories is to have ones that give Superman a deep and complex problem that speaks to society at large. Man of Steel successfully reinvented him for the 21st century.",
        "Despite the fact that movie contains some melodramatic scenes which could be a little shorter its still the best action sci-fi. Especially i like episodes with Faora-Ul and i don't like that she dies in one of them. Women should always win. It's evolutionary must and they are evolutionary direction. Other thing related to superman as a character is the fact that he teams up with thugs from Justice League and of all kinds of street scum. It's not his level. In the next movie i hope there will be no batman and other fairy tale characters, Faora-Ul resurrects, kicks superman ass and open business in Manhattan",
        "Zack Snyder,David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan's Man of Steel,adaption of Superman by Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster is innovative and pretty inventive with their new theory and visuals but it is still not up the mark as i expected from these guys,Especially from Nolan i expected as good as The Dark Knight. The hype couldn't let me resist from watching it. I have watched all the superman movies till this day and read a few comic books too. I would definitely say that 1978 version has better story than this. The character development and script is okay. Henry Cavill makes a great Superman but not expected Clark Kent. The one thing that stole the show is action,Special effects,splendid visuals and Digital animation all in 3D. It was a pretty good experience to watch the modified Krypton and superman powers in Perfect effects and 3D. Now waiting for the sequel ,hoping it would get better. Otherwise it was good movie.",
        "So many negative reviews! Some Movies we dont understand so this means its Bad? NO! If u Judge something then you should know the Basics and honest with your ratings. Its Epic Movie powerful score beautiful cinematography and Brilliantly Directed. Hats off to you Zack Snyder.",
        "Since his debut in the late '30s, Superman has been one of the icons of comic book geeks. His eternal fight against evil got immortalized in the 1978 movie starring Christopher Reeve. And so, they brought him back in 2013's \"Man of Steel\".\n\nUnfortunately, this outing goes too much for CGI and high action. Superhero movies are supposed to emphasize the hero's cleverness and the villain's plot. The last half hour of this movie is more like a Rambo movie. On top of it, the movie has too much of a religious bend: Superman is less a character that inspires cosplay than a Jesus-like figure.\n\nSo, I don't recommend the movie. Amy Adams had a better outing later in 2013 with \"American Hustle\".",
        "The best solo superhero movie i ever watched. Casting, story telling, action fights everything was lit",
        "Although the film is slightly too long, it is still an epic and emotional tale of Superman realising his destiny, telling a familiar yet different story to the previous films. The music and special effects are fantastic, but the characters and style make it feel very familiar to recent blockbusters.",
        "A very deep, compelling, and believable storyline. DC emotionally touching you is a rare treasure.",
        "Henry Cavill does a good job this flawed, yet mostly well made take on Superman that could have been much worse had Zach Snyder not held back on many of his trademark snyderisms, and remains the best pre-Wonder Woman DCEU film",
        "I cannot understand how this movie is so low-rated. Story, soundtrack, CGI. Best superman movie in our time. I am in no way criticizing the old superman movies. Loved them too.",
        "The first half.is decent, although the scenes and dialogue are hammy. Surprisingly, Kevin Costner provides the best and most authentic acting. It's a shame this movie didn't have better creative people and producers; the wealth of acting talent is wasted.\n\nThe second half of the movie is an incoherent mess of disjointed plot and nonstop screaming and explosions. There's only some many times I need to see glass shatter and buildings crumble-I get the point. Apparently, this constitutes entertainment. I wasn't the least bit engaged intellectually or emotionally. A waste of two hours.",
        "The Best CBM of all time. The origin story, The music, the direction, the cinematography, its an piece of art. This movie has so much heart. & Henry Cavill is the best Superman ever.",
        "Man of Steel is one of the best superhero origin movies out there.",
        "Best Adaptation of this character. I think Snyder and the entire team working on this gem did a amazing job !\n\nI litteraly love that movie. Just fantastic !",
        "First off, this is the best Superman movie that they have made in, literally, decades. It set a great tone, murky and dark in all the right places, while also offering a good sense of comedy, at least in the first half. While it could easily be argued that the movie's run time was far too long, it still used what time it took wisely in both back story and character development. That is to say, when it's not blowing up everything in sight along the way. The action sequences were very well put together, though some of them could have used some toning down. Overall, it brought a new light of hope for the Superman franchise that Superman Returns missed, and could help rebuild the damage that Lester did back in the 70's with his cinematic atrocities. The characters were very well kept with their roles (with Fishburne making a surprising appearance) and I cannot wait for a sequel to show itself in the next three years. Definitely a proud addition to the DC film collection.",
        "This movie will be a gem with the time.hamz zimmer background scores have nailed it.Visuall story telling was so good in this",
        "Just my opinion and taste, this movie is the next level of origin super hero movies. Zack snider have a keen eye for realism and extreme details. Does not matter how many times I watch it i still falling love with the characters. This movie has the best actors.",
        "Man of steel is a masterpiece. From the cinematography and effects it is by far one of the most impressive superhero movies I have seen, and finally a serious movie of the greatest superhero, Superman.\n\nWhat I love most about man of steel is how serious the tone is. It's a story of a man raised in a different culture, his struggles trying to fit in, to be one of them and to finally recognise who he really is. In my opinion, it's a beautiful story. With some fast paced action that needs to be seen, some scenes I wasn't able completely take in from the first watch. Man of steel definitely needs more than just one viewing. I highly recommend owning it on blue ray.",
        "I'd give Man of Steel an even lower rating, but I found the acting to be marginally credible (I thought Kevin Costner did a particularly good job and Russell Crowe wasn't bad either). There's not a whole lot of depth to any of the goings-on tho. MOS steals from a bunch of other movies. The early counsel scene is taken directly from the 2nd/3rd Matrix movie. MOS / Henry Cavill stole scenes directly from Wolverine's X-Files formative persona. The fight scenes especially at the end stole directly from the 3rd Matrix movie (I really thought Neo and Smith were going to fly by for cameos). The City sequences reminded me of Independence Day. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) reminded me of Kate Mara in House of Cards (but with more clothes on). I know the plot's driven by the comic book, but can't we do better in the rationale department? Folks on Krypton just got stupid one afternoon? Hey, speaking of the Matrix, I see MOS borrowed the Matrix's general for essentially the same role. Don't forget to bring a pair of good earplugs to this loud-fest of predictable CGI-dominated caped extravaganzas.",
        "It was a perfect introduction and entrance to the DCEU. I love Superman and this movie was a legit Superman movie as it should be.",
        "Zack Snyder directed, as an example, Watchmen, a film I really liked. Christopher Nolan wrote/directed stuff like The Dark Knight, Inception and Memento.....all films very high up in my personal rankings. I could now go on with - Russell Crowe, an actor I really like......OK, I think you see where this review is leading to....that film was an disappointment. With this representation of these Krypton alien folks it looked like Christopher Nolan wanted to give Zack Snyder the possibility to re-live the success of 300' and Russel Crowe the possibility to show himself again as the heroic Gladiator. Well, both fail. All that is paired with a mediocre and pale super-hero in nylons. I'm not able to point something out what I did not saw much better before in another movie already. Everything, from costumes to camera over to the score from Hans Zimmer, everything felt like \"c'mmon, let's make quickly a block buster\". Big names all over, big budget, big super-hero story....what in heavens name can go wrong ? Yes, indeed : everything ! Superman deserves better.",
        "This Superman is set in the real world. This movie is so underrated and disliked by some, because he is not Superman. This is not a film or story about Superman, but how he became Superman and what it\u00b4s like to be different.",
        "This movie didn't bother to provide a reason for the non-comic book crowd to care about the characters. If you subtract or otherwise disregard the previous superman movies, then all you're left with is some weird tale about a willfully reclusive guy who's chosen to save the world and has a devotion to a woman (Lois) whom he only shares screen time with for a few minutes.\n\nThere's no character development in this film. There's very little humanity in it. It gives you few reasons to keep watching, but if you have nothing better to do, it's not a complete waste of time. It's on par with the countless other half-baked movies that possessed a fraction of this movie's budget.",
        "I was never a superman fan and this movie made me fall in love with the character. Most realistic take on a superhero.",
        "Okay just got out of the cinema after 2 hours 23 minutes of more or less the same old thing. No great surprises. I got the feeling that I seen it all before, mainly because I have! It could of done with being shorter and action was a bit messy and very repetitive. When will directors also realise that using a shaky hand held camera is really annoying especially when the film is being projected onto the big screen. A couple of millimeters shake of the camera appear more like a 7.5 on the Richter scale when on transferred to the big screen. with the amount of money they spent on the budget surely they could have afforded to a have rented a steadicam. Obviously another film that doesn't live up to the hype. Has Hollywood run out of ideas? I want something totally new not a rejigging of a previous version. I left the cinema feeling that I had wasted both 2hours23 minutes and \u00a36 on watching an old rerun.",
        "This movie is a good superhero movie, in the same time it has a great science fiction part. It goes fast everytime. Flashback sequences are awesome. There are some points which is not make sense like Zod's breathing on Earth. Also, even though movie's fast tempo is a great thing, in second part it goes so so fast and you cant figure out whats going on clearly and thats not cool. But I can say, Man of Steel is a great beginning for DCEU and Henry Cavill fits Superman role excellently.",
        "This is the Superman for my generation. Visually stunning. Best scores out of any other superhero movie. Great action sequences. This is the movie which Made me a Superman fan!",
        "This is one of the best superman movie I have watched till now action scenes were epic and the tone of the movie was little dark but I don't mind it very much. But you should give this movie a check. And Zack Snyder know what he is doing and he have done a wonderful job. Hats Off to him. Damn Good.",
        "This movie is the perfect example of how superheroes like superman will fight....Some marvel kid made marvel a ideal,there is nothing dark about this movie...THIS IS THE PERFECT SUPERHEROES MOVIE for me so far(2020)",
        "When Superman takes on the three Kryptonians in Superman II, I could keep track of the action comfortably. In MOS, the CGI is so chaotic it is difficult to know where to look. It's a shame, because this film has some great moments. Costner and Crowe as the twin fathers are perfect, Adams emails her usual reliable performance, while Cavill puts his own spin on Superman. No one will ever replace Reeve, but this iteration is pretty damn good 7/10.",
        "When I first watched this movie at the theater, I was somewhat disappointed. Mostly because it was so dark and gloomy, far from what I'm used to for a Superman movie. Ever since I met Henry Cavill in person, I have a greater appreciation for the movie. Not only that, but the more I watch it, the better it gets, and I realize what a great movie it actually is. Zod was a great villain. I even liked Faora. And of course, I like Henry even more now (as an actor of the movie and as a person). At least unlike other actors, he actually really cares for the character, it's history, and its fans. Makes me appreciate the movie even more. And at first I didn't like Zack Snyder either, but after watching MoS, BvS, and JL, I admire him more.",
        "I didn't have high expectations going in to this movie, especially after the appalling mess that was The Dark Knight Rises. However I would go beyond \"pleasantly surprised\" and say it left me with a buzz. Cavill really looked the part, the pacing of the movie worked well for me, and I thought it was the first movie that captured what it would be like for someone like Kal El growing up so different on another world.\n\nIt is also the first time Superman has been.. well.. SUPER. Every other movie has portrayed him as pretty much a human with powers. Man of Steel was a movie about a guy so much beyond human that we can not even compare.\n\nPerfect movie? No. Great Superman movie? Heck Yes!",
        "It was one of those movies where you just don't want it to end. It is a little scary for the little ones but it is one of the greatest movies of all time. I just want to warn you if had had a heart attack or something like that then i would say don't go. It is 100 percent scary from the point it starts to when it ends. It is defiantly good in IMAX 3D or Real D 3D. It i just a grate movie that you got to see your self. If you have seen another superman movie then you are in to a big surprise it is absolutely outstanding. You will just want to stand up and cheer when it is over it is the bomb. I just know hat you and your whole family will enjoy it. I just know that it is going to be the best movie you will have ever seen i hope you enjoy this one of a kind masterpiece of a movie. i just hope that you enjoy it as much as i did you want be let down it is a winner for sure go get your tickets now.",
        "Wow. Talk about destruction. First off, let me say that anybody who has doubted this film because of it's \"lack of humanity\" is DEAD WRONG. I'm not saying that I speak for everyone, but there were several parts of this movie (no spoilers, don't worry) where I was more than a bit choked up, and wow, let's talk about the action sequences please. WOW. The sheer destruction and CGI is better than the Avengers, maybe even better than Iron Man 3 (and of course I'm only comparing the two in terms of visual effects). If I had any complaints about this movie, it would be about the pacing of the plot. It seems to go very fast, never really taking a moment to breathe. However, this is all done to cover a huge amount of material in a finite amount of film so it is forgivable. Man of Steel: 11 out of 10 stars for being not only the best Superman movie yet, but for possibly being THE definitive superhero movie.",
        "I thought Man of Steel was a great movie, from beginning to end. The acting was first-rate, especially the actor who portrayed General Zod--he stole some scenes from Russell Crowe playing Superman's real Dad, and that's not easy to do. But all the actors did real well and the military was well represented and believable. I had to chuckle a little when Superman reveals he has been on earth \"33 years\" and the image of Christ is behind him in the scene from the church. But that's cool. Director Zach Snyder does a great job with this movie and the special effects, spaceships, and fight scenes are incredible. I am glad I bought this movie in Blu-ray.",
        "Entertaining , great visuals , and action, the film takes the same story of the original superman films but improves visually on the 1978 classic although this actioner doesnt have the charm of the original and cavill is not quite christopher reeve ,this superman is much darker than reeves version, basically this flick is a remake of superman 1&2 in one movie , its good three quarters of the running time but the ending does let this movie down, 7/10 , it flys but it doesnt quite soar but on the plus side this entry is slightly better than the following sequels batman vs superman : dawn of justice (2016) and justice league (2017) .",
        "My girlfriend and I were very fortunate to win passes to the world premiere of Man of Steel in New York City, including hotel and airfare. The movie is incredible from beginning to end - decent plot, amazing cast, top notch cinematography, and high quality special effects. This reboot from Zack Snyder has brought the Superman franchise up to the level of quality we have only seen from the Dark Knight films. Henry Cavill with the new look suit has comfortably carried on the modern-day legend that began with the beloved and missed Christopher Reeves. I will be watching this movie a second time - with my son - and I am looking forward to it! Well done Warner Brothers!",
        "Stunning action moments, great casting choices, great story telling and surprisingly this movie allows lots of colleteral damage. What makes it actually more realistic .",
        "as far as superhero movies go,this one is fairly decent.but it doesn't compare to most of the Marvel cinematic universe.as a movie in the DC cinematic universe it's not too shabby.it's got good pacing,the action and fight scenes are well choreographed.the story is okay.it is another origin story to a point.but it doesn't get bogged down in that aspect of the film.the acting is good here all around Amy Adams shines(in my opinion)as Lois Lane,Laurence Fishburne makes a good Perry White.Michael Shannon is convincing as General Zod.Russel Crowe Plays Jor-El and Kebvin Costner and Diane Lane play Clark|Kent's adoptive parents.Henry Cavill plays Clark Kent/Kal-El,and he brings some gravitas to the role.while putting his own stamp on the character.for me,this film is better than the previous installment,Superman Returns.for me,Man of Steel is a 7/10.",
        "I saw Man of Steel five years ago on Father's Day and I really enjoyed it. Henry Cavill is perfect as the latest Superman/Clark Kent of this decade and liked how his iconic suit - without the red briefs - is given a new makeover. The other actors like Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane and of course, Michael Shannon are great in their roles respectively. The DC Universe is getting better with each movie based on our favorite superheros. Man of Steel is sublime and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is awesome.",
        "At no moment in this movie is there a sincere moment between these characters. The origin story jumps all over the place for no apparent reason. Why the shaky camera? Those shots don't bring you into the movie when they have no meaning. Horrible time placement. Lois figures out Clark is Superman in the first hour? This is too bad for words. But, Michael Shannon is great. Zack Snyder started out his career very well. I love the Dawn of the Dead. 300 and Watchmen also were good and have replay value. Then along came Sucker Punch. I thought, \"this is a terrible movie but you can't win them all\". Man of Steel proves he is not as talented as I once believed. Ben Afflec as Batman... I know a lot of people that enjoy this movie. I wish I could. If you thought the Transformer movies were \"amazing\", this movie is right up your alley. Avid movie goers that take content over action stay away form this piece of sh*t.",
        "Well, I gave \"Man of Steel\" every benefit of the doubt. Even when the trailers were lackluster and the soundtrack unremarkable, I still went to go see it hoping that it would reawaken my love of all things Superman...sadly, it did not. While not terrible it certainly was far from remarkable. Guess the best thing I can say about the film was that it stayed well within the boundaries of mediocrity for at every opportunity this movie takes the low road. The story, the acting (lord the acting- can Henry Cavill have less of an emotional range?), everything about this movie felt as if I was watching a rough draft instead of a finished product. Nothing about this film screams Superman as much as it says \"Hey! We found a muscular guy that somewhat looks like Superman! That should be enough for you...right, RIGHT??\"",
        "The rating on this movie makes no sense because it's a very well done film with a great story.... And stars Henry Cavill... what more do you want? I loved the original Superman with Chris Reeves but I certainly appreciate this one as well...",
        "Im happy that they called this movie man of steel because it does NOT deserve the title of Superman. That prestige belongs to the Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh Superman movies. Firstly ,superman is nothing without the John Williams theme. This is the one time in movie history where the music should never be changed. The music in the new film is the worst I've heard. It has no substance, does not make me feel excited at all. Henry Cavill is a fine actor, I find no faults in him. The flying is crap. Each time he takes off its like a bullet and cgi...it looks fake. I want to see him fly on wires like Reeve. The storyline had heart, I admit but executed poorly The action in the movie is OK but weak cgi is no excuse. I cant believe that I hate my favourite superhero ......",
        "This is truly the best Superman movie I have ever seen. It was doubtful at first because of the previous Superman Returns movie in 2006 starring Brandon Routh as Superman. That was horrible and had me think that this was either going to be worse or something much better.\n\nThis turned out to be an awesome movie that surpassed any and all of my expectations. I enjoyed the balance the movie had of Clark Kent becoming Superman. It was well played and written. Henry Cavill plays the role of Superman extremely well (but no offense, Christopher Reeves is the greatest Superman of all time).\n\nThe special effects of this movie were unreal. The fighting that happened between Superman and General Zod was some of the best action sequences that I have seen in a movie between a super hero and a villain.",
        "We all love the Christopher Reeve classics, but they never actually went deep in to the character of 'Superman', in those movies, Superman was presented as perfect and flawless, while this masterpiece presents a Superman that makes mistakes and is really trying to find himself in this world, this movie made me relate to Superman since he was made more human than any adaptation of Superman, the casting is great, the plot is great, the CGI is great, the writing is very good! This movie is very underrated. It's the perfect Superman movie and really helps you relate to Superman, this Superman tries to find himself in this world while not knowing his true purpose, when the first flight scene happens, he finds his goal, he realizes what he needs to do, to be a HOPE to the humans.",
        "Worst movie. The opening had promise with Russell Crowe as Jor-El sending his son on his journey. The minimal dialogue revealed very little about the characters. Even Lois Lane is a shadow of her former self, with longing looks and not much of the spunk we expect from her character. Where is the fun news room banter? The entire project is based on computer graphics explosions and destruction. They destroy building after building after building, gas station, supermarket, skyscraper, until you are just bored with the repetitive plot. It is terrible. The fighting is a blur and Superman is just not his super self. Don't waste your money unless you are a young male looking for a movie that looks like a video game. I am so disappointed that they made an awful Superman movie. If you like anything besides violent fights and explosions, you'll be bored to tears. Save your money for the next Spiderman, Bat Man or Iron Man movie.",
        "I wanted to love this film. I thought it would be especially great in Imax 3d. Unfortunately, and sadly \"Man of Steel\" is very short on Superman's story and instead substitutes fights, special effects and loud noise. It is really no more than a badly made live-action cartoon that wasted potential and opted to be just another action and little more than that film. It is difficult to comment on the acting in this film because it required so very little other than perhaps knowing how to look good in front of a green screen. Even the 3D was far from impressive.I should have watched my Smallville DVDs again instead of wasting my money on this film.",
        "One of the best & my favourite movie till date... Amazing cast and what a movie.",
        "It was a great superhero movie. i don't believe in judging superhero movies. They are always entertaining . To comment on this movie i like the efforts that were put in this movie. The content of this movie was beautiful from the beginning to the end THE 3D EFFECTS WERE awesome. Mr Nolan has redefine the superhero movies. Just like batman begins. They show how the journey of superman began,his early life, his emotions. This movie was perfect but there were some plot holes but still overall It wasn't disappointment as many people have to complain. it was a great experience watching it again on my TV. Amy Adams, Henry did a well job. I am looking Forward for a sequel!",
        "Snyder is good, for sure. But all his movies have a sameness about them. Long, drawn out fight scenes, with lots of things smashing and blowing up, tonnes of CGI. While this is what the audience wants, other superhero movies like Batman and Spider-man have more dialogue and character development, to balance out the huge fight scenes. Superman, Avengers and Justice League movies are all so over the top it gets a bit tedious. Story > effects. That's why the original Star Wars is still such a classic.",
        "I originally watched this in the cinema and came away massively disappointed. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that I hated it. Expectations created a different movie in my head with John Williams music playing the Superman theme in moments of glory... I didn't get this. Move forward a couple of months and it's released on DVD, do I decided to give it another chance. I was more impressed but still not the euphoria I'd come to know from watching my favourite super hero. After all, this is Superman. Fast forward to 2019 and this is one of my favourite movies, up there with The Avengers movies and Chris Nolan's Batman. The more I watched it the more I saw how utterly brilliant it is, seeing new and different things during each watch. The story has been put together fantastically and the opening scene is probably my favourite in movie history. Cavill is an amazing Superman and first the part brilliantly. And of course Kevin Costner plays the part of his dad, and Costner is awesome in every role.",
        "The first instalment in the DC Extended Universe is far from the perfect re-envisioning of Superman mythology and is severely bogged down by its muddled script, bloated action & weak characterisation. But thanks to Zack Snyder's innate eye for spectacle & visual grandeur, there is a magnetic quality to it that churns out instantly memorable cinematic moments whenever it does get the combinations right. Man of Steel may not be the best all-round film in DCEU canon but despite the glaring shortcomings, its highs remain somewhat higher than what other entries in the franchise have given us so far.",
        "That was the best movie ever!!! I can't believe it was the first installment of DCEU (DC Extended Universe) !!!!",
        "ALERT (Bad English Ahead) I don't understand what the hell is wrong with critics,why so hatred. every scene is perfectly placed..you might not understand it in first watch but after watching it 2-3 times i realize it that they are indeed have meaning and are true to the story. This is the movie which actually help me to understand superman character, i am not a comic book reader but after watching this movie i have become superman fan. superb action + superb story + perfect blend of drama + excellent coverage of each character + excellent soundtrack = Best Superhero movie so far. i recommend everyone to watch it.. and i hope..they will(must) deliver good in its sequel BvS:Dawn of Justice",
        "Ritualistic, stylistic and not much more. Full of Smash, bash, beat 'em up and destruction, it will surely please all the immature little kids out there...but it doesn't do much for the moderately intelligent. Stan Lee did his infamous bit performance here, so he probably approved the outing. Or is it perhaps that he is becoming desperate. No matter, he is becoming a liability rather than the anchor he once was in the Fantasy genre.\n\nMan of Steel is chock full of action, but very empty in the areas of back story and character building. In this film no character is sacred, especially Superman himself. Relying solely upon visuals, there isn't any real story line to grab onto. We are treated to more astounding technological wizardry that isn't explained certainly, and scene after scene of monumental fighting and destruction, but only one or two scenes total showing the Superman soul...as I said in the Summary, just another remake that falls short.",
        "Loved the movie, the final battle was amazing and DCEU is heading towards the right direction.",
        "I'm still not sure how to feel about this. And it's not about the story and I'm not (was not) a big fan growing up. So I'm not comparing this to anything else than the previous movies that existed rather than the comic books. That it's way better than Superman returns is something that could be expected. Especially because Chris Nolan was involved as producer, though that also meant the fun/camp feeling of Superman went out the window (without the flying abilities of our Superhero at hand here).\n\nThe (main) problem I had watching this, was the action scenes. It did feel like I was watching someone play \"Mortal Kombat\" or Street Fighter. Going through walls, jumping like digital Yoda on drugs, that kind of thing. The story is pretty straight forward though something we are not used to seeing in Superman movies. Will have to watch it again I guess",
        "I don't know if there's ever been a film about Superman's history, his planet and his family.That's what I liked most about this movie.\n\nit just bothered some times I had so much war scene I didn't expect to have so much action,could have been less than his was good. Superman is very well chosen I like a superman,at the same time as the body of this man Superman liked you say.",
        "We are talking about THE MOST powerful being on earth here. The alienation, the sheer power of the being, the public image, the sense of justice, fraternity, it's all covered in here. A very important side of Superman. We always needed a more mature take on the man of steel, and we got it with the help of Zack Snyder. Thank you very much, this actually got me interested in the man of steel.",
        "It is strange how an alien life-form that has absolutely no knowledge of the existence of a planet called Earth speaks in contemporary English to facilitate the comprehension of a worldwide audience. 'Man of Steel' bored me to death. It was tough to keep my eyes open as special effects took over the second-half of the movie with repetitive action sequences featuring innumerable fight scenes and collapsing of buildings in a manner that reminded me of none other than 'Michael Bay.' I smiled when the movie came to an end and my mind began to recover from the clamor. Difficult to fathom that 'Christopher Nolan' is associated with this venture. 'Kevin Costner' brought some genuine moments of earthiness to the affair. 'Amy Adams' was good as always, and 'Henry Cavill' shows potential of becoming a credible Superman. Having said that, we still miss 'Christopher Reeve.'",
        "I'm sorry to all Super Man fans but this film is a totally crap! My definition is TOTALLY BORING!!! If you like explosions and destruction of everything, then this is the right film for you! Otherwise... stay away from the theaters please, you will be disappointed. The plot is a crappy boring one, i think fast and furious 6 has more story line than this. Acting? No need for that in this one! In one word i will tell the film that took two and a half hours of my life: BORING!\n\nWait for it come out in DVD and see it at some friends house! BTW , there's a lack of imagination as well!\n\nPeace",
        "i will not carry on about the negatives as others mentioned already, but really original superman SO much better, superman returns is better than this. this film has so many mistakes and stupidity , anyone seen any of the superman movies will say the same, in fact all of the people i know who seen superman says the same so i m just wondering how come this silly movie get over 7 on IMDb? especially the last 30 minutes is so boorng with all the we know who wins so called fighting scenes, its like ps3 game. il give 3 out of 10 if it wasn't anything to do with superman i would have give 4 or 4,5 but this is nothing close to what we expected.",

        "I will never understand why this movie was so badly received by some. I feel like the second people see Snyder directs anything, it's instantly written off. The score, the acting, story and visuals were all great. I wish Warner Brothers wouldn't have mishandled Superman after this movie...there was so much potential before rushing to being Batman in after this movie.",
        "I should have known . How could I be so stupid to watch a movie from the same director who gave us crap such as \"300\" . And he did it again. The best parts ? : when superman does not fight. OK , I like some action, but when it becomes so ludicrous ridiculous as in this movie I give up. It makes 2012 even look nice. Tension build up : zero ! Acting : not so bad , but do not expect any feelings for the characters. Action : over the top stupid.Story : what one can expect . Hooks : none . Cinematografic : that's why I gave it one star. Let's face it : Hollywood is only interested in money. To those directors who gave us Transformers,Battleship Los Angeles, Prometheus,Man of Steel,2012,After Earth etc : please stop pounding our eyes and ears with crap. To be avoided unless your brain is already empty.",
        "That it abruptly starts without bothering with a credits sequence enhances the feeling that you've wandered in in the middle of something; while the gravitas invested in banalities spouted by the cast like \"What are you going to do when you're not saving the world?\" makes me wish the makers of these films would lighten up and come to terms with the fact that they're making popular entertainment, not Greek tragedy (or as the title of this instalment suggests, Wagnarian opera).\n\nThere's a lot of unsubtle product placement, and Aimee Adams is wasted as Lois Lane. But Antje Traue makes a formidable, saturnine henchbabe as Faora-Ul; whose sneering observation that \"The fact you possess a sense of morality - and we do not - gives us evolutionary advantage\" to an American audience obviously marks her out as a wrong 'un.",
        "No way this movie should get anywhere pass a 7 and that's being nice.\n\nIf you never knew the meaning of \"Lot's of action with no action\" This movie would be the perfect example.\n\nMeaningless action, just throwing each other to one side of the camera and then to the other side.\n\nNo story line. Superman is colder than ice. There is no real action with meaning. No humor, Just plain old no frills Superman.\n\nDo your self a favor and save your money, Or better yet rent yourself a Christopher Reeves Superman part 1 and 2, you will enjoy that much more.",
        "I must say that Superman Returns (2006) was a far better film than this.Henry Cavill is the most boring Superman, yet with zero facial expressions.The movie wastes much of its time in establishing the characters.It examines the viewer's patience as Superman takes lot of time to come on screen.Cavill looks tired on screen, Amy Adam looks aged,Like she has been mistakenly cast.Zack Snyder's direction is functional,One would expect more from him after Watchmen(2009) and 300 (2007).Sorry Mr.Snyder but this time not justified.The problem of the film lies in its screenplay,which is confusing.Rather than entertaining,It tries to spoon-feed every detail about the story.All in all Man of Steel is not what you are expecting.My RATING--*1/2 out of 5",
        "Man of Steel.The blockbuster of the year.I agree. THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEST SUPERMAN FILM. Nolan's touch,and Snyder direction complement yourselfs. Henry is the best superman and Amy Adams is a great Lois Lane with red hairs(a good idea). You can't forget the gladiator and Costner too. You can see all the time the ideas of Goyer and Nolan in the film. i have been expected a long time for this film and great expectations are all most bad,but this movie corresponded with all my expectations. THIS IS EPIC. And the expectations of the Justice League film are on the best place possible,in our mind.Don't try to compare Batman and SUPERMAN,just enjoy the movie.",
        "It deserves to be the iconic Superman movie for a whole new generation.",
        "A mediocre movie overall, starts out great becoming slower and almost painful to watch later on. The original had a far better story and was perfectly bought out. This remake lost most of the original plot and does not have a strong watch ability factor, actors with big names too couldn't pull up this disappointment. They tried to combine the original three parts into one, making a mess of the entire story. FX was great as expected and the background to the disaster on Krypton which was missing in the original is well told, enjoyable but for the first 20 mins. Afterwards the movie goes into a never ending series of flashbacks to Kal el's life as he arrived on earth, even here they have not stuck to the original movie. IMO, the original was much better, even without the FX. If you like CGI effects this is the movie for you, but for a Marvel fan this movie is like a scrambled egg without taste.",
        "You can come up with all the theories you wan, but this is a bad movie. It is bad and that's it. There is no connection n the story. You have 3 parts, the beginning - his parents etc. a a little of him in his teens and a exaggerated fighting scenes finale. You don't have nothing to hold on to, you have nothing to keep you wondering... it is simply empty. All the actors seem not to fit in their characters, special the \"evil\" ones...Nevertheless i think the main actor was good on his role. It is not an horrible movie, but it is far far away from being a decent movie.. If you take the Superman passion aside you''l sure see it the same way as i see it..",
        "As a kid growing up in the early 80's I always looked back at 'Superman' as I do 'Star-wars', a classic film/movie but sadly I don't feel this way of 'Man of steel'. Firstly they've lost the highly glorious Superman tune which was so important as it had and always will a big impact on this comic book hero. Then as fashion dictates there's the need for over doing the computer effects etc, which makes you feel like you're watching a kids play-station game. Also I might add the late great Christopher Reeve was always going to be hard to replace as Superman and unfortunately Henry Cavill doesn't steal his boots. Sorry but I really wanted to leave the cinema with a spring in my step and leave a nice review but I left more interested in thinking how good the old Superman movies were. 4/10",
        "I have seen this film on its first day of showing in our region and I must say it has all the right ingredients you want in a movie. The movie definitely has a heart. It touches every aspect of our sensibilities. It has also the awesome effects expected from an other- worldly powers. It has the action needed in conjunction with a superhuman protagonist and antagonists. Each characters, in a way were introduced fairly. The execution of the sequence were superb. This is where director Zack Snyder is good at. He uses the tapered style of sub plotting and not the ordinary. Overall, this film has everything you want in a movie. Must see.",
        "If you're a hardcore Superman fan like I am, I highly recommend for you to see this. The casting, cinematography, visual effects, directing, score, and story is amazing. Personally, this movie is the Holy Grail to all of film. If you love Superman, check out this film.",
        "If I were to rate this movie based on the first half, I would have given the film a 9. I have been following the Superman fantasy since I was a kid in the late 1950s. The were scenes in the first half that were very fresh. Sorry, no spoilers. But once the action scenes with the aliens began on earth, they were relentless and repetitive and in some scenes, dumb. I actually couldn't wait for them to end.",
        "Man of steel is the movie with so many supermen. i dnt like the idea of many supermen from some strange plant.\n\nthe real superman is the Natural born man or Alien and others are just some kind of Artificial. But all the outer plant species are equally strong, so kind a strange. Then also it is a good movie with a nice story-line. better than previous one... hold a good grip through out the movie, a viewer never gets bored and the sequences are good. A more detailed story about the life of super-man,which is good at-least for not boring at all. Except the many superman kind of things over-all the movie is good worth to watch. New superman is also good,Have a good body,acting can be compromised besides a superhero movie can be made only with good shape and looks(lol). But the bottom line is this \"Movie is worth time spending\"",
        "This is the movie I waited years to see. It's better each time I watch. The care in filming and only using CGI when needed shows. The flight sequences are incedible. Great cast all the way around. Nolan's hand as producer is evident and filming style is beautifully done.",
        "I just got done watching the pre screening an hour ago and wow. The actors worked well in this film,non stop action from start to finish and its OK for \"The Man of Steel\" to be serious. I was reading previous reviews on this and everyone was saying he was way to serious. I am here to tell you yes he is but think about wouldn't you be serious to trying to figure out who you are if from a different world. Not to kill it for you but the cgi scenes were also fantastic. It was just enough cgi to make you understand that this world is not real and this is what could possible happen if fights or destruction would occur in the real world. All in all great movie I'm not giving it a number cause then I'm using a number system to be picky. It's not good it's great, for adults and children. You can admire the will and inspiration of this film and don't just go off my judgment on all of it. Go see the film yourself and try to imagine if fantasy became real, don't go in thinking,\"this is impossible.\" Wow is the greatest answer I can give.",
        "I was really looking forward to this movie. I thought it would be intelligent and ground breaking, showing Superman from a realistic point of view. The whole movie was stupid except from the first 15-20 minutes which was very nice.\n\nWhy stupid? I'm sad to say that it felt like Christian propaganda, seriously. So I'm totally confused in how the movie gets the high rating. Are only Americans voting or what? If you are a critical thinker, a skeptic and/or a non-believer this movie will make you feel violated buy ignorance. I mean \"evolution always win\" is one of BAD GUYS lines in a scene while fighting S-man. Come on!? Make me a bit nauseous.\n\nIf you like intelligent movies, don't support this one.",
        "I think man of steel really telling good Superman origin story And DCU best movie",
        "BEASTLY action. AMAZING music by the GOAT Hans. i didn't like some parts of the story. overall very entertaining movie with a lot of epic-ness (4 viewings)",
        "As a big superman fan, boy was i happy to see him come back to the big screen i mean i over anticipated this movie and what came was a shock to me. Not only were the muted colours and dull characterizations sad, this movie drags on for what feels like forever before an explosive finale which feels more like a transformers movie than a superman movie. There are not many ways to make a movie about superman interesting i must admit but it does not mean you have to make him a sad guy who an audience cannot even be bothered to root for. Take away the vampires from twilight and replace them with superman and u get this movie. After watching this you question who needs to be saved, superman's girl or the audience",
        "I've always disliked Superman because he seems too overpowered, but this movie not only made me enjoy him, it actually made him relatable. I was sincerely impressed with Cavill, Crowe, and Shannon's performances. The action was stunning, specifically in its ability to show how little and weak humans are in comparison to these aliens.",
        "All there is to say is what a disappointment. I even shelled out the extra bucks for the IMAX experience. That was a huge waste. Thin plot, ridiculously long fight scenes, way too much cg and terrible ending. I used to love superman and DC comics growing up. DC movies can't hold a stick to Marvel. The characters are too one dimensional. It's all eye candy and no substance. Two thumbs down!! I can't believe that they would even consider making a Justice League movie after this hunk of garbage. I usually rate movies as to whether they are worthy of seeing in the theater, video purchase or cheap bootleg. This, I would not even waste $5 bucks to see.",
        "Worst Superman movie ever made! Ugh it was just terrible! There are no words to describe how crap the movie was! It was the worst in the franchise! How can people waste their money on something that could be thrown into a shredder! It was crap because it was just a terrible movie.\n\nKal-El, son of Jor-El and Lara is sent to Earth after his home planet Krypton leads to a complete incineration. Now taking the name \"Clark Kent\", he then discovers his true persona when he is guided to become Superman: A hero committed to protect Earth's fate and the harm that threatens it. However, General Zod, a citizen of Krypton and its military leader looks at Earth's fate differently and decides to use it with a sacrifice for all humans. Superman, with the help of present military and news reporter Lois Lane makes an alliance together to stop Zod from obliterating human existence.",
        "I thought this movie was decent the first time I watched it. But now, after several viewings, I think it's great and highly underrated.",
        "This movie has pacing issues but explores the Superman character pretty well. He doesn't really feel like Superman much in this movie, Cavill has the looks but not the script.",
        "A star for effort. Snyder really wanted a new version of Superman; the problem is Superman doesn't want to be new. If Batman represents cynicism, Superman should represent idealism.",
        "Review on Man Of Steel: I've been waiting for months to see this film and it has finally arrived. From the beginning when I read that Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer was the team hired to remake superman, I was excited. I loved Snyder's adaption of Watchmen (2009) and of course admired Nolan's trilogy for The Dark Knight. So I knew that this movie was going to be epic and IT WAS! Despite what these idiotic critics say this film was incredible. They gave life to this realistic superman. They showed more of the man and what it meant for him to grow into his human side. Though the beginning of the film did move at a fast paced, it was all worth the rush with what the action sequences brought and they were mind blowing, powerful fights. Kevin Costner and Michael Shannon gave great performances worth watching. Amy Adams version of Lois Lane was at its best and as for Henry Cavill, he is this generations superman and should be right there next to Christopher Reeve. This movie to me is the movie of the year hands down. A must see film. RJ's Rating: 3 & 1/2 Stars",
        "I went to watch this movie being aware of the hype and having some expectations of my own taking into account that it was in the hands of Nolan and Snyder. That being said, Superman is not my favorite superhero but its one that deserves a worthy movie, which I've been expecting for a long time now. And I must say it blew my mind.Everything you might want out of a Superman movie,its right there. It's action packed,it's fast paced, and the introduction in Krypton was already worth my money. I thought that being the first Superman movie again and having to go through the introduction again would make it slow but they handled it amazingly well. The cast is extremely well chosen,and Cavill makes a perfect Superman. I also loved how we get to see a villain that is,well, evil, instead of some poor misunderstood guy that takes it out on everyone. We get a villain that truly believes in his cause and doesn't care about the rest.Superman finally gets the movie it deserves, im just so glad that it happened and im gonna watch it again really soon.",
        "Overall the movie was pretty good. Im not gonna go into a lot of detail but I will tell you the one thing that stopped this movie from being great.\n\nSPOILERS The thing I hated about this movie and a lot of movies recently is the superhero(Superman in this case)is losing almost every single battle they get into. I also saw this in Iron Man 3. Anyway Superman lost pretty much every single fight he got into. He didn't do much fighting until later in the movie but once General Zod and his mineons got to earth Superman lost every battle he was in until the final one against Zod where he just barely pulled through at the very end of the fight. Cals dad said that he grew stronger than he would have because of the earths sun, so if he grew so strong than why could Zod and his minneons so easily beat him up? Also in Iron man 3 in the end of the movie the bad guys were beaten only because the regular citizen helped defeat the bad guys.",
        "10 out of 10. Best Superman movie ever. Can't wait to see the sequel. Have been waiting for many years now. What else to say. Only one unrealistic moment in the movie. 1 nobody is wearing seatbelts on the alien space ships.",
        "After the dour and boring Superman Returns, many began to wonder if the most famous comic book icon of all could be made relevant for modern audiences. In short, the answer is \"Yes\". Zack Snyder's Man of Steel may not be win many points for subtlety, but its blend of epic action, iconic imagery and deep character exploration help to move Superman into the 21st century to stand along side the similarly re-invented Batman of Christopher Nolan's trilogy.\n\nLike 2009's Star Trek, Man of Steel will likely draw its heaviest criticism from long time fans. But, also like Star Trek, Man of Steel will appeal to the masses and help revive interest in this iconic character.",
        "Being a big fan of Zack Snyder's work after 300, I am delighted to see the way of respect for embodying a legendary comic book, is very much intact as he is giving us The Man of Steel who seems to be made of flesh and blood. And with the British Henry Cavill's beautiful Super soul that bares witness to a delicate heart behind a Super cavalier way of conducting himself, leaves me greatly satisfied to how epically Superman's jacket has been handed over from my childhood's Superman, the late Christopher Reeve, onto the stoutish shoulders of Henry Cavill.",
        "This Man of Steel is a real shame. Awful script, awful image, awful music, worse superhero costum ever seen in a movie. It just should be called Man of...steal, because not only it has stolen most of the script of the Richard Donner's version of Superman, but also steals from the heroic fantasy wave that has seduced most people this last few years (Game of Throne for example) in the first part of the movie, as you will see that the costum and look of it seems to come from the middle-age. What's more, is in this first part, the strange birds on which the characters are flying, that also seem to come from Avatar. And it's only the beginning. The other part of the movie takes place on earth, and the writers (shame on them) have just done a horrible job, scrambling the chronology of the story, with flashbacks and flashforwards, totally useless and pretentious. This is one of the most messed superhero movie I have ever seen : it even has almost no humour at all. Very serious, as Henry Cavill himself who spends his time frowning you don't know why ? Maybe seeing the result of all this waste, he feels like going to the men's room ?0)",
        "After the Superman Returns movie I wasn't really sure that this would be better. But I was really wrong! This movie is an amazing adaptation of the Superman story! I was really impressed and happy with it. I watch it often and still find new details to love. The CG effects are done really well, and the story is great. I know that most people don't expect much from a comic-based movie, but even my parents really enjoyed it. I really hope that the next chapter will be as good or better, because like the Avengers/Marvel franchise I want a LOT of new movies in this DC Universe. I give it 10 stars because I was impressed and I am a huge Superman fan.",
        "Yes, Man of Steel is flat out awful. Think worst of the Mummy films meets 300 awful. This pathetic Warner Brothers money grab is pure garbage. Honestly, when CGI stupidity isn't clogging up the screen for the last half of the film, it's boring, poorly paced, with predictable \"twists\" well done enough for the taste of an average eight year old but mature intellects will be crying foul. A big budget wash over Superman Returns without the charm or fun of what we want out of our summer popcorn films. Look past its technical CG precision and you'll get one unusually dumb film. It's a true waste of a great cast.\n\nI blame Goyer for the terrible script and Zach Snyder for not being smart enough to polish that bad script enough to deliver anything fun or meaningful. This movie falls into the abyss of most summer movies - excellent advertising for an inferior product. Just think, some people thought they were disappointed by Ryan Reynold's Green Lantern. Man of Steel adds to the bad WB resume. Time for an Injustice League movie now where all the crap floats to the top of the bowl?",
        "If you're under ten years old this one's a must see: You haven't seen all that many big, menacing alien spaceships. And your fill of overly-amplified sub-woofer blasts every time an action 'event' occurs has not yet been reached to banality. So many special effects (that everyone else has seen before). You're not much into plot or character development--there isn't any here....whoopee! Lessons learned?--oops, the good vs evil axiom of prior Superman stories is either absent or undecipherable in this installment, so no need to fret over \"missing the big picture\".\n\nAdvise: MISS this big picture.",
        "I had high expectations going into this and so wanted to love it. I was so disappointed in the overall plot and left feeling that there was way to much time spent on the demise of Krypton, how the boy got to earth etc. For almost the first 1/2 hour it was all about putting the baby in a pod and sending him off. The other disappointing factor for me was the sci-fi aspect. Way. Too. Much. With. The. Spaceships. If that is something you really like then I think you would enjoy the many, many battle sequences but for myself, I just wanted to see Superman grow up and become the hero he is. It was too much a cross between Star Wars and Star Trek. So I'm giving it a 4. If they do another, hopefully we can move on from Battle Star Galactica! :)",
        "Zack Snyder's Man of Steel to me was absolutely what we deserve of the hero. If Superman was to exist in the real world, this is how I'd imagine it to be. How the world would react. The story, the visual, and the action choreography (The action sequences were 1 of the best for a superhero movie I've seen). I remember when some fans would complain that Superman was a boring character because not anyone can take him on, so the director had him take on General Zod & kneel before him. Henry Cavill is my favorite Superman to date, he nailed it, he played the role perfectly. There were some things about the movie that I felt will cause controversy among fans but I didn't mind it, I thought within context of the story, it all made sense. My favorite Superman movie.",
        "This movie is really good, It's a shame that It's so badly reviewed.\n\nI just love it, Henry Cavill is Superman!",
        "The best thing I can say about \"The Man of Steel\" is that it is, well\u0085 deeply imaginable. But is that always a good thing? Is this what the director of \"300\" dove the waters of his spirit deep to find, a darkening and almost inaccessible alienation of the Superman dynamic, until it is almost unrecognizable as the \"Man of Steel?\" These are iconic characters submerged into the depths of a graphic novelist's imagination, where beauty is transformed to ugliness, where divinity is transformed to the demonic, where a heavenly vision is turned hellish, in the name of a realism that exists only in this gifted filmmaker's mind. Yes, he is extremely talented, but at what cost to the moviegoer, who sits in na\u00efve desperation at his dark, alien vision, reaching into the gloomy gray of it to grope for some earthbound substance, to find a character named Clark Kent, and another one named Superman. Somewhere in this gray, clouded vision of ashes, they are lost.",
        "This wasn't a bad movie - it had a lot of good scenes from which the studio made an awesome trailer. Indeed, I was hoping from the trailer that this would be the best Superman movie of all time, but I have to rate it 4th, after the two Donner films (Superman, and Superman II) and the sadly underrated but wonderfully moving \"Superman Returns\", a film that had tremendous heart and soul, great character development, a little humor and plenty of CGI action to show off Supes' power and humanity, without the overblown audio, shaky camera, quick zoom and refocus, lens flare, extreme-close-ups, twirling camera cuts and other tricks that made MOS' action scenes dizzying (in a bad way), hard to follow and left me with a headache. And I have to say, this movie was really hurt by the omission of the wonderfully iconic John Williams Superman theme. Instead, we got plenty of product placement ads. I'm sure the studio will be pleased with the money it will make, but this film failed to deliver an emotional punch and in the end, wasn't very \"super\".",
        "This is why i didn't even bother paying to see this stupid movie, I got a free ticket. all the movies today, even superhero movies, have sunk so low. they are all about stripping the heroes of everything that makes them good and generally awesome, and making them \"gritty\" and \"dark\". cmon, that's just stupid. cant BELIEVE they had the nerve to bring back a character that only Terence stamp is worthy to play. there wasn't even KNEEEEEEEEL BEFORE ZOD! it was just pathetic. i didn't like the new Batman's for the same reason i cannot enjoy this movie. they are all too serious, too lame, and no heart. I only went cuz a friend of mine wanted to see it, but judging from Nolan's name being attached to it, I knew all too well what to expect. I will never let a friend make me watch a movie i do not want to watch ever again after this! i will stick with the Chris reeve movies and the 50's superman TV show with George reeve if i need my superman fix. those are the TRUE representations of the character, and yes i even liked Superman Returns, which was a fitting end to the saga that Reeve started. \"man of steel\" wont be getting any praise from me.",
        "Yes, it's another reboot/origin story for Superman and a bit too gritty at times for a Superman movie but it is definitely better than Superman Returns and quite an impressive spectacle. Also Henry Cavill makes a perfect Superman.",
        "What is it with some producers these days? There are those who seem to suffer from a no shut off valve ailment. Trust me, long doesn't necessarily equate to better. Take this movie as a good example. Had about an hour of never-ending battles been cut from this film, it would have been\u0085well\u0085super. As it was, it seemed like just another villain who will not, can not, die epic. The casting is perfect. Every single character was portrayed by the right actor and actress. No quarrel with that part. But the battles and fights that seemed a constant assault on the senses were over-load. I attended this movie with a friend who is a true to the bone Superman fan, has never, nor would ever, miss a single movie about Superman...and even she came away from this one unhappy. Bottom line, too much, too long, too aggressive. Too bad.",
        "6 only for making Superman's characterization, bringing back to how it supposed to be... Henry Cavill did the finest justice to the character, and Amy Adams was the opposite (worst), do not count me wrong, could it be the way her character made...\n\nThe movie promises to be breathtaking when we watch first 15 minutes of the beginning, puts our hopes high.. But there we go, too much unnecessary violence, meaningless script... I am a huge fan of Zack and Christopher.. But sorry ya, You got me hate you this time, disappointed!! Do we really need 143 minutes to spare for the movie with epic emotions and brutal violence? Ah, that was too hard to bare!!\n\nBTW, better avoid watching this movie in 3D, and do not think of IMAX at all. 2D is okay to go, of course If you want to watch... We can even ignore watching this movie...",
        "Not Like overrated Marvel Junk..gret stroy telling,great visuals and epic war scens!!!",
        "Henry Cavill plays an awesome role as superman in this film and all the other D.C movies that he played the same role as, they definitely should be making another man of steel movie with him in it, they are definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.",
        "And it's been turned off after 10 minutes. Feel so sorry for any intelligent person that went to watch this expecting a good film - although I guess most intelligent people, like me, didn't fall for it in the first place. I don't really think any of the Superman films have been good, but this one is just along the same-old lines we've seen recently a thousand times. It's all about action and explosions, and nothing to do with plot or character development.\n\nAt least I laughed at Superman IV. This is trying to look serious. That's the real joke haha. When people stop going to the cinema falling for this tripe, the movie makers will start to put effort into a film, instead of laughing at the sheep. Baaaaaa!",
        "Man of Steel is simply the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight..the story is spot on, the cast is strong, its written well..\n\nthe action is just epic it simply beats the avengers last fight scene and superman does it alone..\n\nHenry Cavill could use a bit more humor but thats fine..the CGI is best iv seen so far..they don't drag it anywhere, the pace is just right..Russell Crowe is fantastic and you don't feel any character loosely written like in most movies..and hanz zimmer just nails the music..it is just perfect\n\nlastly Zack Snyder has just made one of the best superhero movie and this is definitely worth a second watch..!!",
        "Im writing this review to save people a few pounds and to save you some time , so heres my advice\n\nGo to your local park find a dog turd wrap it in some red cloth and throw it from a high building.\n\nPretty much sums up man of steel.",
        "Why do Directors today feel we the public need 1 hour of loud continuous destruction scenes???? The movie started out great with interesting character building and story line. The last half was the same old been there done that green screen video game action. The director really missed a great opportunity to make a film with some real SUPERMAN story punch. Instead, he pandered to the easy green screen visual assault on the senses with sound so loud, the dialogue was lost. Had the ending action sequence been less over the top, I would definitely want to see this movie again. Knowing this, I doubt I will ever want to watch again. Get a new director.",
        "The story idea is good, typical of Goyer. Some of the scenes are good; the performances are pretty good, with Kevin Costner turning in a fantastic one. In fact, it's fair to say he is under-used. The film does also look and sound very fancy; Hans Zimmer once again brings the magic he is so well known for, but sadly the execution is overblown and all over the place; exactly the sort of approach I would expect, and was worried about, from Snyder. The man has very little grasp on how to actually tell a story, and after the first rather choppy hour of substance, he quickly loses himself in his own playground; he even brings it in too long. So all in all, it's not without its merits and is generally a decent blockbuster, but the good moments aside, this is ultimately disappointing; a lot of talent squandered.",
        "Absolutely loved Henry's performance in the movie. He has done a fantastic job playing superman. Seriously this movie deserves more recognition. It's truly a masterpiece.",
        "I never understood the hate around this movie... he is so GOOD, with great CGI and great acting, and beautiful cinematography the plot is cohesive and well done a movie that was hated for no reason.",
        "I think hes bes actor for superman he fits in i wached all supermans and i think henry did best job please bring more out guys cant wait new movie. If other actor take over i never wach superman again henry please act every super man movie.",
        "I went to watch this with high hopes. It had good actors, a good director, and a wonderful producer, the last thing I expected was a poorly scripted science fiction movie with Transformer like landscape shots.\n\nChristopher Nolan, known for great characters in his Batman movies seemed OK with the lack of character and dialog; especially SuperMan, who should have the most character.\n\nThe acting was fine, but a movie needs more than that. Its constant fights and destruction needed some sort of comic relief, of which there was none, making it no more than a Michael Bay version of SuperMan.",
        "I loved it! More sci-fi than superhero, and some terrible acting but the plot is fun and there are some great fight scenes.",
        "This movie is awesomeeeeee! This movie make me a fan of Superman. Brilliant story,stunning CGI,all the stories well connected , It is almost perfect to me. Love the scene that his father's sacrifice,touching! The Fighting scene alike Dragon Ball Style and it is really stunning! Never thought that Superman Movie can be that great! Ever! Not like Transformer,Superman really have soul in him! Thats all credit to the director and all the crew! Thanks god they didn't make it like Transformer Pop Corn Style Movie. WELL DONE! I must say that I Love this movie as much as The Dark Knight.They are more humanity,not just CGI. Conclusion: ART + MASTERPIECE + HUMANITY",
        "Just watched Man of Steel for the first time in a long time. It's better than I remember! I was so disappointed when this came out. It's too earnest, too dark. But there were several strong performances from Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, Laurence Fishburne. And Henry Cavill was good too. The Zod stuff was just too much, too over the top. They should have pitted him against Lex Luthor on Earth.\n\nI'll say this for it though: after watching Aquaman last weekend, it makes me appreciate Man of Steel which was clearly better.",
        "Has special effects that far surpass the Christopher Reeve classics, and contains solid performances by all the cast. It however, lacks the appeal and fun, of the original in addition to John Williams incomparable original score. In addition, the movie relies a little too much on CG.",
        "I really like the 'Superman' series especially the movie which came earlier to this version.\n\nBut I couldn't agree with all the other one star reviews of this movie and not that other reviews were great , those authors simply enjoy the cinematography and story and not that nostalgic or other universal emotions that a hero or its compatriot should emboss.\n\nI really hate the Amy Adams in this title as she is really not the character the superman should be paired with or it may be just me.But I just see her as an actress who performs small roles and entertains.I couldn't stand her till the end of the movie.\n\nOverall,it wasn't good and except the main character every other character was skeptical and boring.",
        "The movie rocked so hard badk in the day. I couldn't believe how well Zimmer had lived up to Williams with that superman theme. This movie is defination of underrated.",
        "I dunno. Maybe if you're a mega Superman fan you will obtain more enjoyment out of it, but for me I felt next to no emotion the whole film. The visuals are all very bland and grey and the story lacks any sort of interesting elements until the last about 15 minutes which actually somewhat picked up in entertainment but far too late. I can at least say that the actors are fantastic fits for their roles; just in an incredibly boring story. Also there was something stupid happening every other minute.",
        "Best comic film to this date in my opinion. Great action, soundtrack and acting!",
        "Man of Steel is probably one of the most underrated movies of this year, It truly takes you on a cinematic adventure that is second to none. Director Zach Snyder plunges you head first into a great summer block buster right from the get go, and does a great job of keeping you entertained and informed. I truly thought that the implementation of continual flash backs telling his back story made it easy to follow the story and never had you guessing to \"well why did this happen?\". The movies climax is superb and as nail biting as it should be. Henry Cavill nailed the superman role and I am excited to see him be the greatest superhero on earth... at least a couple more times.",
        "The writing of the Man Of Steel script and story line was horrible and this adaptation of the Superman story is totally different from the true origins of Clark Kent/Superman and his dynamic with Lois Lane. Don't expect to watch a Superman story that you're used to if you do see it. The script writers, DC Comics and the Movie studio should've really thought twice before picking this Superman story to tell. The only thing they really got right in this movie was the Superman costume, by taking away those silly red trunks Superman used to wear on the outside of his pants. The action sequences were good, but a little drawn out which made them become boring at time and the dialogue for a supposed kid friendly movie was a little mature at time and honestly cheesy.",
        "One of the most powerful comic heroes struggles between who he is and how to be a man. I know the colors are dimmed and the story dark. But it's the struggle that makes this storyline great. That we can relate to a character struggling in society. But in the end he finds himself to be more human, by taking someone's life to save civilization. I'm a hardcore Batman fan, and this is the only reason why I envy Superman, that Zack Snyder got to direct a Superman movie and bring it from comic books to life.",
        "Though the beginning is a bit slow and the middle sort of choppy it works well into the film for what lies ahead in the end of the movie. Henry Cavill was the perfect man to portay superman, he is now the default man of steel in my book. A lot of critics are bashing this movie because they are from ageneration where cgi was nonexistent. but i digress the film was great,tons of action and lots of back story and a very heartfelt plot. the score in Man of Steel easily gets an A+. the acting an A. the Story a B+. the villains an A+. and the main man himself gets an S for super. this is the superman movie that we've all been waiting for. I would be completely content with my life if i was never told another Superman origin story again. Im giving Man of Steel a 10/10 it is the perfect superman movie and also the perfect superhero movie.",
        "This is the movie, which gives you WOW feeling. I would say, it is undoubtedly best movies of the century. All the actors are great, Sound effects are excellent, well shot and Written. Direction is awesome. What a action!! It will keep you on the edge of your chair. When i saw it, it was like how it was made. It is shocking surprise!!. IMDb 's current rating is grossly underrated. It deserves more than 9. Near to perfect movie of its genre. If you are seeing this movie first time, it is difficult to blink an eye. The whole tempo of movie is maintained throughout.\n\nThis deserves 10/10.",
        "This movie just left me flat all the way through. It was like they got mesmerized with the special effects to the point where everything else was left behind. I don't understand why every movie done on comic book hero's feels they need to go back and explain their version of the origins. If we are there to watch the movie, we already know about the beginnings, likely with more detail than the director and screen writer. It took at least forty minutes before there was a chance of any new story line. Then there was a good twenty five minutes of special effects. That left an hour for a new story. That just isn't enough time.",
        "NO SPOILERS ----GO WATCH IT IF YOU LIKE ACTION MOVIES.\n\nI honestly did not expect much from this movie, so I was astonished to have liked it. The last Superman that came out in 2006 was, in my opinion, very bad and this one really delivered. The movie had great visual effects and had like non-stop action. The story wasn't amazing or mind blowing, but it kept me interested since i never expected to see so much destruction.\n\nIn other words, just go watch the movie, and watch it in 3d because the 3d makes it even better. This superman movie won't disappoint you since can see that the actors also tried to put themselves into it to make a better movie. The villain was great and i really hope to see them make a sequel.",
        "There's nothing to say, just watch it. Henry Cavill was made for this role. Now that DC is changing it's always good to remind ourselves of the real Superman.",
        "well the movie is based on a very good script and i have to admit that. the fine thing is I like more the father of superman than him. the real pain is his dress. NO, i am not saying about the design or color rather it is pretty good at todays technology. but the real pain was the durability of superman and his dress. Neither he nor his dress had any scratch after this epic battle! is it a joke??? the most funny matter is whenever it is a concern about earth why it had to be America and specially New York?? Satire after satire but i have to admit it had some serious promotion in the script, dress (whoever know the joke of supermen's dress, i don't think i have to explain it), graphics, sound and acting. though i found a lot of faults, i loved the movie as it made superman that is something different and more attractive....",
        "i really enjoyed this one. There were massive expectations on the film as there always will be with superman and i think they have really pulled it out of the bag. first of all the producer and director coupling of Nolan and Snyder was one that was made in heaven wasn't it? Nolan having the epic story telling and super hero experience from the bat man trilogy and Synder having the special effect and fight scene knowledge from 300 and further super hero experience from watchmen it was never going to fail. Although i was slightly surprised by what i would call a rather chaotic narrative which seemed to jump back and forth and if you were not concentrating it would lose you. Henry Cavill made superman everything i wanted it to be. And there were also praiseworthy performances from Amy Adams and as always the magnificent Russel Crowe.",
        "I loved this movie as a comic book geek. this is my disclaimer.\n\nI have heard friends say they didn't like this version because there wasn't enough of the love angle between superman and lois lane. they didn't like it because there was so much carnage. they didn't like it because the ending was so anti-climactic.\n\nacting may be hammy and the feelgood themes might be a bit 'in your face', but let's get real here: all the themes and incidents that they present in this movie is probably what would happen if the same scenarios happen in real life. so, minus the overdramatic hero shots, I'd buy into it. Besides, it's better than the invulnerable superman I've seen in my youth.",
        "Well i have seen all superman movies .... and let me tell you i was not expecting this from man of steel ...... i was expecting to be in category of super humans saving earth and beating the hell out of the villains ... but hats off you proved me all wrong .. the script was great ... all the actions felt real ..... the love felt real ..... and yes hats off to superman's fathers , both played a awesome role ..... lastly its a must watch movie of 2013 ...... The screenplay is very well planned . The movie becomes a little bit slow in between but it is required for the climax . All the actors played the role well ...... haven't seen much of henry's movies but seems promising , will remember him for this role when i go through his future films .. Happy i took the risk and paid off .... guys don't sit at home go have fun with man of steel ...",
        "Man of Steel is a bad film and the worst Superman movie since Superman IV, it's a movie about Superman that dedicates a majority of the runtime to Lois Lane and was only concerned about action, with one of the worst superhero love interests ever and a terrible story, it's hard to believe the story came from the mind behind The Dark Knight trilogy, Man of Steel is an bad reboot for a bad superhero that did absolutely nothing for Superman, Christopher Reeve is better than Henry Cavill in every way and this film is straight up unwatchable in the last hour.\n\nI'm gonna give Man of Steel a D+",
        "I thought this Superman movie had a good story behind it even though it left out the humor that Christopher Reeves films had. It begins on Krypton and we see how Kal came to be and what his parents did to get him to Earth. And we learn about bad guy General Zod, whom was sentenced to being frozen but turned out to be good for him since he survived the planet explosion. They track Kal to Earth where he is Clark Kent and in this story not a reporter but a drifter, trying to hide his abilities but has a need to save people. He befriends Lois Lane and meets Zod, then they battle it out on earth. I thought the special effects were good with throwing each other through things and bringing down planes.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: It was just an entertaining 2 hours plus movie. Worth checking out.",
        "Superman has always been the quintessential clean-cut superhero, the sincere saviour of the day. While that essence remains, he now gets a decidedly darker, introspective and brutal edge under the Nolan-Snyder aegis. While the dialogues might be devoid of the cheeky one-liners that pepper other superhero films we've seen of late, it blindsides everything with sheer enormity of scale.This is a Superman film for today's audience. A hugely impressive and entertaining story of arguably the most powerful character in the superhero pantheon and also one of the biggest pop culture icons, it's clear that the Man of Steel is here to stay. Note: You may not like this movie if superhero films aren't what you go for.",
        "After watching all MCU, decided to find the reboot DCU and this one came to me. The Superman is handsome and surprise Kurt and Kelvin both took up the fatter roles. The fighting scenes are okay, and like the scene that even Kelvin will die, he does not let others knows Superman has superpower. The most confusing is the choosing of Amy as I think she's a bit mature. Waiting to see Batman vs Superman.",
        "Deafening, chaotic, and boring beyond belief this ridiculous mess has cured me of ever attempting to watch a so-called blockbuster action movie again. Everything is terrible. I supposed the effects are OK if you can see them through the distracting 3D. I have no clue what the plot is supposed to be about or who anybody is. I thought that Superman's Krypton mom would be the unintentionally funniest performance but that turned out to be Diane Lane. I can only imagine how boring it must have been to make, God knows it's boring to watch. Ugh.\n\nPlus it cost $22.50.",
        "I haven't seen this movie yet, I want to, but was told by a friend the story is a reboot of Superman 2, with some exposition in the beginning that's an abridged version of the basic Superman story. My question is: Why? When Superman 2 was made, did the writer hack up some story from a previous Superman TV episode, or steal it from a comic book? No, I think he put together a fun story about Superman fighting 3 bad-guys (one was a semi-cute chick with sexy crooked teeth) dressed in patent leather jump- suits. Back then I don't think a writer could get away with hacking other movies or TV shows, you had to know how to write a story. It's not difficult to write a new Superman tale, so why re-use an old one? That sucks. And I don't care how awesome the battle scenes are and how much better it was then the original Superman 2, it's still a hacked up redo with nothing original going on. I'm sick of Hollywood ripping me off.",
        "Wow, that was so well done. I had high hopes from Zack Snyder, and he did not disappoint. Even better than 300 and Watchmen. Finally, a Superman movie worthy of Superman's place in comic lore. The movie looked very expensive. I felt emotional for all characters. The casting was fantastic. The story fantastic. The script was fantastic. The visuals and Kryptonian technology was cool and original. My favorite superhero movies were Avengers followed by Thor, but this is now one of my all time favorite movies of all genres. I can't wait to buy on bluray. Any criticism would be really picky on minor things. Not to be forgotten, Henry Cavill is a perfect S-man, my god, he is ripped, and I am not gay-lol! But he is not just a muscle man, is looks like superman!",
        "the start was very good, and I expected great things to come. Unfortunately, the film goes on in confusion, the characters undeveloped, and the cinematography just showing off. After one hour, it was already boring, and wishing to end soon. The 2006 movie was way better than this... commercial business (as anything Christopher Nolan put his hands on, since 'Insomnia'). And there is no fun in it, just two or three lines thrown at the start and at the end of the movie. From Zack Snyder I expected great vision, like in its masterpiece 'Watchmen' - but there is no epic tale, but only a justification for futile big smashes and grand destruction - thus resulting into an overrated self-indulgent pile of (s)crap(s). All in all, a great disappointment from Mr. Snyder, but understandable, since Mr. Nolan produced this. Big money, but no art. An easy forgettable flick.",
        "As someone who hasn't really invested much time in any DC film series with the exception of 'The Dark Knight' trilogy, I finally decided to delve into the DCEU.\n\nI am a fan of the darker and more series nature of the film and enjoyed the grittiness and portrayal of Superman in a modern day setting.\n\nI found at times that the film didn't know which line to tread between serious (Dark Knight) and some of the more light hearted quips usually found in the MCU.\n\nFor me the biggest issue with the film stems from its slightly rushed third act.\n\nGiven the wider conversations around the Snyderverse, I am intrigued to see more in this universe.",
        "Good acting. Good CGI. Good music. Very entertaining.",
        "Superman is basically my favorite superhero. When man of steel first premiered on the theaters i was very excited, and when my friends who have seen it keeps telling me how good it is, i got even more excited. So when i finally got to see i, i had high expectations for man of steel. What i don't like about this movie: first, it's way too long. Second, the plot is kind of boring. Third, the fights are boring. It's basically the same fight played over and over again. Fourth, the actors aren't convincing. Despite these things, i like the fact that the actors are extremely good looking. The superman is hot!And i love to see Christopher meloni in the movie. I love him! I don't hate it, i just think that it's not that good and it shouldve been better considering the budget and time it takes to make this movie. I prefer the original superman movies, including superman returns. Im not saying you shouldn't see it. it eventually comes down to the audience. I saw it with my family and everyone loved it. I'm basically the only one who doesn't. I give man of steel a 4 out of 10.",
        "I have given this a strong 7/10 as, although it ticked all the boxes in terms of action and casting, it could have done with a bit more of that old Christopher Reeves charisma and charm to complete the film - but I am guessing that will be in the next film as he becomes Clarke Kent at the end! I blame the director for wanting more action and not the lead character. Regardless, Henry Cavil is definitely the right man for the job. He not only looks like the former 1978 Superman star, but is a very good actor too! His American Ascent over his native British ascent is almost unnoticeable, while he certainly brought in a new, real dimension to the role. I would definitely put this at the top of my action/superhero films and hop that the lead character remains for many more sequels to come!",
        "The director focused too much on special effects and how to bring the fight scenes to life, so the movie lacks in story and plot. Mediocre acting performances. Unnecessarily long, I always prefer short movies because if I don't like it - the ''torture'' won't last as long. This is only the second time in all of my life that I spent most of the time at the cinema staring at the ceiling. My friends' opinions were mostly similar, pointing out the large number of fight scenes with special effects, almost no story at all, however, they did mark it as ''watchable''. Maybe it's just me, but if you're someone who likes to sort of bond with the characters and the movie itself, Man of Steel should definitely not be on your must watch list.",
        "Rather sad movie. The single plus is special effects and setting. Quite good mounting and computer graphics, but scenario totally ludicrous. There is no development of characters, generally there is should speaks what motives are pursued by characters? It is necessary only to guess",
        "People that don't like this movie are people that are still stuck in the past. There's no need to rehash Christopher Reeve's superman movies and retell the same boring origin superman story. Reeves's superman was great when it first came out. At that time the first movie was fantastic, the second one was amazing, then the 3rd one came out which was awful and then quest peace was atrocious and Superman got dull. WB released Superman Returns which was just a rehashed version of Reeves's Superman which was okay but nothing special. Now here comes Zach Snyder Superman and he reinvented the character and made him amazing. He knocked it out of the ballpark IMO. The Flight scene in MoS was the arrival of a new era of superman. Zach Snyder made me love superman again.",
        "Enjoyed first 1/2 hour, good story line going. Then it went into 2 hour fight scene. Bored. I will never watch again.",
        "Man of Steel had great acting, story, and action. Cavil is Superman, he played the role perfectly. Shannon was fantastic and sinister as Zod. Adams was a great, spunky Lois. Antje was a chilling Faora. Crowe was a inspiring Jor-EL. Diane and Costner were such loving parents. Fishburne was great as Perry. This film was just great from the beginning on Krypton to the ending in Metropolis. The action was top notch, a great and epic final fight between Superman and Zod. All around this movie was fantastic. It doesn't at all feel too dark. This movie is really full of hope. I think general audiences and comic book movie fans of any will really like this film. Snyder has out done himself with this masterpiece!! I give this film a 9.5/10 just a great film.",
        "I was very disappointed with this film. It is a good example of everything right with modern film making, and everything wrong with modern Hollywood. The special effects are top notch (although the cape effect still looked fake), fight scenes are fun, but that is all there is to the film. There are so many scenes that are so contrived, it ruins suspension of disbelief. I was pulled out of the movie so many times, it was a chore to just sit through it to the end.\n\nI do not recommend seeing this film; if you want superhero action/adventure, you are much better off renting any of the recent Marvel films (Avengers, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, etc.) and enjoying on the small screen. Better a good film on a small screen than a terrible one on the big screen.",
        "I will watch almost any SciFi, Fantasy, or Action movie. It is a genre I like. In the past Superman has always been a sore spot for me as I am not crazy about the presentation. It seemed very kitsch, and too goody two shoes. This is the Superman movie that I have been waiting for me. It combines kitsch with grittiness to make an awesome movie.\n\nFor the most part the movie stays true to the Superman image, but does so in a modern context with a human touch. It will move you emotionally even though it is just a Comicbook action movie. The script writing was great, but what was as incredible is the casting. The movie casted the right people for the right role. It gave the impression of authenticity, again for a Comic book Action movie that is impressive.\n\nAwesome is the way I would describe this movie...",
        "Did you ever make a chili. It is wonderful. Did you ever decide you need to add something to it. Maybe to make it better. Than you added something else. And then you added more. Pretty soon your wonderful Chili wasn't chili any more. What was it. I don't know but it wasn't chili. And it was actually not as good as the simple chili. It took longer to cook. It had everything you could think of. It should have been the best dang chili there was. What went wrong. Too Much! This movie is long. It has a lot of action. It has a lot of Scifi. It has a lot of drama. It has a very complex story. Have you ever seen Christopher Reeves Superman. Simple. Funny, Drama, Scifi, Action, And a story. And it was good. Everyone liked it.",
        "This was a fine but not spectacular Superman film, boosted by having Amy Adams involved.",
        "Zack Snyder has lost all of his genius quality known from the awesome Watchmen! Man of Steel has no heart, only flat characters without soul, a stupid and chaotic storyline, the camera is also a mess. I was so disappointed that i think i will never watch any Zack Snyder film in my life.\n\nOver 2hours of dullness, bad actions scenes and no story at all.\n\nI remember only one scene with heart and soul. This scene was a flashback and showed the problems Kal El had in his childhood controlling his powers . Everything else in this dull, long stupid ride was a shame.\n\nI really hoped that Zack Snyder would do his best like he did with the Watchmen. But i lost my faithin him and his visions.",
        "two hours of almost sheer boredom. Seriously after the first half i could not stop yawning. even if you care for excellent cgi, it s not enough since the director (of idiotic movies such as sucker punch and 300)managed to make the action sequences so fast that makes your brain ache. There is no sympathy for any character, despite the promising first 15' of the movie (where the character of Clark Kent is being sketched - kinda), not to mention absurd physics and fighting scenes which could have ended a lot easier. It left me with a sense of incompletion .(i give it 5/10 cause there is potential there - maybe with another director).",
        "I didn't like the film. Honestly, I found it boring and tried my super best to enjoy the film but somehow I couldn't. I just don't know why? Maybe it was the Superman or may be it was just lack of sleep from last night. Animation was great in the film, but I really found the film too slowly paced for a super hero flick.\n\nSome people are comparing it with Avengers, well, I think its not even close to the greatness of Avengers, and I don't think I am gonna watch the sequel for this one.... If they make it, which they probably will.... Because I hear the film is already a box office money making juggernaut...\n\nFinal verdict... Huge expectations which turned out to be pretty mediocre for me..... I give 5/10 for just animation, because I didn't like anything else about this film...(P.s... I fell asleep 3 times in the theatre watching it)",
        "Man of Steel is a great return for Superman. Great in many aspects and particularly in the beginning half where the back-story is explained.\n\nActing here is good in some parts, bad in others. Everyone except Lois Lane was fine considering this is an interpretation of superman, not a translation. What I thought was unbelievable is Lois Lane and Superman falling for each other. A crush is plausible but Superman is here, there and everywhere. So how can a crush turn into love when he's hardly around Lois to develop anything? Story is also quite good except, again, Lois Lane appearing and going to places she'd never get near. The emotional content around what happens to Krypton is very, very good.\n\nA superhero movie that focuses on emotion, story, spectacle, and enjoyment is what I wanted out of this. It delivers.",
        "Whenever Marvel and Paramount comes with something, DC comics and WB comes with something greater than that.. Man of Steel is an example for this. This Movie is an epic for me in terms of emotions and VFX. Henry Cavil fits so well as Superman. It's so great to see Russel Crove in this film. Hans Zimmer's spine chilling score to this film is so so terrific. Michael Shannon as General Zod makes audience pee out of fear. Shannon is terrific in Zod. Final fight between Superman and Zod is mind blowing. Chris Nolan's and David Goyer's treatment of superman is so different and amazing. No matter what critics say, I liked the film. I will go with 10/10.......",
        "I was bored. I was bored. I was bored.\n\nI thought it would be cool as it was from Christopher Nolan. But it was just boring. I thought maybe it was boring because it had lots of substance. It wasn't to me.\n\nJust boring. I hate Superman and his movies.\n\nWhatever\n\n5 stars",
        "A film that wanted to be many things. A character study, a sci-fi classic, an action movie and perhaps even more.\n\nBy definition, Superman is an action hero and part of a fantasy franchise. In this latest instalment, the more part of 143 minutes is spent on the hero's existential struggles and identity frustrations with the action arriving too little, too late.\n\nSo, the effects were nothing sort of amazing and the action pounding. But what is the use if the viewer spends 90 minutes wondering what is happening and where this is going. Whilst it is noble and even advisable to show a superhero with weakness, the way it is done, it was essentially overdone. Audiences go to watch an action movie not an existential drama & also think the scene with the hero sitting in front of a glass portraying Jesus is plain laughable.\n\nOverall, this ambitious project makes for a dull experience, exceedingly unexciting.",
        "I won't be giving spoilers to this turgid film, so fear not. This time around we are privy to a remake of Superman II. If that is a spoiler, then I'll be damned. What we get is a full on effects feast for the eyes - one of the few highlights of the film. The other being Russell Crowe. He is excellent here and is in top form. Russell apparently is the only one in this film that can act - and act well. For a while this movie had me thinking it was directed by George Lucas. Aside from Crowe, all of the other well known actors here sound like they are fresh out of acting school. Kevin Costner gives what could be the worst performance of his long illustrious career. Laurence Fishburne the same. The rest of the cast is so uninspiring, you simply don't care about them or anything that happens to them. This film lacks genuine emotion and a reason to care. One word: Avoid.",
        "This movie is awful. I couldn't even bear watching it till the end. All the flashbacks are annoying and just make the story seem uneven and poorly developed. SO INCREDIBLY BORING. The guy who wrote the script , they should fire him. It's as if they assumed we already know everything, so why not just throw in some lame flashback type scenes everywhere we can for no reason.\n\nThe dude flying also made me laugh. I love Superman, but this movie is laughable, ow did it get so many positive votes?\n\nLois Lane looks old and not too believable.\n\nRussell Crow's part seems like such a waste of his amazing talent.",
        "This is the sixth Superman movie. It is a reboot. All the Superman movies are great and this is the best one. All the actors who played Superman are good. And Henry Cavil is best Superman. This movie has a lot of action. Superman vs super villain General Z.o.d. This movie has a great story. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. All the Superman movies are most see. Terence Stamp is great as General Z.o.d. But Michael Shannon is better. All the actresses who play Lois Lane are great. But Amy Adams is the best Lois Lane. Marlon Brando was great as J.o.r E.l. But Russell C.r.o.w.e. is better. Glenn Ford was great as John Kent. But Kevin Costner is better. No Superman movie has more action then this one. The Superman movie are some of the best action movies ever.",
        "Lots of superhero fans here saying that it is underrated. It may well be underrated compared to the unfairly bumped up ratings of comic book movies as a whole (Spiderman No Way Home at 8.5, I mean pleeeease). But for its place amongst the entirety of cinema, 7.1 is generous. It is watchable for non super hero fanboys/girls, and that is saying a fair bit as so many others are just not watchable (e.g. Batman vs Superman, Venom 2, Morbius, etc). The first hour was a half decent character development of Superman's origins. But the last half of the movie did metaphorically go off into space and lost all sense of character and believability. Henry Cavill is not a great actor but he is likeable that is something.",
        "For me, one of biggest, highly successful and best action movie by far! Some people might not like too much action, but we can't always have movie with lack of action, it's about adventure, explosion, and firework!\n\nDon't worry about what other people say, I love original superman and I love man of steel even more.\n\nThe story was outstanding, the characters was brilliant and action was shocking and unbelievable.\n\nVery impressed and can't wait to see the next one.\n\nWell done to everyone based on their work with man of steel",
        "I really liked this back in 2013. Then I watched a movie I did NOT like (The Arrival). Then I researched this Man Of Steel. Well I know where they came up with The Arrival. Man Of Steel is the alien version of Superman. Yes this movie is still better than Superman Returns.",
        "Love the dramatic side and getting to know Clark Kent on an emotional level. Great cinematography too. Henry does a great job.",
        "Absolutely hated this. Some parts of the story line were pretty good, but the special effects and battle scenes were incredibly amateurish and over done. Years ago, I had a game called Rock 'em, Sock 'em Robots. This movie reminded me of that game. On and on, and just when you think it's over, there's more of the same. Just badly done special effects, trying to paper over the lack of any real substance. Especially bad is the tornado scene. In 1939, they depicted a tornado better in the Wizard of Oz than they did in this movie. As for the acting -- this movie doesn't require great acting. I thought everyone handled their parts fairly well. And Henry Cavill did a reasonably good job. He certainly has the looks. But, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",
        "The movie does not hide the process of becoming superman. An the path to true great value is when faced with great trials.\n\nYou become it in the process of time. You cannot be good when you have not been tested and when you failed how did you respond. It shows us the concept of sacrifice and will to do what it takes. This is not a fully fleshed superman but one still in his growing process. Watching it from that perspective makes be the movie it is. Many complaints is about a fully fleshed superman but if they did pay attention it's obvious his growing into that arc of a character with good values and actions. This is like the making process.",
        "A film with extraordinary range in as much as it ranges from poor to very poor. So ill-conceived, unimaginative, badly written and directed it becomes tiresome after as little as the first fifteen minutes. By the half-hour mark you will already feel like you've spent an interminable wet weekend locked in a caravan with somebody else's seven obnoxious children, all of them screaming and throwing their toys at you.\n\nI fought my way to the end of this movie so you don't have to. Trust me, you will be missing NOTHING. If this is DC's challenge to the Marvel empire, they have nothing to fear.",
        "Zack snider is more of an artist than a film maker,, i guess he visualizes scenes, draws it and goes on to make every scene beautiful to the eyes, though he cant make it feel beautiful, thats where he is falling,\n\nman of steel has many layers to it, the atmosphere of krypton, civil war on krypton, pre birth of kal-el, post birth, kal-el's arrival on earth, his childhood, growing up years, adulthood and his isolating from outer world, realizing his power, motive to be superman, his reporter clark kent life, love life, love towards parents, then his fight against his gene kryptonians, his will to save earth, sacrifice n guilt after killing his lineage n etc\n\nall these things zack tries to put one after other piece by piece which makes film long and sometimes patched, but sense them all together and realise the excellence of the film, a must watch",
        "Good but not what it could have been. Too much CGI, especially the last 20 minutes. Harry Lennix (the general) is an AWFUL actor and destroys any scene he is in. Just a terrible actor and even though he has a limited role he still takes away from the movie. Finally, the scene with Superman destroying the spy drone was ridiculous and out of place.\n\nHow to make this a 9.5 movie - less CGI (edit the final fight scene), edit out the stupid drone scene, and remove Harry Lennix and you have a decent movie!\n\nYes, Lennix is THAT bad!\n\nThank you.",
        "Superman is good guy, this remake of SuperMan is definitely science fiction as well. To us humans the alien planet Kryton landscaped scenes are spectacular.",
        "Have high expectations when you watch this movie, as it won't go wasted. A humanity-believable approach to a super human character makes the movie different from existing super-man movies.\n\nIts not about the special-effects you get to watch, but the story and the character makes a perfect sense to the situations demonstrated.\n\nThe movie is very fast paced, and we won't feel a single character or dialog misplaced for a given situation. It gives more satisfaction than the movie Avengers or I would say it would be on par with The Dark Knight.\n\nGo and enjoy your weekend with the Man of Steel and never miss it in cinemas in 3D.",
        "I just watched this film and could not believe how bad the second part got, how this got over 7 is stupid as this is one of the worse big releases in years. the second half was nothing but CGI special effects with all the humanity of the earlier films missing, I wanted the baddies to win it got that bad, I did not hang around for the end and the earlier films made this look like a complete load of rubbish. I just wanted the simpler and far better Christopher Reeve films back this is simply a poor CGI fest with a shocking storyline. How did this movie do so well it was boring\n\nBack to the drawing board",
        "What happened to good dialogue? Good character development? Must it all be special effects and action? Actually, the first 45 minutes were good.\n\nThe last 2/3 of the movie was almost all action. I guess this is what people want. I will never understand this. I get no enjoyment from watching buildings explode.\n\nThe writers should take a note from Superman I. In that movie, there was great banter between Gene Hackman and Ned Beatty. There was the cute awkwardness of Clark Kent in the newsroom. Superman I did NOT have much action. I understand these movies need some action. why so much? Superman is the greatest super hero. and this movie could have been great. but they ruined it with way too much special effects and action.",
        "First DCEU movie wasn't disappointing at all, as some people say. For me, this movie has everything anyone wants in any movie.\n\nThe action sequences mixed with a great CGI, with one of the greatest soundtracks of all the time, and for sure, a great reason for everything, and that creates a spectacular story! With a great performances! Well, that what I meant to say by saying \"this movie has everything anyone wants in any movie\".\n\nI guess I said all I want to say..\n\nMan of Steel deserves a 10/10!",
        "This seems to be a very polarizing movie. I watched it a couple of years ago but still remember how many times it took to get all the way through it. Also this was my first real experience with Cavill, who isn't an actor so much as he is a cardboard cutout with one expression he has mastered and uses in every scene of every movie he's in. Skip it.",
        "Where do I begin? This is most certainly the best version superman. This movie was nearly perfect with great cinematography, excellent acting and superb special effects. I am a huge superman fan and let me tell you this movie does the best superhero of all time great justice. The action scene were beyond epic. When they would just you just stare at the screen speechless like did that just happen? This movie makes the 2006 Superman returns look like a college project and makes the 1978 Superman look like a parody. Everything fell in place great. I love everyone's performances; Russel Crowe, Henry Caville, Keven Costner, Diane Lane and Amy Adams.They were all phenomenal. This is honestly my new favorite move. If you haven't seen it yet, don't walk, RUN TO THE THEATERS NOW AND SEE IT!!!!!",
        "A movie that didn't make any impact. I felt it extremely boring and repetition of what we have already seen in Thor (2011). The action sequences were too bad and not engaging. I would advise to avoid this flick.",
        "I am a HUGE Superman Fan, watched all the Superman films over a hundred times and also showed them to my children. But I felt CHEATED watching this movie. The Filmmakers think that by showing us CGI EFFECTS all WHISHY WOOSHY and we would be impressed? I don't think so. The movie felt so rushed and all over the place. I felt that I had seen all the scenes already (SEE SUMMARY) The movie jumped from scene to scene with no logic or hope?! When the movie ended I was like \"WHAT JUST Happened\". No character development, no nothing. And to top it all off I felt so compelled to write this review as my 1st review after being a member of IMDb since 1998! That's how strongly I feel!!! I will give it a 3 out of 10 because I liked the soundtrack.",
        "Another action-money spreading big time failure film. Total waste of time, worse superman film ever. Moreover I think it would be a way much better film with those actors if they went to Las Vegas for a geek weekend. To have all those good actors and make such bad scenario is unacceptable in my opinion. Film was boring from the the beginning till the end. I just waited for something to happen, to thrill etc. Nothing. With all due respect, it was one of those films that made me feel guilty for not leaving instead watching till the end. I relied on high votes on IMDb.com and wished that I stopped watching at first 10 minutes. Long and boring action scenes, boring scenario and all..",
        "Where do i begin with how much i live this film! Lets start at the simple, direct easy to follow plot that had zero, make that zero plot holes. Iron man and star trek both had more plot holes that i could count. They ruined those films because your taken out of those worlds because something stupid happens like blowing up armour and teleporters that work between planets . In superman, i was never taken out of it ever. Every move makes sense. Every action has a reason, purpose and consequence. All is explained to a satisfactory level.\n\nThe action and fights were exactly what we wanted to see, on an epic scale worthy of 2013 and beyond.\n\nI love this film, and thank everyone so, so much for making it. This is my new all time number 1 favourite film of all time.",
        "This is truly a great reboot of the Superman series of films. It shows a far more in-depth portrayal of how Superman came to be, showing the loneliness that an alien to another world would feel & how one would try to blend in. It also treats the hero as a god like creature, as indeed anyone with the powers he has compared to mankind would be treated. This is greatly shown in the fight scenes against Zod and his crew. The fight scenes are epic as would be the case if two gods were to fight each other. It's far more epic in its destruction than was shown in the Christopher Reeves adaptations, which were rather somewhat cleaner, tidier and somehow more clinical. Where perhaps this film does fall down is for a start there's no memorable theme tune. And you don't tend to feel the love, warmth & calmness of Supermans father, which Marlon Brando portrayed so excellently, indeed at times in doesn't even seem to matter that Jor-El played by Russell Crowe dies, as his body and mind work perfectly well afterwards, even being able to walk about! This version however does bring back the magic of Superman to a new audience, and the imagination of children can once again run wild as they reinact their hero across many school playgrounds.",
        "Man of Steel divides critics. Some of them considers this movie great, some debunks the movie overloaded with effect rumble. I think that Man of Steel is at least great, maybe even awesome reboot of Superman saga. I can't deny that the effects grow quite epic at the end of the movie, but then again - so what? You can find many similarities with Batman movies, but that is quite clear with Christopher Nolan on the background: the one who rebooted Batman so well. Henry Cavill is a gret choice for role of Superman, not just because a great body of his, he looks quite hot in his tight Superman outfit. Luckily they have renewed Supermans outfit and he doesn't have to wear those ugly red underpants anymore. Russel Crowe is a good choice for Jor El and Kevin Costner fits in his role as a Clark's foster father. Michael Shannon is great as a psychotic general Zod. Movie looks great as so many other Zack Snyder movie. Effets are great to watch and that emphazises effect rumble at the end part of the movie. Scenery at planet Krypton looks fantastic in the beginning of the movie. This is quite great rebooting and can't wait to see the sequel which is already announced with Zack Snyder directing it. Definitely worth of price of a movie ticket.",
        "Just watched the movie. The good things first, Henry Cavill is great as Superman. The visual effects are spectacular and some of the changes made to the Superman folklore was surprisingly refreshing, IMHO. Having said that I found the movie to be a bit unsatisfying. Once the action starts its goes on forever and is kind of monotonous. The supporting characters are not very well developed ,but given that its just the first of the series(reboot) it can be ignored, I guess. My biggest gripe is that it does not contain enough thrills of a superhero movie (other than the elongated fight scene). Coming from the people behind the Dark Knight series, it just does not stand up to the standards.\n\nOverall I gave it 7/10",
        "This movie is not in any way related to the true Superman. Idiot cavill looks like nothing more than a psychotic violent lunatic, and is the worst superman in history. In truth, Eva Gabor would have made a better superman, and she has been dead since 1995. Disgusting cavill simply sucks, as does that ugly wench that thinks she can be wonder woman. And before you start, I did not capitalize the hero names nor that piece of filth actor that plays supes, for the simple reason that with these ugly freaks, the names no longer have any meaning to anyone with a brain, (and I simply hate and would love to see that freak die in a car wreck like that disgusting piece of crap that played the worst joker in history). No more DC movies for me. They just simply suck.",
        "This movie was way better than I expected. Superman was well played. When I went into the movie I was expecting it to be the same plot as the original and I was surprised in a good way that the movie was about as far from the original as you can get. The movie jumped right into the story and didn't take thirty minutes just telling us about his childhood. Instead it kind of filled us in about his childhood and his adopted father. When The movie would have a long intense moment in the middle of it there would be a comical relief whether it was I sign or a person. You wouldn't always see it but it was there. The first fifteen minutes of the movie was him shirtless, which didn't have to be there but I'm not complaining. The movie focused more on the relationship between Louis and Clark than it was in the original. They basically made the Louis in this movie an upgraded version of the past Louise's. if u haven't seen it go see it",
        "I've always enjoyed Superman movies in the past...., that is when the CG is not like what we have in our movies today. This particular Superman is a a plot that is bit different than their predecessors in term of their stories, but still overall the story is okay. What get's me is the CGI on the movie. It's just too much CGI and the Hollywood recipe of panic has always been the same. People panicking and that is okay, but the fact that they wait until the last moment before they run away from a cataclysmic event is beyond my understanding. Come on, I know this is just a movie but why not make it more realistic. People do not normally wait for something to come down on them, but they try to avoid the danger. When you see building all around you are being destroyed, you do not wait until the building next or the one you are one is being hit. And there is one thing with all the Superman movies. Is it logical that you can not recognize a person just because he or she is taking off his or her glasses ? I don't think so...",
        "This is not as Super as the Christopher Reeves Superman films but it is a pretty good superhero movie to watch on the comic book hero Superman.\n\nThey do go fairly far in-depth about Superman and his history - it's more of a look at Superman's family and personal history to me than a film that is all about his adventures and heroism on planet earth - at least that is what I got out of the film.\n\nIt's one of the better modern superhero movies to me. I liked the slightly different take on the Superman story.\n\nChristopher Reeves will always be my movie Superman - but this one it pretty good.\n\n7.5/10",
        "Despite all the hypes, I don't think the movie really worth a second watch. Yeah it's a different take from the common \"superheroes\" theme and a little darker from the original Superman, but it doesn't really makes the movie outstanding. There are few things that didn't make sense. I found myself thinking \"wtf, why they do that? why they didn't do this etc\" many times throughout the movie. I can't say what they are without giving out spoilers though.\n\nThe fighting scene? Typical, boring, nothing new. You may watch the movie for special effects, but even that is nothing new. I give the movie 5 for decent acting. None of them irritates me, at least not much.",
        "This is the film that got me into Superman, before this I didn't care for him as much as I should have but Zack Snyder changed that. One of the best solo/origin superhero pictures ever created. It is a utterly riveting cinema experience.",
        "A middling addition to the comic book cinematic universe. Henry Cavill is a dignified superman trapped in a movie devoid of personality. DC Comics is trying to cash in on the dark macabre spirit of its most successful installment, the Dark Knight trilogy. A grim comic book reboot isn't always the ticket to success, as seen in this film. The action scenes are well directed and engaging, but the film lacks power and emotional investment. The lack of proper pacing is conspicuous, which is invariably the result of relentless attempts to make the film darker. Man of Steel has all the spectacle of Superman, but lacks its heart. The excellent Michael Shannon also feels wasted in a poorly constructed and poorly written character.",
        "The first half of Man of Steel is a great movie -- the second half, however, is only mediocre at best. Oddly enough, the most boring parts of this movie are the fighting scenes, which is strange because Zack Snyder normally knows how to direct action sequences. Also, this movie tries to be too dark for its own good, so when they try for lighthearted humor, it feels out of place. I wanted to like this movie more than I did.",
        "The first 30 mins was epic zack did it very well and the rest of the movie was good also but unfortunately the rest of the squeals ( BVS & justise leauge ) wasn't that good and leak of good story",
        "trying to reinterpret the original story just makes it feel forced and makes it a drag. Reinventing the story just for the sake of reinventing without any merits. I would very much have liked brandon routh playing superman once more with more traditional looking superman suit. storyline feels forced and unnatural. second half of the film is just full of noise, destruction, needlessly long fight scenes just to show off cgi. I can't understand people who rate this film better than Superman Returns. That one wasn't perfect but it had certain class and artistry. don't see it. not worth your time. not worth your time not worth you",
        "Warner Bros was so proud of Zack Snyder's work of 300 and Watchmen, they decided to give him a chance was Superman. As a comic book fan of the character and while I did wanted to see something different outside of the Christopher Reeves version, this movie just wasn't the Superman film I wanted to see.\n\nAside from few good casting for the role, some good effects and some good action sequences that doesn't cost property damage or innocent lives and the weird zooming in and out camera motion. The whole movie suffers with bad writing, bad editing for the subplot and no connection with the characters.",
        "Frankly I'm not a real fan of Superman not until I saw the name of Christopher Nolan(Man of Inception) in the first teaser, I made myself an 'instant' fan of this Superhero.. Nolan's brilliant storyline plus with David Goyer's excellent screenplay, Zack Snyder managed to pull this off impressively.. Spectacular visuals and CGI effects just breathtaking.. Hans Zimmer compose was majestic right till the end.. Steelman Henry Cavill fits the Superhero role almost perfectly.. The battle scenes with Zod(Micheal Shannon)probably some of the best you would ever witness(IronMan what)?? Strong supporting cast of Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne all delivered subtly.. Hats off to Nolan, Goyer and Snyder for the reboot!! Ignore the haters and critics, just go watch and be blown away effortlessly!! Movie of the summer definitely!! 9.5/10!!",
        "For me, DC has always carried more weight than Marvel. While Marvel was mesmerizing us with effects, and with the spectacular action imbued with humor was covering up the shallowness of the story, DC was making more serious and deeper films. Then at one point, they decided to get into a race with Marvel, taking over their style. To me, the new Superman looks more like Marvel than DC, and more of a classic space SF than a superhero movie. Technically, it's amazing, but I wouldn't be able to recount it in detail, even though I watched it yesterday. It made absolutely no impression. Fun for one watching, but without any weight and forgettable. The only pleasure I got from this movie is the sweetness of Amy Adams.\n\n7/10 (for the visual spectacle)",
        "I did not like this Superman movie. It is laced with unbelievable violence and this movie should be a PG 14. It is not the superman I remember from movies with Christopher Reeves. Not my cup of tea",
        "Forget about this being bad as a Superman film. It's just a bad film period. The washed out looking flashbacks and senseless violence are enough to do me in. It just doesn't feel or look right. From the first 5 minutes on Krypton I could tell that this was going to be a stinker. I cannot believe how many people are giving this film a good review. I surely hope that this isn't the start of a bigger film universe. I would hate to see Wonder Woman mucked up just as badly. To summarize-do not see this movie. Avoid it all costs. It is poison to the good name of Superman. Do not let this be your kids first impression of Superman. Show them the original film, and cartoons, and comics. This film will taint their whole perspective on Supes otherwise",
        "Man of steel is a movie that had some surprises but also some misstapes in it,lets start with cavill i think that he wasnt right pick to play either clark or superman,i found him to be to emotional distant,without personality and he lacked that bright and hopeful nature that kal el has and that reeve showed so brilliant,but some moments with him were good like fight scenes and some badass moments and lines,adams as lois was good but her chemistry with clark was non existent,i found battle scenes to be one of best i ever saw in comic book genre,and they reminded me of dragon ball in a good way,men of steel was fine superhero flick but it lacks material to be something more",
        "Yeah... I have an issue with Superman Dark, I'm sorry, it just doesn't work for me. Batman, yeah, you can make him dark. Batman can be brooding. Batman can be extremely serious.\n\nIn fact, with the exception of Mayor Adam West's Batman, making the character light and fun doesn't really work.\n\nBut this is Superman, and he is a light character. You can make serious Superman stories, you can make dark superman stories, and they work... but not when you make Superman a dark and brooding character.\n\nWhen that happens, it feels like Man of Steel, a superman movie that is trying really hard to be Batman.",
        "On the distant, ill-fated planet of Krypton a devoted scientist jettisons his newborn son across the galaxy in the desperate hope that his life will be the key to preserving the Kryptonian race. Having landed safely on Earth and been adopted by two loving parents, the boy struggles to adapt to human life while always painfully aware of the external limits of his extraordinary abilities. It's not until years later\u2014as a man\u2014that he begins to fully embrace his extraterrestrial heritage with the very fate of the Earth hanging in the balance. Reimagining of sorts of the iconic DC Comics character is much more serious and somber in both its tone and characterizations than previous renditions, but there's still plenty to please with fantastic visual effects, soaring action scenes, and compelling human drama. Film's unremitting climatic action sequences border on superfluous, yet remain exciting and fun to watch. Pumped-up Cavill definitely looks the part, but the real acting highlights are veterans Costner and especially Crowe as his adoptive and biological fathers. ***",
        "I don't know how people loved this movie. From my point of view the story have no sense, the story in Smallville y much better than this one. Now I understand why Christian Bale don't wanna be in a Superman/Batman because Batman story will be killed. I didn't understand the scene where he was fishing and then was in water and began the flashbacks...\n\nAs far as I know, Jor-El always was a voice in the fortress, and in this movie he was like a ghost.\n\nI spected more argument for the movie, it was just like Superman before one.\n\nI wonder why all DC movies are crap (excep for Batman).",
        "Not really a Superman movie. That is another superhero with red cloak and black hair. I prefer, by far, \"Superman returns\" and, off course, Christopher Reeve's first two films. In \"Man of Steel\", the history of Krypton looks like \"Brave New World\" of Aldous Huxley. Clark Kent as a child and as a teenager resembles the one from \"Smallvile\". But where is Clark Kent, the shy journalist? Where is that superhero worried about hurting human beings while fighting the enemy? The only thing I believe this film brought better than all the previous ones is not the way they showed Krypton (I didn't like it very much) or a deeper exploration of Kal-El's personality (I expected this but I didn't see it), but Faora-Ul, a nice character (better than Ursa, the female partner of Zod in Superman II).\n\nTherefore, this is not a bad film, but it isn't a movie true to the character, and that is not due to the revisionist uniform (which I also disliked). I expected much more of Zack Snyder, who brilliantly directed the fabulous \"Watchmen\".",
        "This is one movie that truly deserves a sequel. After all these years I still believe this is one of the greatest comic book movies, with Zack Snyders vision along with an incredible score. This is everything a superman movie should be.",
        "This time its different. The older parts kinda start off where this one ends. The only real complaint i could make would be this tried to capture way too much in it. It gives a realistic picture of what little Clark must've really gone through and being a superhero isn't all fun and games. But it would be practically impossible to raise him, he'd destroy the house and maybe his parents, only while playing. Don't want the audience sympathysing with him. We know its all impossible, we are looking for a hero and more or less get it later in the film. The setting of the origins was good. Storyline quite good. Plot development good. The action seemed over at times, too many buildings destroyed. But come'on its Superman, what were you expecting? Maybe could trim the length a bit, but i couldn't complaint more. Take out the time and buy a ticket. Its may not be the best Superhero movie ever, but you'll get your moneys worth.",
        "I hated this movie. I thought I was watching The Avengers, and I despised that movie. I bet Nolan had zero contribution to this film, I bet they just put his name to build up hype. I blame Zack first then Gaya or Goya whatever his name is. Stupid story, loud music, Michael Bay-like explosions, stupid stupid stupid! Admittedly, I hate superhero movies, I like Nolan's touch which is not present here at all. I hope they don't make Man Of Steel 2. I hate Avengers 2.0!!!! The acting was not bad actually. Btw I am writing this review while watching it at the cinema. *sigh* I always have trouble with the 10 lines thing. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......",
        "Storyline and technology are now up to date.\n\n3D and XD enhanced audio theater were perfect, well worth it.\n\nEmotional depth of characters developed and appreciated. This is a change from Superman movies of the past, earning extra points for \"Man of Steel.\"\n\nIntense cinematography, new weapons, new vulnerabilities and perfect casting.\n\nSuperman has always been my favorite. A few moderate political messages were okay for all. One of the people that saw it with me mentioned some subtle religious parallels. I say - maybe.\n\nThe audience had much to talk about after the show, I could tell they liked this movie too. I give 10/10.",
        "Wow it was a good movie just hated some part of it and for the other dc movies please do not change the director",
        "I saw this film with my grandson. I'm a Henry Cavill fan and was anxious to see how he did. He acquitted himself quite well, even to his American accent. I didn't mind the darkness of the film. It made sense that Kal would have a lot of questions about himself and his origins and the film did that well, I thought. The back and forth of time frames was a little off putting, but worked.\n\nIf I have any criticism, it's that the battle scenes went on too long. They could have been cut back and the movie wouldn't have suffered for it. Also, it was the loudest film I've seen since the Who's Tommy and believe me ,that's saying something. I think that my ears were bleeding by the time the credits rolled. I would look forward to a sequel to see how Clark continues to try and fit in on Earth. I also liked Amy Adams portrayal of Lois Lane.",
        "Great film, Great actor and wonderfull music and atmosphere",
        "While definitely a darker retelling of the classic story (akin to \"Batman Begins\"), this film kind of dragged on a bit, partly due to its well paced flashback sequences and its lengthy exposition. Still, for those who are looking for some dizzying action sequences, this is your movie. The hand-to-hand combat was awesome, but it was certainly on a scale of sensory overload (I would not have liked to have even thought about seeing this in 3-D because of this fact). And overall, the relational aspects made a lot of the characters (even the ones from Earth) seem flat and not very human. But yeah, if you're looking for a summer action flick, this is your best bet.",
        "(50%) Not willing to do what 2012's Amazing Spiderman did and simply tell the exact same story again only with minor changes, this instead tries to gloss over much of the origin story with scenes of Clark as a child at school and his earth parents discovering him etc cut into the movie (or cut out completely) in a non linear fashion, as the fact is we have seen it all this before, we know all about it, and the writers know we know it. Cavill looks the part, but Christopher Reeve will always be the best Superman and the relationship between Lois and Clark is hugely underdeveloped. As flashy effects ridden, money thrown at the screen action movies go this is enjoyable and well worth a look, but as a well rounded film there's just not enough depth to see here, mainly because it has already been done more than a couple of times before.",
        "It takes a minute to realize this take is not a tune-up of the last few failed Superman movies. They sold the old car for scrap and traded in for a V-8 muscle car. Will everyone like it? No. But not everyone likes the rumble and speed of a Chevelle. But those who do appreciate seeing a real comic book fight come to life ( sorry Avengers ) will see the first truly realized meta human brawl. And it is breathtaking. Don't expect the Superman of 1978, but honestly does he have a place in our breakneck speed world? The core values will always have a place, and they still do here. Kal-El still saves as many humans as he can, still stays humble when he should, and still represents the best in us. But this time he does it with some spectacle. With some power and speed. Like a real life Superhero would.",
        "If you are DC fan, loved the new grater and darker version of Batman, then you will love this film. I don't understand why people complain about underwear or underestimate. Let's say it, Bane is a great comic character but in a movie? It would be just stupid. Same is when we're talking about superman. Superman is a brilliant comic character but how can you be underestimated about this movie? I know why people hate superman, they say that he's like god and it's pretty stupid but here, it was scientifically rightly explained everything. You ask about graphics, i answer Zack Snyder, you say story was bad, i say Christopher Nolan.\n\nOne word : EPIC!!!",
        "Someone should forbid Zack Snyder from making movies.",
        "I must confess I'm getting a bit lost as to where we're up to these days with all the movie franchise reboots. This was the first of the new Superman movies. I have seen it in both 3d IMAX and 2d normal. Apart from a couple of scenes I can't say that the 3d IMAX really made a big difference visually.\n\nFor the time being Superman is Kal-El and played by Henry Cavill. Sure most people will be familiar with the background story of how Superman came to arrive on Earth. In this movie he is followed by General Zod in a quest for revenge and to transform earth into a Krypton like world.\n\nPersonally I liked the scenes of Clark Kent as a youngster with father Jonathon (Kevin Costner) the best. The whole movie and the finale in particular will be real eye candy for the adrenalin junkies, so if that's what floats your boar go and see man of Steel.",
        "This was a brilliant movie! When I first saw the previews I knew it would be a deeper, darker emotionally impacting movie and was not disappointed! Henry Cavill is an excellent and handsome superman who really brings character depth to the hero. I wasn't overly thrilled or disappointed with the lead female character but the rest of the cast was amazing. Well done Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner! This is the Superman for adults. Wonderful graphics, in depth storyline and memorable characters and plots. I can't wait to see the next adventure of Superman and hope Henry Cavill will reprise his role for future projects! We'll see how long these can go :)",
        "Remember Superman? The positive, confident and ethically thoughtful superhero that embodies everything that is good? Well, take those positive triads away, make him gloomy, dark, full of doubt and confusion, add a mediocre script that does not make a lot of sense and systematically deconstructs him as a flawed and mentally unstable dangerous menace and you have the Man of Steel.\n\nBest part is the CGI which has a old movie quality to it which is hard to do, but as for the writing or acting, my god, Cavile could not act his way out of a wet paper bag! What a boring plank of wood that guy is!, there isn't much to really like.\n\nActually I was kind of rooting for the baddies so it would be over soon and this dumb fictional universe got the empty and pointless dystopia it deserves! (Yes, i just wished ill on a planet of fictional people, but they are horrid!)",
        "I bet most of the reviews were written by woman....! I am only watching this because my son asked if he could watch it, I gave up after an hour and 50 minutes. It's so stupid, so over the top, so fogged to death, so American, I mean the Americans invented everything, even oxygen, I can't wait for the planet to be attached by aliens because it's only the Americans that would be in danger.",
        "A remake from the 1978 film, starring Marlon Brando, Gener Hackman as Lex Luthor and Christopher Reeve as Kal-El or Superman. One of the most expected movies of the years specially since the Avengers franchise has turned out to be a complete success. Unfortunately, Man of Steel did not fill the expectations of fans. Saturated with Special Effects up to the point where you do not know if you are watching Transformers or Matrix. Difficult to catch up, specially for new fans who were not familiar with the story, using flashbacks of Kal-El's past. Lack of expectation when Superman shows up, and is considered to be a dangerous alien, instead of a Superheroe. Russel Crowe is good as Jor-El, Kevin Kostner is a waste as Kent's father, due to the lack of appearance. Henry Cavill the best choice to play Superman. The movie not good.",
        "Watching this after Justice League really puts into perspective the difference between a standalone film, and on that's meant to launch an extended universe. This was great on it's own. I would have loved to have seen a Superman only sequel.",
        "Wow, I'm shocked at how much I disliked this movie. If you were fortunate enough to grow up with Donner's joyful and poetic Superman and Superman II, this hot mess remake comes across like some horrible CGI mash-up of those two films, told - to no benefit - out of sequence, and with absolutely NO sense of humor. This lame movie will likely only please the tragic generation of kids raised on CGI video games and with no grasp of wit. None of the cast need be ashamed - they all come across fine, especially Adams, Lane and Shannon - but Henry Cavill made no real impression. The biggest offender, however, is the director. Zach Snyder should be ashamed. Ever heard of a steadicam? Or master shot? You spazzy fool.",
        "I actually debated a while before rating this movie even a six. I always knew Snyder had an over-the-top style with his directing, but this went miles and miles over the proverbial top. The total and utter carnage of this movie will make you feel like road kill when its all said and done. I just wish Costner and Crowe hadn't been associated with a film like this one. It was a total waste of their acting prowess. All Snyder seemed to worry about was how to \"up\" his next explosion and/or fighting sequence. I kept thinking, by the end of the movie, what did Superman actually \"save\" (and not destroy)?? Amy Adams character might as well have been deleted from the movie altogether. She served, through poor screen writing and directing, no purpose whatsoever. I don't worry about Affleck playing Batman in the next installment. I worry about Snyder directing it again. I think he needs to take a lesson from Superman and fly away.",
        "Man Of Steel by Zack Snyder is by far one of the best superhero movies of 2013 as it renews our perspective of superman, giving the audience a more realistic and modernized version. The film is full of metaphors and while some struggle to understand the message behind this story, it is pretty clear to me what the movie is saying. Snyder's film removes the sugar coating from Reeve's superman and tries to integrate superman into a modern society who have different opinions. I believe the reason why this movie got a 56% rating is because most are used to the innocence of the 70's superman and cannot seem to let go of the past as we head into a new society. Also this superman is not as Americanized as previous movies which allows a wider audience to relate to the man of steel.",
        "Just walked out of this movie. as in I walked out 30 minutes into it and got my money back. The story as a whole looked like it might end up being decent but the whole movie was shaky cam. didn't matter if it was two people sitting on a couch talking or bus crashing, I felt like I had to put my wallet in the camera man's mouth to make sure he didn't swallow his tongue. Not to mention scene were out of focus and the zoom was full throttle (Russell Crow has a very porous face. Must be his lotion) The acting was well done and most of the dialog was spot on and believable. The Directing made it unwatchable, which is unfortunate. I liked Snyder's past movies. Save your money, sadly not worth seeing.",
        "The movie was overall good, the story is more detailed and there are minor changes which make it very interesting. A lot of action, hardly a boring moment in the film. I really love the actors that play superman and lois lane. They make a very cute couple. Looking forward to see the sequel Batman vs Superman.",
        "First contact with aliens but, the alien is Superman. Such a brilliant idea. A really great starting point and then they kill it. Theres good things here, Cavill is likeable with what little he has to work with, Michael Shannon and Antje Traue both good villians. The first flight is nicely done. And thats mostly it save for the odd bit here and there. Amy Adams is a bad Lois Lane, the set pieces are generic and dull. Its bog standard cgi action for the majority of the second half of the picture. Everything could have been built upon and improved in a sequel but we got Batman vs Superman instead which doubled down on everything that doesn't work here. Would still like to see Cavill get another run out in the suit, preferably with a better writer and director behind him.",
        "A good reboot to the most powerful superhero movie.. Henry Cavil is fit for the role of Superman, his physique is perfect for the superman.. he bring life in to this movie while the soul created by Russell Crowe (Jor-El),Kevin Costner(Jonathan Kent) and Diane Lane(Martha Kent). This movie goes to the dark side like 'Dark knight' rather than the fun side of 'The Avangers'. There is a Nolan touch in the story, great performance by the cast the main antagonist in this movie Michael Shannon (General Zod) delivers a reliable performance to his character. He has a reason for everything he is doing. Brilliant visual affect and nice action.. 3D doesn't give much to this movie... we can expect a great sequel to this movie like Nolan's 'Dark knight' to 'Batman begins'..",
        "Fun to watch, don't know why but saw it in several pieces. Good remember if I already had seen it. A good 7",
        "This was one of the most tedious spectacular turkeys of the summer. I was in awe of just how bad. I had that feeling after reading numerous movie critics say how it lacked pretty much everything a Superman movie should be and not enough to make a good superhero movie. Regardless I kept an open mind and was really shocked at just how lame and overwrought this movie was. It was full of clich\u00e9s and made little sense most of the time. Nothing the characters did made any sense. At the end of the film one person clapped in the whole theater and all I wanted was the over 2 hours of my life back. I was especially stunned that Christopher Nolan was a part of this really bad film. I realize he was not directing it but it is so bad I can't believe he wouldn't want his name taken out of the credits.",
        "Bad casting, no chemistry between the leads, and boring plotline make this completely unwatchable. Henry Cavill sounds like Beetlejuice, looks too short, and doesn't have enough presence.",
        "just watched this movie for the second time ... the first words out of my mouth after watching it is ( is it me or Hollywood is getting more and more better ? ) .\n\nforget the old Superman Movies , this movie is a must see , everything in its right place , the acting , the cast , the sound effects , all have done a wonderful combination to bring this movie into the light . whole new story with a whole new action scenes , with a brilliant cast combined together . 8 out of 10 , and watch it if you got the chance :-) put it up , suite up and have some popcorn , 2 hours and 20 minutes of joyful thrill in your way , buckle up and enjoy the ride ... don't miss it in 3D :-)",
        "Unfortunately i had high expectations from this movie. I decided to type my first review ever in order to let people know what to expect from this film.I just thought a superman movie with that cast had to be good. How wrong was i! Although in the first bit of the movie everything was going OK, after a while the plot collapsed and it ended up being another action film with loads of fights, sound effects, explosions etc. I wanted to watch more stuff about the characters and their lives.Its nothing like Batman. If you want to watch an action movie go for it. If you want to watch a superman i suggest you watch again the one with Christopher Reeve from 1978.",
        "\"Man of Steel\" from DC movies was something I expected to be good. It was OK, but there were long periods of utter boredom and slush, not to mention that some action scenes are just a blur of \"something happening\", such was the speed of the action. Ridiculously fast footage, which was hard to see exactly what was supposed to be happening. There are a lot of big name actors in this movie, so the viewer is to think that this movie will be a cracker; unfortunately it is not that good. It is OK, but in reality, it is just a repetitive storyline; hero emerges, hero gets beaten to pulp by baddie, hero makes a sudden come back, the earth is saved. Average movie.",
        "I really thought this was bad. The 2 is for the audacity of this. This is nothing short of a CGI orgy. This requires you to have knowledge of Superman to begin with just so it can tell you everything you know is wrong. Superman in the past has been a bit of a bland character but Christopher Reeve has about 20 times the charisma that Henry Cavill brings to the role. Amy Adam's who I usually think is good is equally as un charming as Lois Lane. Russel Crowe as Jor El looks like he has at least seen the 1978 movie is about the best thing in it. Krypton is totally re imagined complete with mystical flying beasts. One of the worst big budget blockbusters of this century or any century.",
        "The film feels like a lot of it got cut out and the film was edited together with music and ended up feeling like a never ending trailer.\n\nThe first time I can cite pacing issues and actually mean it. The film is stunning to look at it, but the film doesn't really have a conversation until the last act, it's insane. The film also does a crazy amount of expositions because it wants to be an origin story, but doesn't have the balls to be a character piece.\n\nThe film has these great action set pieces, but when you see other people are in danger around Superman, you care very little, because the film spent no time developing any of the side characters. The film is clich\u00e9, generic, formulaic, and just isn't a lot of fun. I wouldn't have mind a character piece, but the film instead tries to be just another action film, but without the boisterous pleasure of something like The Avengers or Spiderman 2.",
        "Best Superman Film Ever. Excellent special effects with super speed and super powers. Hope to see a sequel very soon. The Actors have been chosen very wisely. The storyline is not complex. The ideals of Superman (Goodness, helpfulness, non provocativeness, etc.) are clearly shown throughout the Movie. The Global Outcry for Exhausting our Natural Resources are very much Addressed in the Movie. As always the movie proves the point that a child must have the parents' love and guidance achieve the best in his or her life. The movie also addresses our fear for something we don't fully understand and our constant desire to control very thing. In every way possible an excellent movie for the Best Superhero of all time.",
        "I thought that reducing the number of action sequences as compare to MCU films, of the film was a brilliant idea. It gave Man of Steel more of the needed time to establish the moral person behind Kal-El. And, those efforts at making Kal-el humane, and at exploring his psyche have bear fruit. In later films, DC has tried to do it without the collaboration of S. Goyer and Nolan, but unfortunately, the two main writers of The Dark Knight Trilogy don't seem to be replaceable.\n\nThe huge problem of this film lies within the climax. That climax is a total rip-off of Roland Emmerich's work. People are running, Metropolis is being destroyed by a giant spaceship, and Superman is bashing many, many, many buildings, going into space, destroying satellites, and returning on earth to destroy more buildings. One of the worst climax of the 2010s.",
        "Just average. Not as good as the original Superman movie. Not lots of plot. Too much fight scenes. Not enough character development. Not that emotional connection to the characters.",
        "The movie is nice but too long and the story is boring in the beginning only.",
        "I use this word \"strange.\" Only because it is really strange.\n\nThe fighting was disappointed. \"Hancock\" is much better. At least I know what they was doing. But in this film, 50% you can only tell they are jumping, flying, crashing, causing explode... last time I see a movie fight like this was \"transformer.\" Some people may be entertained by the long-term violence emotion. But that shouldn't be The story was not great. Too much political correctness. (Almost every Zack Snyder's film is too much political correctness. But this one break the record.) And not just political correctness, it is American political correctness. Don't tell me it is an American movie. There is a line between OK and NO.",
        "For me, this is the nose movie. I never saw so many ugly noses so pointed out by lights and camera angles, without intention, I mean. Besides this, any moment I expected this Steve-Carell-Superman to do something funny. I suppose it is because of his small jaw. He has the muscles, but the face is just not Superhero material. He certainly looks funny in some of the rare quiet moments. But then he never did do anything funny and that made it some kind of disappointing. Anyway, the effects are well made, but thats about all that I can say about this movie. It is just a big waste of opportunity to tell a story which for once would contain more then just the usual bashing and exploding. It is beyond me why they produce a new take about Superman again and again and each time just do it worse.",
        "Quite possibly the most boring movie I have ever watched. Seems they spent a fortune on special effects but left out all the usual things you would associate with a movie... Generally its just loud noises and ridiculous city crushing fight scenes. The story is pretty poor too. So many things that just done seem like they mix well with a Superman Movie. They should just give up and stop 're-booting' or 're-imagining' all these old movies. Try writing something Original guys. Basically this is a massively hyped movie that is made simply for big profit by big business. Throw in a load of effects to keep the fan-boys happy, as they cannot contemplate suspenseful dialog or story-lines we can relate to. So many superior movies out there made on a fraction of the budget. The star-ships etc are terrible considering the budget when compared to something like District 9. This is more Captain America than Superman.",
        "Brilliant\n\nExtends the understanding of superman perfectly\n\nI was blown away",
        "The first half was great. They did a really good job showing how things were for him as a kid to have all those powers, and I enjoyed the time spent on Krypton. However, once they started fighting, it took me about 20 minutes to realize this was going to be an endlessly painful wait until the end. If your characters are invincible, you can't have them physically fight for an hour and a half. Get creative. Gratuitously blowing up buildings for a full hour and a half is a real cop-out. So they basically wrote half a movie and forgot the rest? No thanks. I was near tears from boredom by the end. I give it a 5 because the first half of the movie was great and he was sexy as hell. I suggest leaving after the first hour if you don't want to leave angry.",
        "This film employed the free camera technique to such a high degree that I found it distracting and irritating. In my opinion, the dogged use of this camera style cheapened the the epic stature that a Superman film should have.\n\nAlso there was so much fighting. I enjoy a boxing and judo, but the after a third fight I tuned-out and drifted while waiting for the story to begin again... I don't think that the high frequency of fighting and length of each bout contributed to the storyline.\n\nIf the speed at which the men or women were fighting were slowed down and the number of fights reduced, perhaps I would have enjoyed the combat a bit more.\n\nOverall I'm glad that I saw \"Man of Steel.\"",
        "I've never been a big Superman fan. Growing up I gravitated more to Batman and Spider-Man, but this film was entertaining and the best recent DC film, just behind Wonder Woman. It is too bad, because this DC Universe has so much potential. Henry Cavill was cast perfectly for this role and I really can't see any other actor in this day and age playing the titular role. Forget what follows it and just watch this as a stand-alone film and you'll appreciate it much more.",
        "Man of Steel is just epic. I saw it the day it came out with my mother and brother. All I can saw is......wow. My goodness this movie was epic. There was nonstop fighting towards the end. Zod, the villain, could not have been portrayed better. I know he isn't like the joker for The Dark Knight, but General Zod's performance in Man of Steel was nonetheless exiting.\n\nHenry Cavill played the perfect role of Superman. It's a realistic depiction of how Superman would have been like if he were real. Henry Cavill is the best Superman in my opinion. So if you want a good superhero movie with a lot of action and a personal story, Man of Steel is your movie. (And by lots of action, I mean lots of action.)",
        "the first half of the film was AMAZING!! the pacing and everything, i cant describe it but it just felt so real and perfect. The Krypton scenes and Clark's childhood/discovering himself were worth the money. I wish it would have stayed that way the character development and connection that were being built were so strong, but then it began focusing on the action \"superhero\" part of the movie, it would've been better sticking to Clark Kent's story and learning about his life. Also the relationship between Clark and Lois started strong but never went anywhere. Zack Snyder just tried to put too much into one movie, its hard to do so I don't blame him but if he would forgot the superhero part and stuck with a character driven movie it would been in my top two favorite movies",
        "This movie was not the typical superman movie or the regular superhero movie. From storytelling to overall feeling this movie takes its own path and if you're open to a non status quo movie you'll love it! Cavill is amazing, Amy Adams makes you smile, and Costner makes your heart tear apart. The biggest complaint I've had from friends is that no kitties are saved, to that I say superman doesn't have to be light hearted all the time. He needs to provide hope and he does that in this film.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go to this and drink it in, just don't expect it to be the generic superhero movie.",
        "Now this is what super hero movies should be. Great villain, non cheesy love interest, characters you care about and no silly Gillmore Girls-esque banter. This movie made me care what happened, as did Batman vs Superman & Justice League. Yes it's dark but I don't want to see movies that are all corny jokes, rainbows and unicorns. If I wanted to see a Care Bear movie I'd watch 3/4's of the Marvel Movies (this doesn't include Dr Stange, both Deadpools or Guardians of the Galaxy/cheesy but still hilarious). Zach Snyder is an unfairly maligned genius of directing/story telling. This along with Watchmen put him in Best Director category for any comic book/superhero movies ever made.",
        "watched the best Superman Movie ever ..... Man of Steel.\n\nWhat a movie u have made Zack Snyder Couldn't have pulled of a better way to show WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ALIENS fight on earth. Total Catastrophe, Destruction and what not. WOW. I thought Predator and Alien were cool characters but Kryptonians were cool too. Christopher Nolan The story was perfectly laid and carried just like u always do.\n\nHats off to such a brilliant movie (for me at-least) and those who thought movie was nothing then just fighting and mass destruction ..then well hello people ??? these are super humans we are talking about , they won't be playing a game of LUDO when they will have to decide who gets to rule. So Yea .....",
        "I was amazed with the graphics and special effects. This is without a doubt the best superman movie till date, and it even beats all superhero movies. This had the exact amount of action which a action movie should have, not too much and not too less. For all the marvel fans out there, THE REAL hero has come, you can go hide in the blanket now.\n\nHenry surely did a pretty well job as a new comer, plus all the supporting actors. As Zack Snyder said every thing, every moment is EPIC, you haven't seen it. A movie which redefines the word epic which was lost long ago.\n\nThis movie will never be forgotten and stay with me forever.\n\nI give it 10/10.",
        "Action in this movie is incredible. The story is told in full, and very clever. No boring long drawn out sections that you usually expect in a reboot of a movie like this. The casting could not be better. Not one week link. And to our new superman. Amazing. Go and see this movie. It will be a massive hit anyway, but don't miss out. The poor critic reviews are no real surprise. They want more storytelling and more romance and less action. Think they are missing the point of the movie. This is a fantastic story and brought up to date extremely well. The romance will develop in later movies. He has just met her by the way. Go go go go go . And go again. You will miss a classic action movie if you don't.",
        "The movie Man of Steel is an action packed super-hero movie and is better than superman returns. The visuals are just superb esp. the fight between Gn. Zod and the hero. The characterization is too serious I feel. Also not much humor content in the movie but I don't think anyone would want humor in a movie like this. The first hour gives the viewers something like a Nolan's touch with graphic display of the director and I pretty well enjoyed it. I have been watching Super man movies, cartoons and reading comics since the year I was born. This movie contradicts almost everything with what I've seen or read. Like superman getting his people killed while he could've taken the villain to a no man's land, a new meaning to letter S, him trusting a total stranger's words as his father and this list goes on. The worst part is that he sees one of the family member dying in a hurricane and does nothing.",
        "Before general zod, movie was 6. After general zod, 0. Holy crap did the special effects guys go over the top bad making this movie.",
        "Man of steel is Outstanding in every way, one of the best Superman film's ever since Christopher reeves superman. Henry Cavil so bring a performance that's outstanding for the character, giving him a more emotional & character traits that was spot on which really show through out the film,clearly the best actor we've had to play superman as he fits the role perfect. Michael Shannon is just amazing as general Zod he brought this cold ruthless side to the character,as he would stop at nothing to save his people which bring destruction in he's wake.I love the fact they didn't go with the original music as they use the music from Hans Zimmer which really set the mood of the film brilliantly. Along with the amazing Visual effect, special effect, fight scene & the brilliantly done flash back's to Clark's story grow up this film is not to be missed.I give this film a film rating of 10 out of 10 for outstanding performance's by all actors & actress's.",
        "This movie could have been awesome, but some severe mistakes were made that made it a complete disaster.\n\nGreat special effects, a futuristic vision for the man of steel, but a terrible script, embarrassingly weak romance and ridiculous plot holes make this a masterpiece only for earths most mindless inhabitants.\n\nThe movie began with a lot of promise and midway through things weren't looking too bad. Once the big action began though, the script went down hill faster than a speeding bullet.\n\nOverall it feels they are just trying too hard to make Superman new and cool, that it simply comes of as fake and pretentious.",
        "When I watch the original 1978 Superman I get goosebumps, I get emotional, I am hopeful of mankind aspiring to do great things, to make the world a better place. The John Williams music is rousing from the first minute to the last. Richard Donner's Superman is the epitome of superhero flicks because of its warmth and attention to character.\n\nWhen I watched the train wreck Man of Steel I felt nothing except utter disgust for treating the material this way and wanting the film to be over. The music is atrocious (Zimmer has done much better than this). I say avoid this film if you hold the original film in your heart. Snyder completely misunderstood what Superman is about. Man of Steel is also too dependent on CGI effects, so that they become obnoxious after a while.",
        "The camera is extremely close to everything is constantly shaking like an addict. It made me physically nauseous. The rest was so bad our whole family had to get up and leave after about 20 minutes.\n\nI couldn't tell you if the story was any good--my eyes were closed most of the time because it was simply intolerable...and I watch a lot of movies!\n\nMy daughter was plugging her ears because the sound was insanely loud (IMAX 2D), my wife thought 'blah', I was nauseous. Altogether a bad experience.\n\nWhy the shaky camera? It doesn't add value.",
        "I had mixed feelings watching the movie. I liked the revision of the history of Superman and I have enjoyed the special effects and the fast-paced plot. A little less a few choices, such for example the death of an enemy, after exhausting and unbelievable battles with the mere breaking of the neck.\n\nFor what it is, a comic book, the film is fun and well done in the actual standard and gave me two hours of nice entertainment. Perhaps some previous Superman movies, despite the dated special effects involved me more, but at that time I also had another age.\n\nConsidering just the epic soundtracks and the ideas behind the special effects, this movie, although not perfect, in no way can be ranked one star.\n\n7/10",
        "Man of Steel is the story of how Clark Kent, Superman, came to be. It runs at 2 hours and 30 minutes long, and features probably 3 intense action scenes. There are a lot of special effects, but it is obvious that they are special effects and there isn't any \"wow\" factor to this movie for a film made in 2013. The rest of the movie is quite long and drawn out. The back story is of course, crucial, and you know that Marvel is going to make another movie after this. However, I hope that Batman vs. Superman doesn't move as slowly as this movie does. One other thing that disappointed me was that there was hardly any chemistry between Lois Lane and Clark Kent. They do share a kiss and fall in love, but the scene feels so awkward and forced, and during the rest of the movie you'd be content to believe they were just friends and that there was no attraction at all. The one saving grace is that Henry Cavill is gorgeous and he makes for amazing eye candy. But as a superhero movie, it's quite slow and for how long it is, it can be a drag to get though.",
        "I have been waiting for this movie for a long time, and I was in shock of what I saw. The movie is targeted for the mass that is interested only in visual effects and will not notice an absence of proper storyline. I have the feeling that Nolan was not even aware of the creation of the movie, cause there was nothing from him: Nor deepness of the characters,neither any kind of intrigue in the plot. The original story of Superman contains everything that is interesting for nowadays public and is more than enough for a good movie creation and you are probably a mediocrity if you have managed to spoil all these. The worst of all was presented the relationship between the Superman and his EARTH parents, I mean how would the Superman let his father die only to keep his secret uncovered, considering that the main strength (and probably the biggest w\u0435\u0430kness) of the Superman has been always his absolute self-sacrifice, which was not presented in movie at all. In reality I vote \"2\" instead of \"1\" only because of the fillings, hops and expectations I had towards this project before entering the cinema.",
        "Man of Steel was disappointing. Although decent, it fell short of its hype. It boasts a better re-telling of Supermans background, including a superb beginning to the movie. Also there is undeniably amazing effects here with more destruction than you could imagine. However, the action sequences became boring very quickly. Smashing through walls and getting up again was soon dull and disinteresting. This was not aided by a terribly casted villain who's given cheesy lines. Henry Cavill wasn't much better, obviously cast for his good looks, buff body and constant frown. There was a sense of grand scale but never did it feel remotely threatening or tense. In fact, for the most part it was emotionless but for his relationship with his two sets of parents. Man of Steel was a refreshing reboot nonetheless but it definitely wasn't ground breaking.",
        "I walked in my local movie theater to see Man of Steel with my friends the Sunday it came out. Inside, there was a sign for t-shirts with the new alien-like superman symbol on it for twenty dollars. We all thought that was ridiculous. Anyway, we plopped in our seats with our 3D glasses and watched the film. When the action finally started in Smallville, I was like \"This... Is... HAPPENING!!\" The action was obviously more physical than any other movie I've ever seen. The 3D, however, didn't enhance the spectacle of violence galore, and I believe it could've done well without it. When I noticed that the soundtrack wouldn't include the original works from John Williams, I thought to myself, \"Will I miss that?\" NOBODY misses the old music score. The soundtrack is both beautiful and original thanks to Hans Zimmer. When the final credits rolled onto the screen, my friends and I got up from our seats and rolled out of the theater. When I asked them on their first thoughts of the film, one responded, \"I want to buy a t-shirt, it's worth the money.\"",
        "Superman, or Man of Steel, has been made multiple times on the big screen. I liked the fact that the writers came up with an origin for the \"S\". But throughout the Superman history, only 3 characters went to the Phantom Zone. There are over a dozen in this rendition. Where did they all come from if all of the comics only had 3? I had never heard or read where the people of Krypton had sent outposts on other planets. Yet for all of their technology to visit other worlds, they quit? The society of Krypton is portrayed as smart and advanced, yet they have not idea the planet is being destroyed? Again, I like creativity, and making extrapolations where no information has been written but don't take liberties with what we have grown up reading or write in story lines that do not have well-developed logic.",
        "Absolute trash. Just watch the original from the 70s and save yourself this depressive torture tour.",
        "With far too many of the former and not nearly enough of the latter! Amy Adams, Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe are wasted on this disappointing mess of a movie and poor old Henry Cavill is only required to exercise his torso muscles rather than his acting muscles as The Man of Steel. No humour, no warmth and very little romance - just mind numbingly tedious explosion after explosion.\n\nI am very glad I caught this on TV and was able to switch off. Had I paid good money to see this crap in the cinema I would have asked for a refund!",
        "THIS IS \"THE SUPERMAN\" MOVIE and i like it lot no scene i felt bored or i say its enough. Each and every scene was mind blowing, literally my mouth was open till end of the movie. Before going to see the movie i heard many critic had bad review that lot of action, less humor and superman is very serious...lot of craps. I Totally disagree with them all are bunch of fools who expects deep drama, romance etc etc...i thought it was all mixture in some sense and all worked fine. On whole movie is awesome \"PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO CRITICS\" go and watch this movie and you won't be disappointed. For me i expect superman movie should be action packed and it was well deserved. I Will give 10/10...no second thoughts...",
        "Man of Steel's exhilarating action and spectacle can't fully overcome its detours into generic blockbuster territory.",
        "Like most post 2000's era films we have a basic storyline, with too much CGI, explosions to make up for the fact it's a simple storyline. I like the origin story in the beginning, but found they jumped around too much with current and flashback events. Some of the fight scenes became way too over the top. Cavill did a decent job as Superman, but I may have to revisit 1978,1980 to see comparisons. I like character development and growth which I did see from Henry. Costner did a great job as Superman's earth dad.",
        "This movie had so much action that it was so exciting to watch. This movie was a lot better then the old Superman movies to me. It was so intense and had a perfect plot. This is the way a superman movie should be made. I liked how they made krypton look and all the great special effects and graphics. I think they showed a little to much flashbacks and the only problem i had with the movie was the part when Superman healed Lois with his heat vision. It reminded me of Superman 2 on how they made the story and used the villains. This is a must see movie for all DC comic fans. Marvel fans should check this movie out too. Im looking forward to seeing Superman show up in the justice league movie.",
        "Dark knight-8.5/10 Dark knight rises-8.9/10 MAN OF STEAL-8.6/10... You can not stop remembering this movie for a day...its not inspiring but its remarkable... Found mostly every logic behind a scene...powers were explained... Before interval 7 after interval it jumps to 8...out of 10..The character chosen suitably fits in superman title..It would be hard to put all of story into one movie...there was a bit loss of connection in movie...movie missed inspiring lines..motivating story..that was seen in dark knight..This movie can not be compared to any other movie..Its comparison can only done with dark knight...The bad experience of iron man 3 was abolished by superman...Surely one cant be satisfied watching this movie once for sure....",
        "what i love about this superman is that it's a great and child appropriate. Love the acting from Diane Lane and Amy Adams. I really thought Man Of STeel was one of the best movies ever made. I am going to buy it when it comes out on DVD. They should make more movies like Superman Man of Steel. It's amazing. I thought and I hope that Man of Stell wins the best movie of the year. What i love about Man of Steel is that it has Romance, My Favorite Actress ever which is Diane Lane and Amy Adams. My favorite actor Russell Crowe and Kevin Coaster. They should make more movies like Man of Steel. Zack Synder did a perfect job directing Man of Steel and i thought it was and is one of my favorite movies ever made and Deborah Syner did perfedt as well producing the movie",
        "As I am ardent fan of Nolan (though he dint direct the movie) I went to this movie keeping high expectations but I am bit disappointed. I like the first half where you can feel a well maintained balance between Action and Drama. But second half bit over in terms of Action. I felt Lois Lane character could have been a bit better. Hans Zimmers's music is not so great as I felt it over producing. I like Henry Cavill a lot and felt he is perfect fit for Superman role.He acted well upto the mark. Russell Crowe is also good provided the limits of his role. I felt they should have shown few more details on Superman childhood. Over all its a one time watch and I prefer to watch it in 2D compared to 3D.",
        "Tries very hard to build up characters from the beginning of the batman story but none of them are interesting enough to be bothered about. By the time the action starts I'd sort of lost interest in the movie. I think it's the worst of all superman films I've seen and wants to be too serious for the subject matter. It needs a good actor to play superman and some good dialogue, a bit tongue in cheek, is always good. Neither of these were in this film. If a director wants to make a more serious film about superman, like they've attempted with Batman they need stronger actors, a better love interest and a better storyline. Falls into the trap of a lot of movies these days. Too much reliance on special effects to the detriment of storyline.",
        "This was the best Superman movie to date. I cannot remember setting in a movie theater and enjoying a movie from the beginning to end. I only wish it had been a 4 hour movie. I wish it had more time to spend on his home world. I cannot wait until the sequel. Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan craft a much needed reboot of the Superman franchise. How does Man of Steel compare to others in the series? Well, it is a darker, much more serious film that boasts a great cast of talent actors and a great plot. I much prefer this version of Superman, as I find that superhero films should be fun and this file nailed it. This by far the most intense Superman film yet, and Zack Snyder has delivered a terrific picture that is sure to delight fans of the comic. I've always been a bigger Batman fan, but I really loved the original Superman and its subsequent sequel. Man of Steel erases the slate clean and offers a bold new direction in terms of action, thrills and drama. With that being said, I think this is one of the finest superhero films I've seen since",
        "I should note that this review is not based on the full movie as I only managed to watch the first 30min or so before feeling compelled to switch off - it was that bad... Those 30 min, however, were enough to convince me that this movie was on par with recent Hollywood action releases such as the Ironman 2 & 3, Battleship etc, and as such devoid of any interesting plot or characters. In short, a big action mess with little logic behind it (and, yes, I'm aware it's Superman but that doesn't mean that the characters' motives and actions should also defy logic) to an extent that you'd think that Damon Lindelof had a go at the screenplay. Starting to think that Zack Snyder is a one-hit-wonder with his only watchable movie being 300 (and perhaps to a lesser extent Watchmen).",
        "I have seen the superman movies from the 70s and 80s but man of steel is probably the best modern day superman movie.This origin story of superman is amazingly well written because this story shows a different take on the superman origin in a fresh and new way in my opinion. The direction by Zack Snyder who also directed films like 300 and also watchmen did an amazing job directing man of steel because Zack Snyder is familiar with the way a comic book adapted into a film should be directed. The film was very well casted with actors like Henry Cavill and Amy Adams as Lois Lane.With many others like Lawrence Fishburne Diane lane, Kevin Costner,Michael Shannon and Russell Crowe who all make their perspective rolls their own. Overall this movie is,in my opinion,the best movie of the summer.",
        "Compared to what 'Superman Returns' offered in 2006, 'Man of Steel' come back with a stronger power to drawn the audiences attention by having a well-named director and incredible cast with a more interesting story too.. Henry Cavill gave a strong performance as Clark Kent with another lovely performance from Amy Adams as Lois Lane, but the star of this movie is no other than Michael Shannon who successfully as before portraying a ruthless villain in the name of General Zod.. Overall, since I haven't watched the original Superman in 1980's, this version is way better than 'Superman Returns' but just good not that great nor amazing..",
        "I was forced to give this a 1 star....why can't I give it a 0? This movie was worse than the Brian Singer debacle. I don't want to include any spoilers but there were so many things wrong with this movie. So many inconsistencies and absolutely no character development. Apparently \"Superman\" is the new Batman. He is broody, angst ridden, and it never seems very valid. I really liked the summary of the movie on io9 that does contain spoilers about the movie. It was pretty accurate.\n\nJust do a search for 'The most important scenes from Man of Steel' and check out the io9 link. :)",
        "Soooo, I'm seeing a TON of 9 and 10 star reviews and lots of \"MASTERPIECE\" thrown around. Not even close. This movie is essentially Independence Day on steroids with Superman thrown in the mix. That's it. If you love non stop CGI and endless explosions than this movie is definitely for you. Was it bad? No. Was it awesome? Nope. It was okay but would not rewatch. It's at its best when there was no cgi explosions and more of a human connection to the story and main characters but alas it would fall dreadfully short. Instead it focused more on being one big video game with not much to offer in the way of connecting to any of the main characters. Kids will love this but an old timer like me? Gimme Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman Superman movies all day over this. It's worth a watch though.",
        "I would probably be the only person from my gang who liked the movie. The reason being simple. I went in expecting a Superman movie and not a Batman (or for that matter a 300). At the same time, I pity the people who went in to watch it, WITHOUT wanting mind-blowing special effects, Superman's 'Superman' powers, Hans Zimmer's magical music and the Nolan-Snyder effect!. The movie was a tad lengthy though. Snyder presents to us a Superman who had a background - a story which made him make the choices that he made. Hans Zimmer, meanwhile 'not-so- silently' wove his magic in the background. 'Man of Steel' is probably the only movie in which, even the Super-Villain 'General Zod', looks justified for his actions. The man of Steel has finally arrived and he will be called SuperMan!",
        "... otherwise I would have rated it even lower, but not watched it. If you can enjoy something as stupid and senseless as Prometheus, then this is surely for you.\n\nI like Emmerich's stuff, Day after tomorrow, Whitehouse down etc, because Emmerich has a mind and a vision. But this... Ouch...\n\nI don't understand how a cast like this can be so misused. On the other hand, the total lack of sense - or being true to the sources - goes a fair way towards explaining this nonsensical void. It seems to me that movies based on comics peaked with Burton's Batman movies. Spiderman was OK, but after that? Where did the humor go? Why make movies like this one? I don't know.",
        "It's truly amazing how there can be so little character development in a 2-hour+ movie while filling the screen with endless CGI that looks so fake it's like watching a long video game!\n\nCavill looks the part but lacks the charisma or gravitas required to embody such an iconic character. Are we meant to believe that he and Lois could fall in love despite spending almost no time together in the course of the movie?\n\nThe one good part was the villains plan, something truly different from what we've seen before.\n\nUltimately a waste of a beloved character.",
        "We could had have more, but cuz of you and your criticism we didn't. Perfect movie, perfect music, perfect effects, I will never get tired of watching this movie. Faora rules, her fighting is the best. Definitely in mi top 5 superheroes movies. Way better than any from Marvel.",
        "before going for the movie.i happened to look at critic reviews.felt a bit skeptical. but after watching the movie,let me tell you. none of you or me will never agree with a bad review for this movie. absolutely fantastic effort..snider and team.perfect casting.awesome story line.flawless direction.visually stunning. don't wanna comment on predictability. come-on every body knows every thing about superman,what ever story they come up with,how ever good it is .it will seem predictable for many of us.so that's that. please do not expect another dark knight out of this movie.it is not.and it should not be. overall this movie gave superman a legendary break on the movie screen.lets hope this is the start of many awesome superman movies. i cant rate this any thing less than a 10/10.",
        "I wanted to like Man of Steel but I almost left about 2 hours into the movie. Some tasty stuff: some very innovative special effects on Krypton, artistic, new, compelling. The Bad: mind numbing action sequences that were frankly repetitive. Many many of these could have been deleted with no effect on the story. Potential character arcs frequently left undeveloped with the exception of Clark's relationship to his mother/father. Relationship to the villain, to his Krypton father, to Lois Lane, to Perry White all undeveloped. My most prominent memory of this film is the characters standing still and staring up into the sky as scenes of massive destruction played out 50 different ways. Then I watched the credits: multiple Executive Producers all with their own title frames. Too many leaders/cooks in a film's financing and development can leave the food tasteless. This bird is way overcooked.",
        "With the second major progression of superhero movies, it just keeps getting better and better. Ultimately, the CGI elements are what make these kind of movies possible, or else it's back to the dark ages of film. This version of Superman will not disappoint. The fact the Goyer and Nolan are a part of the screenplay says everything. They know their comic book history. Remember how detailed The Dark Knight trilogy was in contrast to the origin stories?? The writing style of Nolan's is present, but not as predominant as it was in Batman Begins. Even though some of the concepts were tweaked, it is a great storyline that was over-due for Superman. For those who remember the version with Christopher Reeve, the storyline helps explain the introductory scene of the original '77 version much better, and even though the black Spandex from the Superman II villains doesn't come right away, it does not disappoint. The action doesn't slow down and for a traditional two hour and twenty time frame, it takes up every minute of the film.",
        "A movie I could watch several times a day without getting bored.",
        "If you expect a \"remake\" of superman with actual changes, then go read a fan-comic! I too, was naive and expected a deeply confused, misanthropic outcast of a hero with actual depth, but I do not anymore!\n\nLet's forget all those great things a movie can have, like substance, a logical plot, anything related to reality or anything even remotely interesting - action made from people that have never studied physics is here to save the day!\n\nWhich character was the least believable to you? The father? The mother? The girlfriend? Or just Clark Kent?\n\nAt least there were evil believers in 'evolution' and a church in the movie, so I guess we can extrapolate which American Political party gets represented!",
        "They basically rebranded war of the worlds/ Independence Day as well as totally used a scene from Thor. Amy Adams and Michael Shannon are great actors but casting misses for this movie in those roles. You take Superman completely out of this movie and you just have literally every other alien invasion movie. The Superman parts are so minimal to the story. Sad this is what they envisioned as a Superman movie. Supergeneric is the only super thing about it.",
        "I am a huge fan of Superman, and watching this movie made me love him even more, I think this movie does the character justice and at the same time grounded him in reality in a tasteful way. The visuals and action scenes are the best I have ever seen, even more so that the Avengers which was surprising. It seems that most of the critics are judging way too harshly, I think Clark Kent's character was explored appropriately and was a balanced movie in general. It is a must see movie for all audiences, especially if your a comic book fan and even more so if you like superman as much as I do, personally this has the potential to be one of the best movies of the summer and possibly of the year. Finally Hans Zimmers score was just as Powerful as Superman himself.",
        "The more I watch this movie, the more I love it. You cannot compare this movie to the Reeve's version of the character. Snyder has taken a more modern approach to the character, highlighting Clark Kent's insecurities and confusion about who he is and what kind of person he can be in this world. More of a \"Superman Begins\" approach.",
        "man of steel is the greatest action movie of 2013 in my opinion i think its also the biggest action movie of the decade its has better action sequence's than any other superhero movie it has much greater action than avengers if your a fan of Zack Snider you will love this movie screw the critics they don't know what they are talking about this is a movie for all the fans who like superhero movie and for those who don't like superman they will also love dis movie so don't miss this movie this is a movie worth watching after leaving the theater you you will not be disappointed and the best thing about man of steel is the superman this is the best superman yet so thumbs up to the best superhero movie yet.",
        "I made the mistake of reading the critics' reviews. They were so wrong! I LOVED this movie! It was EPIC! I absolutely loved it!!! The ending felt right out of a comic book. It was spectacular! This is a Superman for our generation! I'm tired of all the comparisons from past Superman's. This was spot on. I grew up watching the black & white episodes on TV of Superman and I absolutely LOVED this movie!!! Henry Cavill was SUPERB, he embodied all the goodness & rightness of Superman and he was so true to the character. Russell Crowe as Jor El was fantastic!! The entire cast was Great! Loved Amy Adams as Lois Lane, reminded me of how strong & determined we women can be when we believe in something. Go see this movie, it is truly CAPTIVATING!!!!",
        "The story, despite its rich scenarios and satisfactory contents, was well put into one movie (in both successful and impressive ways). It is done by one of the great movie makers of our time - Christopher Nolan - who also participated in the producing. (No surprise there I guess)\n\nThe planetary engineering idea, of the world engine that terraforms and modifies earth's atmosphere and topography, was awesome. No say to its creativity and impact.\n\nThe casts were great as well. In particular, the general Zod by Michael Shannon was the most memorable.\n\nAlthough the work on the music hasn't catch my attention. The stakes are always high when it comes to Hans Zimmer.",
        "Hands down the worst movie of 2013. Boring, tedious, and unoriginal with plot holes throughout and scenes literally ripping off just about every other blockbuster movie you can think of from Independence Day to Transformers while it's supposed to be a Superman movie. Christopher Nolan, David Goyer, and Zack Snyder tarnished the character of Superman with this rubbish and as for chemistry between Lois Lane and Superman, none whatsoever. I couldn't understand what Adam Adams was doing in this movie. Nothing against her but she is not Lois Lane in the slightest. Henry Cavill had potential but fell short although with a director like Zack Snyder and horrible script from David Goyer it's hard to tell what he could have been in the role. And I won't even get into how completely weird the Superman costume looks. There has to be red of some kind going across the mid section. It's pretty basic color coordination and they couldn't even get that right. Downright pitiful.",
        "Like I said in the headline the acting is good. They did well with the casting. The production value is good. Also Zack Snyder is a good director in terms of camera angles and other areas of the production. The story was incredibly boring. The first 15 to 20 minutes was very interesting but after they switched to Earth they got very boring until the last 20 minutes.",
        "Lots and lots and LOTS of special effects. They should have titled this movie \"Special Effects with a Little Bit of Superman thrown in for No Particular Reason.\" Plot? Is it a spoiler to say there were no surprises? Except the sheer volume of special effects? Decent acting. And most of what you thought you knew about Superman and associated characters - well, let's just say - Special Effects. Did I mention there were lots of special effects? If you have nothing better to do - you might want to watch these special effects.\n\nI liked the dogs.",
        "Finally a real superman, forget about clich\u00e9 thing of superman, hiding his identity with only his glasses on, single curly hair on his forehead, tearing his shirt off, flyin arround like a bird with his stupid underwear. The best fighting scene in a history of superhero movie, it was stunned me to my seat with my open wided mouth, when you're using a word super, thats what you should do, hardcore smashing and jet packed flying.. Amy adams never looked so enchanting and smart before, shes quite good for the smart and strong lois lane role here, and also the perfect cast for a superman, not a good sweetie boy who loved to smile with his red underwear. The stories for the origin of superman, was really smart, mixing the comical and science thing, it's just complete. Overall man of steel is Superb!",
        "first time doing this, but the guy who doesn't like superman was too focused on the costume, the story is amazing, realistic in it's entire, i was waiting for a great superman movie because the mind is a powerful thing, the other ones are old or just sucked so bad and could not express the amazing feeling, i watched this for the first time on blu-ray and it just raised the hairs on my body, you need to learn how to be human first, i eventually watched it about 5 times through out the week, and the last 30 minutes just wrapped it up in a perfect bow, i love this movie because i am an outcast and movies like this deserve a 100 out of 10, i'm 23 and i listen to hardcore hip-hop, but this.., if you don't like it go watch The Lost Boys, what a horrible move. PS go to youtube and type in Amazing footage and then click on the video on that has Chi in the title",
        "If u haven't seen it I highly recommend people to see this. I say its the best one i have seen. Henry Cavil totally is the best superman ever. I cant wait to see the sequel. I thought at first Amy Adams wouldn't find out who he was till the 3rd one but she did. It was totally different then the other ones. I did like the director and how he did it. I can totally see another one. I thought Russell Cr owe did a great job playing superman's father. I loved Lawrence Fish burg in it. I give it 4 stars. I now want to see it one more time to see it in 3D. I loved the whole movie.I loved seeing scenes that looked like NYC. I loved seeing all the planets and the sky what it looked like.",
        "Granted I am a fan of the comic book heroes. This movie took the title and the character names and that was about it. It appeared as if Hollywood had a lot of explosion footage to use it, so let's not even try to put together a coherent story, just use the explosions as much as possible. There were so many plot and character discrepancies; i.e. took Kal El years to adjust to earth but the other characters adjusted in minutes,etc. So many flaws in this movie... And, yes, I wanted a good reboot of this series. This made the first Hulk and even the Catwoman movie look good. In fact, I preferred the really silly Superman 3 (or was it 4) that had Richard Pryor to this mess.",
        "With the beginning itself the movie is engrossing. The Krypton is a visual delight. Screenplay by David S. Goyer is fantastic & direction by Zack Snyder is superb. Background Score by Hans Zimmer is fantastic & perfectly blends with the scenes. Kevin Costner & Diane Lane proved to be good parents to Cavill as Jonathan & Martha Kent.The 3-D effects were nice and CGI were fantastic.A wonderful scripted movie beautifully executed by great actors. A hugely impressive and entertaining story of arguably the most powerful character in the superhero pantheon (and also one of the biggest pop culture icons), it's clear that the Man of Steel is here to stay.",
        "This is my first review on IMDb and have chosen this brilliant movie for the same.I have grown up reading superman comics and watching superman movies. I had been a die hard superman fan since my childhood days. After watching Zack Synder's Man of Steel, I can say that this the superman of my imagination.\n\nThe visuals were breathtakingly amazing! Henry Cavill is the superman after Christopher Reeve. He successfully made me to erase previous superman memories. The battle between Superman and Gen. Zod is epic! It is much more better and grand than Avengers. The back ground score by Hans Zimmer is perfect. The cast of the movie is excellent. Russell Crowe was too good. So were Kevin Costner and Diane Lane. Michael Shannon as Zod was terrific. Better watch the movie in 2-D.\n\nMy rating is 9/10.",
        "The acting was below par. Mr. Crow's B- performance barely was able to balance the equation to Michael Shannon's D+ performance. The action of the movie is not matched by the poor display of character portraying.\n\nFor the person who does not know the story of Superman, the background was given poor explanation. This beginning movie needs a movie to explain it.\n\nHenry Cavill (Superman) by himself made the movie tolerable; however, there was no coherency between the actors. No bond could be seen between Martha Kent (Superman's earthly mom played be Diane Lane) and her alien son, Superman. Henery Cavil (Superman) showed emotional attachment to his earth mother well; but this bond was unequally returned with believilbility by actress Diane Lane.",
        "I think i went in with too many expectations with Nolan and Zimmer being on the team.. I figured.... how bad can the movie be eh?\n\nDon't get me wrong.. this movie is still probably the best Superman movie ever... It's better than most of the new superhero movies lately (dark knight movies aside though..) but the script disappoints you so much with the lack of focus, shoddy dialogue.\n\nThe action is excellent, the cgi is mind blowing and the background score saves some honor of the film. However if you go expecting a movie of the-dark-knight level of depth and attention to detail, you WILL be disappointed!",
        "Yes, this is the best and worst Superman movie. If you don't know Superman essence, this is the movie, great action, fx and an excellent movie, however, when I saw the movie for the first time, I was in shock, Superman is an assassin. Yes, simply as that. Maybe the concept is different and the writers and producers wanted to show a new Superman, where he needs to learn in the process and \"learn how to trust in human nature\". I don't know, but really this disturbed me. I am a fan of superman since I was a kid, and everybody knows that Superman is Superman, and he doesn't kill or let somebody to die, but here the concept is different, reason of my 7 stars. The movie is amazing, Henry Cavill is excellent as Superman. I want to see more coming and maybe in the others, Superman will mold according to the \"real concept\".",
        "As a fan all my life, I was highly anticipating this film from the start. Superman is certainly a polarizing figure in his own right and within the last 30 odd years we have encapsulated him and have been confused as to what we do with him. The 78 Donner film, seems to have encased this mythos to a point the character has been stuck in a time lapse. Zack Snyder's re imagining is the beginning of making large cracks in the glass that surrounds him. This film is ballsy. It's large and an epic in every sense of the word. It is humorless and quite heavy, to agree with the criticism. But it's also the most emotional and spiritual of the mythos thus far. Not a perfect film, as it does plod along on large plot exposition in the 3rd act. The fight scenes become comparable to a Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck fight with no real emotional investment, but Snyder plays with us to reveal that these fights serve a purpose for a finality to a Superman battle that might again create some controversy. I for applaud it and applaud Snyder for making a larger stand on what it really means for Superman to be the world's savior and moral compass. It comes at a cost and reduces Clark to understand the power of being human. Isn't that really what a Superman is?",
        "Boring and predictable - just a re-hash of a story told hundreds of times already.",
        "Went to the cinema to see the new Man Of Steel today.. With high expectations after reading reviews and watching the trailers.\n\nThis movie did not reach my expectations. Yes it had some amazing effects, a quite good storyline and a lot of action.. But it all was just to much!! It feels like the producers just piled one explosion onto the other one just because they could.. Lots of action and lots of fights. But if you're looking for a flick where you actually need to use you brain, this is not it.\n\nI give Man Of Steel 6 out of 10, because even though it might have its flaws and lack of charm. Its very well made, and in many ways overwhelming.. But the producers could have turned it down a notch on the explosion/action and concentrated on building some more suspense.",
        "This is an amazing step in the most exciting direction a Superman movie could ever go. I saw the Christopher Reeve version. I liked it. I didn't love it. But this new twist is extraordinary. Henry Cavill is perfect in the role. I love Kevin Costner in anything and I only wish he had more screen scenes with Henry. Amy Adams was good too. I think I would have cast Kerry Russell as Lois, but AA was good. The important fact is this wasn't the same old rehash of something already done. It was fresh and new. I would have liked to have seen a baby Clark maybe bending the bars of his crib or hoisting a coffee table over his head. I wish there was a little less battle and more interaction with the Kents. Perhaps in the sequel more scenes that were cut out with the Kents can be added. We can only hope so. Otherwise, I was very pleased and in awe of the entire thing. Very well done!",
        "This movie version defies the story. So honky. They could have easily modified and made a Twilight Zone movie. If you watch it, you will never watch it again. And they are considering a sequel - Man of Steel 2 !!! Amy Adams and Diane Lane plays great parts, Adams as Lois Lane the very investigative reporter. Lawrence Fishburne as Perry White is stiff and shows no personality. The movie was made for the action. Definitely not for the story. Clark Kent does not keep his superman powers hidden. He tells everyone he has special powers, especially to Lois Lane. Not much of a story. Action filled but empty story. How bad could the sequel be. I guess by the reviews some have enjoyed the movie or the hype. Save your money and go see a real movie.",
        "Im typing this as the credits roll (was at the Walmart premier). I have seen the RT reviews and I know there are plenty of people that want to see the film fail. In the end this film delivers on the only front it intends to which is: entertainment. Seriously, the movie drew me in. I wanted to know more about our hero. The flashbacks weren't distracting, rather they left me wanting more. There is PLENTY of action. Too much? You're the judge because you're the one paying to see it. I thought it for the scope of the battle which was basically two gods fighting to the death. I will leave this theater with my expectations met. However the credits are still rolling (im waiting to see if they show anything about the new movie).",
        "I have been to some amazing films by Christopher Nolan. This was not one of them. For me it was a huge let down.\n\nMy main complaint is that it didn't MOVE me! When two characters are having some super boxing match, I didn't feel any empathy, they didn't appear to even get hurt, and I didn't even CARE who won. The only way you can tell which are the bad guys and which are good is by what color costume they are wearing. But all of them seemed like a lot of stupid jocks.\n\nThe Dark Knight series was inspired. Man of Steel was total clich\u00e9... save the planet... not one original idea in the whole film. not one. Not even a twist. Hmmm. Boring. Nolan, you should be embarrassed. I want my money back.",
        "So far, Rotten Tomatoes with all of its \"Acclaimed Critics\" is wrong. This is a very very good movie. It deserves way better than a 57% (which is where it currently stands on that site). The user reviews on the site still show that the average movie goer rated it basically the same as on IMDb. Go see this movie. It is by far the best Superman film there is. The prude critics can just wallow in their negativity for all I care.\n\nThe plot was excellent. The origin story was small, which is great. Everyone already knows the back story. We don't need to see it done again and again and again and... The villain earns respect from the very first scene. All of the actors did a spectacular job. The costumes were top notch. The only thing negative I have to say is that the action was happening so fast at some points, you couldn't be sure what you were looking at. Some scenes were zoomed in to the action so close, it was just a blur on the screen. But that's my only complaint. Worth seeing, worth buying. Do it.",
        "its like the matrix part 3 but much much worse no story no acting , Nada. its a movie with 200 million budget you would expect to see more invest in writing more invest in actors, maybe the only actor worth something is the one playing superman, but he alone cant lift this movie up. in the first superman movie 1978,there was Christoffer reeve who was perfect for this part but you also had Gene heckman and others so they make the movie a bit funny this movie is Grey literally, no color and always on the dark it reminds me the dark knight part 3 which is also awful had no story.... this movie is full with effects that most of them don't look real,it looks like an computer animation....",
        "I watched this movie in imax 3D and this movie does not seem to have any 3D effects. At least you would expect feeling of superman flying into you or maybe 3D technology is not advanced as I thought it would be. Maybe it's just a crappy 3D movie.\n\nI found the plot really weak. They could have complicated or shown more hardship of superman being accepted by humans. The last 30 minute of the fight in the movie was very boring to watch. It seems like every comic movies adapting to this epic battle where all the buildings falls and makes it like its going to be end of the world but we all know its going to be saved by the hero.\n\nI just hate paying to watch a movie that has no well developed story , no actual 3D effects and made up full random scenes put together.",
        "Same old story but recreating it with sheer confidence; that's what amazed me. Another thing that stood out for me was background score. These movies are worth watching in theaters and I am glad, I did that. Though, I am not sure why every other movie is 3D these days. Perhaps, could be for earning more bucks. The movie is excellent in totality. Not only, did the characterization build-up of Superman was good but also the action scenes were awesome. I would still rate Batman Begins much better but then, it had an advantage of a new kind of story-telling. Expectations are obvious to grow after Batman trilogy but this movie steals the show in its own way. Man of steel is here to stay and it will definitely have its own fan following, those who will eagerly await for the sequels to come. However, this may not look good on TV sets as I felt that a major part of the movie is shot in dark . But, a must watch in theater.",
        "Just watched Superman in IMax 3D!!! Cool part: Loved the fight sequences with superman regularly breaking the sound barrier!! And superman \"Super-Spear\"ing his opponents at regular intervals... Henry Cavill fits nicely as superman. Not so cool part: Was disappointed with Lois Lane ..her character was not believable AT ALL!!! What didn't work for me is she somehow ending up in the middle of all the action ,superman falling in love with her ...without any good explanation. I never felt emotional for any of the characters and didn't really understand superman's resolve to save the human race!! (Actually I didn't care if earth was destroyed since i really hadn't related to any of the characters in the movie.) Most parts of the movie went fast without much explanation with a lot of gaping holes in the plot... So only for the visual effects and the action sequences i give this movie a 5/10.",
        "The movie we all have been waiting for. It's just incredible and much better when you see it twice. Amazing action, spectacular visual effects, tremendous acting, powerful soundtrack and well composed story. I must say that Antje Traue was one of my favourite and Henry Cavill is, by far, the best Superman after Christopher Reeve. The soundtrack is extraordinary and beautiful, Hans Zimmer never disappoints his fans. I must say that Superman was never my favourite superhero, but after seeing this masterpiece, I completely changed my opinion. This movie teach us so much and it is just amazing. Zack Snyder did a great job and I HOPE the sequel reaches levels never seen before. 10/10",
        "My first review ever!\n\nWhile 99.9% of Hollywood movies are made for -20 IQ public this one just tops them all.\n\nAs usual utterly senseless, pointless, violent and completely dumb 143 minutes of stupidity perfectly suitable for average American film-goers!\n\nBut if you are not American, do yourself a favor and save some precious minutes of your life! I regretted this waste of my life so much that decided to write my first-ever review ONLY to warn other decent folks with a functioning brain.\n\nAnd for crying out loud, when the hell you Americans are going to grow up and get over this super-this super-that complex? It shows nothing but your inferiority complex!",
        "Where was Clark Kent, reporter. Mr. Kent was not killed in a tornado. Superman's costume did not just appear, it was originally sewn by Mrs. Kent from cloth that was in the space ship that brought Kal El to Earth and it did not look like it was made from lizard skin. This movie would make Jerry Siegal and Joe Shuster vomit. There is not a thing in this movie that even resembles the original storyline. Okay, I'm an old guy. I was born 16 months after Superman was born at DC Comics. As a kid, I read most of the comics of that era. I also watched the poorly made serials from the 1940s. At least those serials followed the original storyline, as written by the authors. This piece of junk was just fodder for egotistical screenwriters who have no concept about comics or the original idea behind them. What a total piece of GARBAGE.",
        "First of all i am not a fan of any comic character..i am a big fan of Hollywood from India.I waited long for man of steel because it contain Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder names in it.\n\nI am truly disappointed when i am watching the movie.It contains no scene where it got my attention.there was too much destruction in this movie and the concept of destroying the earth was seen in wide range of other Hollywood movies.i feel nothing new in it.\n\nThe positive side of man of steel is performances and some CGI.i know superhero movies doesn't contain too much love or romance but in this movie there are almost negligible.The movie just slides up suddenly after one hour and there starts deja vu.on whole,if you are a fan of superman nd some action go for it..",
        "You take 2 teaspoon of \"Matrix: Revolutions\", 1 and 1/2 of \"Independence Day\", 1 of \"The Avengers\", 1 of \"The Matrix\", 1/2 of \"Transformers\", 1/2 of \"2012\". In a large bowl (a.k.a. DC Comics Universe), mix together the cake mix, season it with a bit of \"The Hulk\", ad a flavour of \"Riddick\" and sprinkle a bit of \"2010 - Space Odyssey\", just a bit (the satellite dishes scene). Butter it with a cheap scriptwriting (as if it were a story for 6-9 yrs. old), bake it while using a decent soundtrack and ornate it with a good cast (Matrix, West Wing, plus, you have: Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne). There you go: \"Man of Steel\", a movie that is not extraordinary at all. Enjoyable, though, should you spend an evening, however not pretentiously relaxing.",
        "Really enjoyed it, was a dark and realistic which some people didnt like but I thought was a good chance from all the other comic book movies out there.",
        "My first review ever. I have watched every comic book movie and comic book TV-series that has ever been released and although some movies have greatly impressed me like \"The Dark Knight\" and \"Marvel's The Avengers\", I must admit that the Man of Steel raises the bar higher. The special effects, the acting, and the plot/story were exceptional. Man of Steel should definitely be in IMDb's top 250. I hope that all future comic book movies are half as good in story, special effects, and acting. All comic book fans should enjoy this movie and no doubt that it will impress. Looking forward to the sequels and to future releases of comic book movies especially by \"Nolan\".",
        "This movie totally redefined superman; perfect way to kick start things for the kryptonian. Shows his struggle as a young lad to fit in the world and the ability to master his power with tolerance. Zack Snyder nailed it and perfect cast selection.",
        "Giving this masterpiece any less than 10 on 10 would be unjustified. Zack Snyder, the director, has brought out to the viewers some of the most magnificent films of Hollywood in the recent years. So is this one. You probably haven't seen a Superhero movie like this. The screenplay and the musical background, keeps you tight and involved all throughout. The villain, General Zod and Co., at some times seem domineering over Superman, but in the end, he unleashes all his powers and defeats Zod. This particular work of Snyder has, perhaps, the most devastating disastrous, epic scenes. Buildings collapsing, Earth becoming weak, but Superman seems to come from nowhere to protect Humanity. Despite a few glitches, the movie made a little over 110 million dollars on the opening day. And I think that's quite enough to describe the craze for the Man Of Steel. Watching it in 3D cinema is certainly a magical experience. But if you've missed it somehow, do not miss the Full HD,i.e., 1080p version. A true Superhero fan's blender choice!",
        "The final hour of the film is more of the same action, all over again. I counted the minutes for it to end. There was hardly no story or dialogues.",
        "This film just did not revive Superman at all...despite the hype. It had all the other elements there but did not enthral me and watched it through to the end out of obligation more than anything. The pacing was off but I did enjoy the music, cinematography and the villain was compelling when he was on screen.",
        "Superman was definitely due for a remake. I have to say that I was not a big fan of movie remakes until I saw \"Batman Begins\". Batman Begins was very well done. Man of Steel however was not the best remake and could have been done much better. Too much CGI and poor casting. The young people who are impressed with this movie have undoubtedly grown up with CGI and missed a better age of movies where the movies were performed instead of computer generated. The original is a classic because as absurd as \"Superman\" is, the actors (who were dramatic stage/theater actors) performed every line. George Lucas (who later contradicted himself) said back in the 1980s while making the original Star Wars movie that a special effect without a story is just a special effect. That's what this movie was, just a series of special effects. Superman is such a fantastic character (unbelievable) that the special effects possible now could really make for a good movie as long as they are not overdone.",
        "Check this film out for some cool CGI and an awesome soundtrack. Beyond that, the writing and plot will fail you.",
        "I'm a big fan of the Christopher Reeve's Superman movies. However, this film is a masterpiece. The visuals, the music, the story make a great Superman movie. I really hope WB realizes its potential and start working on a sequel soon. It does not have to emulate Marvel's style of story telling. The characters from DC have enough material to make great stories. MOS is a clear example.",
        "It wasn't terrible but I'm finding a lot of the newer superhero films just haven't done justice to the originals. The score and CGI were the main appeals. The pacing was slow and the villain was not compelling.",
        "I can't imagine the people who fought this film where the hell are you coming from , this is the third time I see this movie and still I like every single moment of it I think zack is the most dedicated director I've ever seen to his work and he is the master of cinematography every single scene is a painting I like the music too that I really missed in justice league the acting really I can't imagine anyone else except cavil as superman and Russell crowe did one of his best role as jor el this movie will be a reference in a couple of decades for anyone who will study cinema it will be consider a cinema classics",
        "This movie has the action if that is what you are looking for, but the story line is jumpy, all the good feels of the original are not here and honestly, it's a little boring. The chemistry between Amy Adams and Henry Cavill is weak. Sorry, but it is not good.",
        "The movie is alright it's just on the edge of being great it just misses in a few areas.",
        "This movie is so disappointing it doesn't even deserve the 2/10 i gave it.The 2 was for the Henry Cavill shirtless scenes in the first half of the movie, because let's face it, he is hot! It's painful to admit just how bad it is because i am such a hard core Chris Nolan fan, if anything i expected the plot to be good, but it isn't. The plot is unappealing, the acting is horrible, the lines are cheesy, it's very unoriginal. Not one of Nolan's best, he should try to make us forget that he is even involved in this project. Just terrible! Henry Cavill is a waste of hotness, his acting is terrible, so is Rusell crow (I don't understand how he still gets cast in big blockbusters) and the guy who plays general Zod is rubbish",
        "I really struggled with this movie, for the first 1 hour 15 minutes it felt like the scenes were just being forced together, they had no flow to them and as a result I felt the story suffered. The story jumps from young Superman to adult at the click of a finger but failed to capture me at all. The character was not developed enough for me. I was disappointed as I had been waiting for this movie for ages. The action is as you would expect and did not let down but I felt even then the plot let me down.\n\nStill worth watching to form your own view but sadly let down by this movie.",
        "Despite loving it the first time, I expected to hate it like many others do but ultimately, I enjoyed the ideas and creative story it told. The acting was perfect for the roles. That said, this movie isn't average because of what's told, but how it's told. Many scenes feel or of place and have a good idea but could've been done better. The biggest issue I have is with how it looks. The abundant effects get obnoxious and the constant gray look is incredibly boring. There is no color contrast. In one scene, there's an iconic fly in the sun shot but the sun and Superman are so muted there's no triumph feeling. Ultimately, there are enough great moments that I can't hate it.",
        "I need to say that I have been waiting to see the movie for ages, I loved superman 1 2 an even thought 3 was watchable. I expected this film to be darker than the originals. I enjoy both new and old Spider-Man's I can enjoy them for different reasons so I'm not moaning that this film lacks humour. What this film lacks is heart and story line. I just don't get how people can really enjoy this film? I was bored half way through. What I love in the first film Is that we had Clark Kent who was one man and superman who was another we had two characters in one man. This wasn't the case here! Just a lost tortured soul. Some parts were good but most were not. I'm sure once the average joe watches this film and reviews this film we will get a fair average review. Die hard fans will stick up for their hero matter what! Ps you will not care about 1 single character is this film! You have been warned. One thing this will do is see a huge rise in people buying the original super mans so thats one good thing to come Out of it.",
        "Pros ... loved the chemistry between the two leading characters (Lois & Clark). Loved the use of flashbacks in telling Clark's story. Loved the special affects.\n\nCons ... numerous weak story issues: Jor-El had no sense of urgency while preparing to launch his son to Earth; Jor-El didn't bother to ensure Zod was no longer a threat; Zod's prison seemed more like an expensive refuge from a dying planet, and his subsequent escape from it was completely glossed over; Lois' (mountain) climbing on the ice face wasn't credible; why would Lois position herself between Clark's space ship and the ramp at the back of the cargo plane, out of which the ship was about to be dropped? Most of all the crowd scenes -- when Metropolis was under attack -- were on par with junior high school maturity level in every aspect of their production.",
        "At first I didn't even cared about watching this movie. I thought Super Man was a very happy kid in his childhood with all his super powers. But this movie has dug deeper into his feelings and the director was very successful to portrait them in a classy way. The struggle of Super Man to find what he has to become is very well presented in this movie unlike the previous cartoons/movies. The movie doesn't concentrate on showing off his powers (what most of us expect to see) rather it focuses on his origin, his emotions and his feelings. This movie is mush informative on Super Man's background than any other.There is no need to talk about the visual effects as all the movies of this category are very good at it. I bet the director had done a lot of home work for this master piece.",
        "What a joke these critics are. Both the Metascore (popular critics) and rotten tomatoes gave Superman Returns a better rating the Man of Steel. There is no comparison between the two (Man of Steel being far superior).\n\nHenry Cavill plays the role he was born to play. Amy Adams also plays a great Lois Lane. Keep in mind this movie is setting up more Man of Steels to come. There was a lot of explanation of Krypton and his birth parents in the movie that will not be needed in following sequels.\n\nIMO this is a must see film and a start of an amazing series of movies. Can't wait for the next one to come out!",
        "Yes, this is the Superman movie we all had been waiting for. This is not the best work of Zack Snyder, Nolan, Hans Zimmer or David Goyer. But this is the ultimate work of a perfect team. Yes, this movie can take you to new heights. A perfect treat for the comic nerds and movie fanatics all at once.\n\nI enjoyed the movie, every single aspect of it. Every actors have done their part beautifully, and I must admit, the movie elevated me to new levels. The best part of the story is the way it has been told. It makes us feel the Superman is more a person around us, than who just a character. Yes, this is a must watch for humans and aliens all at once.\n\nTechnical aspects have been great, all because they have worked together by all means. This is also a perfect sci-fi movie, unlike any other movies you have experienced before. A must watch!",
        "This is a good Superman movie, but not the best. A lot of people didn't like the collateral damage, but you fight your opponent where they are. If they don't follow you out into the empty desert, you are forced to fight in the city. I liked the villain, and the fight scenes were epic.",
        "This is quite a contrasting film to the 1978 classic starring Christopher Reeve. On the plus side, it tries for something slightly different, seemingly taking itself quite seriously. The humour of the leading characters just isn't there, but that could be because of the dialogue or lack of it. Henry Cavill is bit wooden as Clark Kent and Superman, though his physique is chiseled to the maximum, looking more like a drugged fuelled bodybuilder than any Superman we can recall. On a large scale the special effects are impressive, but lack the imaginative set designs of earlier films. This film seems to drag on during its 2 and half hour run, whereas you can get so caught up in the 78 classic, that time just seemed irrelevant until the thrilling conclusion.",
        "The storyline is so confused and without originality. There is no soul in this, just a mess of CGI and noise. Disjointed action with no relevance. Worse still is the voice track on blu Ray makes the dialogue so hard to hear, but the sf tracks so loud. Nothing more than a total mess. Shame on you.",
        "It's fine , not so thrilling and entertaining but you'll enjoy, if u love henry otherwise I will suggest you to ignore this movie. I heard(positive) a lot about this adaptation of superman then I decided to watch it but it disappointed me, although I liked some of Henry's scenes but apart from that I didn't liked it at all, visuals are great of course, it's a Snyder film .\n\nIf you're a huge superman and Henry's fan, don't watch it for action and fun .",
        "I am a huge fan of superman and... This movie is just to spend time. It won't remain in our memory. It's just about the special effects + science fiction. It is called Man of Steel. But could be anything else. I am sure the American market will like it. And some European. This is not a film for superman fans. It's a film for people who didn't know the real story of superman. General Zod character is bad and I miss Terence Stamp...he was a real villain, not this guy. In the end Clark Kent appears (telling us that there will be a sequel) in the daily planet but...if you look at him...it's superman! Please tell me the character of Clark Kent won't be like it... I hope the director had seen what Christopher Reeve did with Clark Kent...",
        "This film although one of the better Superman films still doesn't match up to other superhero films out. It spends far too long on fight scenes doing the same moves/smashing techniques over and over. It also falls into the annoying many endings category which is plaguing modern cinema at the moment.\n\nThe upsides are the cast are really good which what they had, the acting is not over the top. Russell Crowe plays his usual brooding self but it works with the character.\n\nIn summery, it not only won't be a repeat view but I won't be adding it to my home collection either.",
        "I wish I had another opinion for such a great hero of everyone, yet it falls worse than crap. I support my opinion in one aspect that for me really worth it: the script. I don't know if all the money goes to the special effects, but this epitome of merchandising put boring and predictable dialogs in a 2 hour pack, mixed with a lot of stupid quotes, plus a horrible actuation of the man of steel, who might be a great character for a model campaign, but has no charisma at all.\n\nOf course there is no turn of the screw nor a moment that would make get into the \"intelligent argument\". I tell you, back in the '80, the movies of Christopher Reeve with less budget were much better. Bottom line, if you think this masterpiece of boredom is somehow a little as good as Batman of Nolan, please save your money.",
        "If you are down in dumps then this movie can really cheer you up. I mean the action is immense, the sound is awesome, music has been composed by Hans Zimmer so it is without doubt, simply the best. Please stop listening to what the critics have to say, i mean they liked a movie like king speech over Inception. So they are without brains really. As for the story, well its a fantasy so don't expect any common sense. But damn i had such a great time watching it, especially because it was in 3D. Other than that, its the best movie so far to come out in 2013, fast 6 was just for money making, and iron man 3 was like watching a french movie without subtitles, i mean i never understood what was going on, so i would say that you won't wanna miss this movie.",
        "I had wanted to see this movie for such a long time and when it finally came out, I was NOT disappointed. Sure, there are a few stupid parts in the movie, like, a couple lines in the beginning of the movie were so cheesy that they were laughable, and the fight scene was a little long, but I can't say anything bad about this movie. The actors did an exceptional job, the plot was great, the special effect were practically realistic, and an overall adrenaline rush from start to finish. Christopher Nolan may not have directed this movie, but I'm sure his presence as producer and co-writer greatly changed the final product. Man of Steel is a must see movie.",

        "I guess we can't have it both ways. So many things in this movie were so poorly thought out it was to hard for me to keep my brained switched off and just enjoy it for the entertainment it was meant to be.\n\nAnd I think it should have ended dark. Would have been much better to have Sup loose this round. I wanted to heard Zod say it. Kneel before Zod. I want his take on the iconic statement, and say it to Superman in front of the world to see, then end with Sup kneeling...roll credits...\n\nThat would get me back for number two. As it stands now, not a chance. I would suggest tone down the fight scenes a tad. They were over the top big time.",
        "I'm sorry but this Superman is only laughable, there are nice parts when Kevin Costner shows the side of the family and tell a little about his childhood but getting to end of the film is only too heavy and excessively action mister Zack Snyder ! Is really not comparable with the old superman of Richard Donner with this great vintage touch and also not too much boom boom and only explosions and fights how Zack Snyder shows ! Pity is that he will direct now also Batman vs. Superman, I' m curious what he will destroy there of the legendary comic heroes ! we will see and hope that someone will be able to do a great story like Christopher Nolan did !",
        "I will say that when I was watching this movie, I had no expectation. I'm not like a DC or marvel fans etc. I like a lot the dark knight, but it's not just because the 'batman' but because the film is no doubt making a good quality.\n\nwatching some aliens, fighting each other, crushing all over the place, there's the win there's the loose. oh wait, also some deep story of free will human concept, deep background of 'man of steel' it self, and a very good introducing to the people in common for loving this 'next-wannabe-trilogy or sequels'.\n\nI must say that I never read any superman's comics, but then I feel like I so knew about him after I watched this movie. This movie is a complete package of super hero movie. and yes, I was feeling satisfied when this movie was started to end. And now even I am still thinking of the movie, and cannot wait for the sequel. :D",
        "I liked the reboots of Batman directed by Christopher Nolan and I watched this movie with Nolan as its producer.\n\nThe script is shallow (no humour, no moral struggle, even no eroticism - which would have given it a slight interest), the actors are very bad, the depictions of Metropolis, Smallville or even the desert are avoided.\n\nMy advice for you is not to do what I did: save yourself 2 and 1/2 hours. Watch the Superman movies with Christopher Reeves instead. They're far far better (Gene Hackman for humour, the main character for moral struggle, and Valerie Perrine for eroticism - in the first one).",
        "Now I haven't seen the earlier superman or superhero films but comparing them to the modern superhero movies like Spider-man, The Dark Knight, Green Lantern, X-Men, and The Avengers this is the best superhero movie I've ever seen. This movies delivers explosive action and a story that keeps so in too it. The thing that really surprised me were the special effects. This movie had the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie Seems like the special effects nowadays are at a new era. This movie along with The Dark Knight are the best superhero movies with Man of Steel a little better. This movie is in my top 10 best movies I've ever seen but the best superhero movie.",
        "When film producers decide to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a film and pour all of that money into just the special effects, this is the kind of nonsensical, annoying, plot-hole- filled product that results. It doesn't matter how good (or overpaid) the cast is, if the script and editing is this poor, all they've done is wasted the whole budget. I like to watch films that leave me with something to ponder, films which inspire, films which are clever, with plots that hold together under reasonable scrutiny. They really should have just taken some of the better elements from the comics rather than writing the most improbable, ridiculous, storyline they could come up with. This was just a waste of time (for me to watch) and seems to illustrate something I've noticed is becoming true: the bigger the budget, the bigger the (likelihood of) failure. Some might say this was an \"epic\" film; I'd say it was an epic failure.",
        "I approached this film with high expectations, and they were definitely exceeded. A big comic book fan, I was pleased to see all of the references and inspiration from Superman literature. This film captured the struggle Clark Kent goes through trying to find himself. It is able to have a huge emphasis on story while providing excellent action. Zack Snyder was able to modernize Superman, and make him relevant once again. No movie is perfect, and this movie does have a few Errors, but none so significant they would detract from the viewing experience. Man of Steel gives us a Superman for today, and is faithful to the superman of the past.",
        "This movie is a heart-filled, well-acted, epic dc movie. This movie isn't perfect but it's very far from being a B movie. And it weren't for Man of Steel there wouldn't such thing as the DCEU. And this movie is not only directed by Zack Znyder, but also CHRISTOPHER NOLAN; yeah the, director of the Dark Knight Trilogy, Christopher Nolan; so this movie is very good. But the reason why it gave it a 9/10 because there's Wonder Woman and you know how good that movie was",
        "This movie sucked.The beginning of DC's shitty movies.",
        "Finally a film about superman worth watching. Its perfect in every way, even from the story telling to the action. Critics slate it saying to much action, superman is to serious! I'm sorry but if superman was real that is how a superman fight would go down. Old superman films are full of cheese this is full of emotion the way superman should be. Loved the way in which his world was shown. I truly think every actor and actress was perfect for each roll. Russell Crow was boss! Also HANS ZIMMER oh my goddddd perfect once again great music taking it from a great film to an amazing one! Every piece of music made beautiful for each part. Watched it Friday and still on a massive high. Look forward to watching it again.",
        "This new movie about the man of steel is amazing and makes see the origin of epic and exciting superman, with good special effects and good action and Henry cavill as superman is the right one is an inspirational movie, but gives the man of steel a more dark and with suspense and more or less boring, but has a good villain as zod",
        "Forget the critics. Man of Steel is a whole new look at Superman and not just another remake of the original. A perfect composition of effects, action, characters and an intriguing plot. Top notch cinematography, screenplay, soundtracks and casting - Lois and Clark are great and Clark finally has a very well developed character. Fast-paced with lots of action and momentary pauses to catch your breath at dramatic scenes invoking emotion. Great watch for any one who enjoys a movie, brilliant to super hero fans and will be orgasmic for fans of the Superman series. Although Iron Man 3 was good and a much awaited World War Z is on the way, Man of Steel will have its own class. My take: go for it. Awe will not be denied you. 4.5/5 Enjoy!",
        "First of all i want to say that i love Zack Snyder's 300 and i know that he can make very good movies. Man of steel. What happened with the camera. The camera was trembling sooo much. It was terrible. Also there are no big problems with the screenplay. Directing ruined the film. Snyder showed us a dark version of Superman, in a movie so dark while he tried to tell us that he was a hopefull hero. Just watch this and then watch the Donner's versions. The difference is that Superman in the older films, actually gives hope. the actors did a great job but they couldnt save the movie.",
        "It really reached the expectatives: A bad movie as any superman movie.\n\nI hope a can watch a good superman movie before I die.",
        "I don't love or hate 'Man of Steel', it's just a forgettable movie.",
        "I watched this movie twice this weekend and boy, the top critics were so wrong. Most of the top critics are stuck in the past and are used to the melancholy type superman. Man of Steel by far, is the best superhero movie so far. Superman embodied the super strength and abilities given to him in a perfect way. I just cant see how they're going to come up with a worthy human adversary other than super strong aliens with his type of abilities. He's basically indestructible and the franchise will have to continue in the science fiction genre it took. Any attempt to please the so called top critics will by toning down superman to Doner's 1978 type will ultimately be the demise of this new franchise.",
        "This take on the Man Of Steel is new fresh and action packed filled with breathtaking visuals that are a feast for the eyes, Man of Steel in short you can once again believe that a man can fly in this epic explosive spectacular gritty strong out of this world breathtaking pic with a perfect Superman in Henry Cavill so do not worry he does the role proud and I am sure the great Christopher Reeve would be proud of him, the suit is new and darker but you will not miss the red underwear everything is fresh and new with a element of fun, the one tip I will give is view this in IMAX wow it will blow your mind maybe leave you with a headache but it is worth it however for me I have to say that there is little 3D, please be warned that this is no reboot or remake it is a rebirth of a legend see this and you will not be disappointed grab the popcorn and hang on for a super ride that you will never forget as this for me is a must see and one you have seen it like me you will want to see it again.",
        "While not as horrible as some have claimed, Man of Steel is still a film with serious problem. On the surface, there is a lot of good, state of the art special effects, lots of exciting action, a more \"Serious\" attitude, and generally good casting and acting. The problem is that the film is all surface. There is very little character and thematic development. This hurts the film when it tries to develop an emotional or logical connection to the viewer. Worse is the fact that actual pacing film is abysmal. It has no flow or rhythm thereby flattening the impact of all the scenes. In the end, it feels empty in that I never had a sense that was really about anything more than two Superpower aliens duking out on earth. That movie could have been made in 90 minutes.\n\nI have no problem with a reinterpreted Superman. I just wish a better movie could have been built around him.",
        "We watched \"Man of Steel\" last night. I had really looked forward to this movie and although it started out fairly good, it went south about 1/4 way through. I thought the story line was hap hazard with little to no chemistry development between any of the characters and way too over the top destruction of things in the movie. It seemed the writers formula was placing characters here and there with little to no substance or reason. They went with a darker character development and just stripped Superman of anything that made him Superman. And WTF?.... no Clark Kent until the very end???? Big name actors.... Russell Crow, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and the biggest mistake of all..... Laurence Fishburne as Perry White?.... None of these actors could save this movie. This was a first class butcher job in my opinion.",
        "this movie is AMAZING !those marvel fans is so idiots... they post negative texts and give 1/10 in movie.... IGNORE THEM!!!!just go and see the movie.. we all saw avengers and we like it!!!!! but u need to relax!!!i don't know why someone want to put 1/10 or 2/10 to a good movie.. only to destroy the rating??so much anger,i can sense the dark side of the force inside them....If this was compared to Iron man 3 iron man gets 7 and man of steel gets 9... is far more good than iron man 3, movies like man of steel and avengers and of course the dark knight is top superhero movies ever.. u need to watch this movie . . .is brilliant ! THIS IS SUPERMAN!!!!!!!!",
        "Each time I try to watch another comic-book derivative absurd I wonder if I am from another planet, or people who create such movies are from another world. I can't understand how one can enjoy such total nonsense. There is a couple of interesting scenes in this movie, but most of the time I felt like watching someone playing a bad action computer game with characters smashing one another thru buildings... Definitely a masterpiece for some other race, I am not sure if you need to e a superhuman, or subhuman to enjoy this kind of movies.",
        "So I'd give the movie trailer a 9/10 - but unfortunately it had about all the great scenes in it. Sad b/c Crowe and Costner are cast so well - actually most characters are good, but the plot is just so cheesy - I had to gasp out loud in some scenes. The greatest battle for me was fighting myself to like this movie only to lose out hope.",
        "When Man of steel was released I was very exited, after the huge success of Nolan's Batman trilogy I was looking forward for the same to be done to Superman. The old Superman who was slightly comedic is long gone and the dark hero which proved so popular for the caped crusader is here! I'm very impressed the way this movie concept was dealt with and the fact that it shows good character development. It wasn't as gritty as the Batman films but we certiantly saw a different side to Superman. I also love the fact that they gave Supermans home planet Krypton even more back story and showed us what exactly the planet looked like. The CGI was on point, most super hero movies are just violent without a real plot (Avengers) where as this movie showed more plot to go with the awesome battles within it. The story has set up well for more sequels but to be honest I am worried about the upcoming Superman vs Batman movie, maybes that should of made a sequel first where they introduce Lex Luther before jumping straight into this movie",
        "The dark undertone throughout the movie was completely unnecessary to me. I would have preferred the original color. It is superman what can I say. The story is VERY emotional this time, maybe a little too much. Enjoyed Henry's portrayal. Though I might add Superman comes across as weak at times as compared to Amy Adam's Lois Lane. I suppose it has been going on for a time and this is the rise of Superman so he is allowed to be vulnerable. General Zod is very vocal. Russel Crowe is great and his segments were thrilling and fun to watch. The action is too much in this movie, drags on and on. Same with the destruction, entertainment alright.",
        "This movie really did stink it up for me. Though I am a loyal Marvel fan, I have enjoyed 2 of the 3 Dark Knight Trilogy movies (Thought Dark Knight Rises wan't worth the hype after The Dark Knight). Zac Snyder ruined this movie--it felt and looked too much like the weird CGI in 300. Too much weird space stuff, it felt too cold--to 'steel', just like the title explains. Superman really wasn't the main character, but Krypton and Russell Crowe were.\n\nThey did a good job capturing the DC concept of Krypton, but I didn't come to see a movie about Krypton--I came to see a movie about Superman. Too much dark CGI for me. I saw it in 2-D; can't imagine how much darker the 3-D glasses would have made it. Big Disappointment. Too much CGI fighting, and not enough humanity and emotion. 2 Thumbs down and a big Toe!!",
        "In my own opinion, this is the best Superman movie. And I also like that they use this movie for the DC universe. Can't wait for the other DC Comics movie like Cyborg, Green Lantern (Reboot), Wonder Woman, the Flash, Green Arrow, Aquaman and the Justice League movie.\n\nI also like the flashback style of the movie wherein they fit the past of Clark Kent. Overall, this movie is great and exciting. The fight scene was great and it looks like the fight in the comics. I just hope they chose a younger Lois Lane actress because I think Amy Adams is a bit old for the role. Anyway, she was cool and a great actress so I guess she fits.",
        "Veey bad and loasing consistency...bad scenario bad acting bad directing.",
        "Zack Synder's adaptation of this all-American superhero is no doubt a lot darker and gritter than the Christopher Reeves era. It makes more sense too than the insanely ludicrous plot of the first Superman (spin Earth in opposite direction to reverse time, anyone?). For one, Man Of Steel (MOS) has a fantastic action choreography. The fighting sequences were breathtaking, and even Oscar-worthy I feel. But, unfortunately, the plot isn't. Zack tries to make it deep and dense with uses of deep quotes and somewhat meaningful moments which are flashbacks of Clark's life but ultimately came out shallow. Character development was pretty mediocre for me. The characters were so one-dimensional, even the Superman himself. Overall, this may be the \"Superman Begins\" of a new series of the darker, and more realistic Superman films. I just hope the sequel will have a better plot, one that will be engaging.\n\n7/10",
        "Take the basics from the plot of 80's Superman I and II and then add imaginary from the last movies the directors have seen...\n\n.- Take Avatar for the over-baroque intro from Krypton and add a bit of Matrix for the floating baby nurseries .- Wolverine for the semi-naked and bearded hero lingering thru the village .- Fantastic Four 2 on aliens drilling the Earth core? of course! .- Remember Twister and the dog from Independence Day? got a way to get rid of Super's dad .- Take out the beam from the silent Gigantic Robot from Thor and beat also a bit out our Superhero... ah! the Otto Octopus mechanical arms would be cool, maybe you add them later to any ship you find\n\nToo much to my taste to say the least and let the sequels roll...",
        "Outstanding! Man of Steel is the best superman movie yet and according to me this is the best of all the superhero movies which has released yet!\n\nJack Snyder has done it again. There is a unique style to his movies be it 300 or Watchmen. Man of Steel reflects yet another unique style which I have not seen in any other superhero movie.\n\nI am not good at writing reviews but all I can say that guys go and watch this film. The movie tells the story of Clark in a really original (one of its kind) way which should not be missed.\n\n10/10..",
        "I went to watch this movie, expecting an epic movie. What I received was a mixture of emotions. I personally liked the movie, but there were some things that I did not like, which of course applies to all movies. The acting, the action sequences, and of course the CGI were all great. But, I felt that Clark's character was not fully developed for a startup to what I anticipate will be a good Superman trilogy. The plot also felt subpar, in fact one of my friends mentioned afterward how it was similar to that of Superman TV shows we watched as children. Zack Snyder does a good job directing, not to mention the score by Hans Zimmer. But, overall I felt that this movie is a good follow-up to the epic Dark Knight trilogy and lays the foundation for a future successful DC comics trilogy, if not the upcoming Justice League movie.",
        "If you like special effects, this is your movie. But, if you like some character development and humor, rent the Chris Reeves versions(s). The special effects tried to top 9/11 when it came to destroying buildings. I just sat there thinking, \"Oh no, not another building.\" As far as the story is concerned, forget every thing you ever remember about Superman. They changed 90%. I am old enough to have seen all of the previous movies and read all of the old comics. The creators of this fiasco need to remember that sometimes less is more. You can't substitute characters with explosions and constant action. And when did Lois become a red head? She knows who Clark is from the start. Lois not knowing was what made the other version so superior to this one.",
        "Well done Snyder, Goyer, Nolan-you have delivered a superb film for the original hero. Man of Steel connects well to the Dark knight trilogy with ease, in style and substance. It is a great new reboot of the DC franchise and will be the beginning of DC hero films of critical and commercial success. The film starts perfectly and then moves quickly into great story telling mode, which does not hold back in showing superman in all his glory- excellent action and special effects with a deep story and caring characters of great respect. Performances and casting is perfect all round,especially Shannon, but cavil does a great job also. Crowe is the best though. The film stays true to the source material (unlike ironman 3, which is a disgrace) go see it once, twice, it's worth multiple viewings and will go down as the best superman film so far, period.",
        "First of all, this could be the best Superman movie. Right from the costume everything is attractive. The acting of Henry, Shannon, Russel, Diane and Kevin are good. The story is straight forward but not the screenplay. It is directed by Zack Snyder, but still we feel the same touch of Nolan in Batman Begins.\n\nBeing a no super-hero fan and became a big fan of Batman by Nolan, I could not accept a super-hero with extraordinary powers like this. At times, the destruction made by Superman and Zod is very high. The scene where Clark attacks Zod for threatening his mother is awesome. Once again the cameo of Kevin Costner is superb.\n\nIts being a superhero movie, we are not able to stoop comparing this with the other superheros. Thus this reboot has made the Superman to catch a position in top 5 superheros but definitely not the first, Batman is the ultimate",
        "Worst superman movie ever made. The cameraman moved the camera a lot so I couldn't really focus on the characters faces. The effects look very fake compared to other movies and some of the acting was bad.",
        "Fantastic film very well cast. Fight scenes were a bit too drawn out and some minor plot holes. But by far the best superhero movie ever made to date. Cavil was surprisingly fantastic with a good depth to his character but i did feel a lack of empathy for him. Zod, thank god he wasn't camp like in Superman! he was actually quite menacing. There was no humor in the movie which is a good. Overall i feel the script had flaws but it did not distract from the over all epicness. I think the film is up on par with the dark knight at a solid 9/10 i just hope for the next man of steel the keep the action and passion up and the cgi and blurry scenes to a minimum. Also ha ha ha ha ha superman was a brit !!",
        "I had so much high hopes for man of steel after the great first trailer, but as time went by and more trailers where released i feared for the movie. So today i finally saw it and sadly it did not pleased me the way i was hoping for! When Hollywood gonna learn CGI wont make a good movie, it sure puts it for the eye, but bad acting, big plot holes, loose ends and dumb solutions can literally kill the joy, and thats what i think it happened with superman on this movie. Sure its better than the atrocious last one, but it still ain't good like the classic superman movies. Yet its a good pastime for the fans like myself, but i still wanna see a well done superman movie on my lifetime.",
        "Do you think that film producers of modern films will ever listen to that quiet voice whispering, \"you're overdoing this CGI gimmick, chaps. It doesn't impress people like in the early days. Give it a rest.\"?? The basic story wasn't bad but I began to yawn at the overdose of CGI. I prefer a witty dialogue, a director who will let the actors and actresses act and won't bombard us with a thumping over-aggressive sound track. Or have those days gone for good? Maybe that's the reason why they haven't remade \"The Godfather\" - there's no opportunity for them to stick twenty minutes of CGI to impress the masses. It really is a plus when a film reaches the cinemas which is noted for its dialogue and acting and a decent story line.",
        "Not for soy boys. Amazing movie and action is still best even in 2022. Wish there is dragon ball z movie with this style of action. Marvel and dc dropped the balls on action when this movie should of been standard for comic movies action scenes.",
        "I was looking forward to seeing Man Of Steel and for all the \"hype\" I have seen and heard about this film I was very disappointed. I can only say it appears that Warner Bros. gave a budget to some first year film makers because this colossal waste of time has poor script, poor story line and extremely poor special effects. Not even noteworthy actors as Lane Costner, Fishburne and Crowe could save this train wreck. The beginning of the film is tolerable and looks like it might be a very good film but then with the first flight of Superman and the apparent cheap special effects it's all down hill. It would also appear to cover up the lack of story line the film makers rely on more cheap special effect destruction. Sitting through the last 30 minutes of this catastrophe was painful and I truly felt embarrassed for Warner Bros.",
        "A big movie which stood upon its standards.No need to tell you people to go and watch it.The cast was good and did its job properly.It was different from other superman movies as expected from Christopher Nolan.It had a good mixture of present and past.A detailed discussion on weather the world will use Superman for good or bad.\n\nThe Good :The movie had awesome realistic and gloomy touch. Super cool 3D fight. Good detailed plot.Finally he wears his underwear inside.Super bad ass enemy.\n\nThe Bad :Just for the sake of writing lets say it Just had a little to much building smashing nothing more.\n\nI recommend you to watch it in 3D cinema because of its good fighting scenes.",
        "Some people will think I am mad but I never really got gripped by a Super Man film before, think it was something to do with the bright red under pants and the hair glued to the scalp. This Super Man changed all that, Nolan has thrown another in depth, imaginative remake into the world of cinema. I know he hasn't directed this film but his influence is evident as the story has good structure, a scientific edge and keeps you guessing throughout. I watched this film with an open mind and really enjoyed it. I just can't wait to watch Nolan's next film weather he has written, directed or just produced it!! Hope you enjoy it :-)\n\nkamibahrami",
        "Man of steel is probably the best superhero movie behind batman(dark knight) and the avengers! I was worried about this movie after watching the dark knight rises and wondered how Nolan could blow this movie! Because seriously, when you create the dark knight people will expect something better than that (and the rises wasn't even close)! But actually Man of Steel was better than expected.\n\nPeople will criticize for it not as good as Nolans other movies. But in truth this is the first movie of the new Superman franchise! Was the batman begin as good as the follow ups? No, it was good. So is the Man of Steel! The plot is set in a way that only way this franchise should go is UP! And thanks to God for not letting Bryan Singer destroying the superman franchise!",
        "First and foremost Man of Steel was everything and more I imagined. A very good reboot compared to Superman Returns which had nothing to do with any of the original Superman Movies before years before, it was a pure waste of time and money. Moving on Man of Steel was different in every way from Christopher Reeves version. I'm glad it was different to me that's point of a reboot be different from the previous version. Richard Donner did a fantastic job on the original Superman Movie I still love watching it till this very day. That was a different time and a very different era. Christopher Nolan and Zach Snyder did a fantastic job of making this there on version of Superman witch gave us a more detailed view into the history of Krypton. The Christopher Reeves Era ended with last episode of Smallville as it should have. Man of Steel was darker than any other Superman Movie has been and I thought is great being seen in that type of light.",
        "henry cavill is amazing in this film I admit I had my doubts about him but I'm really glad cast him both my sisters my mum my brother and my nephew thought the film was absolutely amazing and want to watch it again I thought Michael Shannon and Russell crowe were great too but didn't like the casting choices for the Kent's Lois lane and perry white i also didn't like the fact that they didn't play the classic theme song it just doesn't seem like a proper superman film without the theme song but I'm willing to let that slide because the movie itself was so amazing I can't wait for it to come out on DVD oh what joy it will to watch henry over and over again",
        "A very mediocre escapist fantasy.\n\nHero movies are 99% special effects, clich\u00e9s and without any story depth like Evangelion or Serial Experiments Lain.",
        "It just goes on and on and on and on and on. Boring but pretty...expensive. You can judge this book by its cover. Superficial nonsense. This is two hours you'll never get back. Brightburn is a better movie. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.",
        "This movie is amazing and a great start to establish the style for this universe. The movie starts very big and epic on the last days of krypton with an excellent performance by Russell Crowe as Jor el, Ayelet Zurer as Lara and Micheal Shannon as Zod. Jumping in to the present of the movie we see a Superman trying to find out who he is. Henry Cavills Superman is amazing and the way he embodies him and how different he is, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were perfect as his adoptive parents. The tone and style of this movie is excellent, the theme that can a alien be accepted in this world, if you are a father raising an alien how to protect him and knowing to have all the powers to save lives and remain hidden with fear how the world will accept you. Zod in this movie is great a complex villain that thinks that what he is doing is the right thing even if he is wrong to be a little bit over shadowed by Faora (Antje Traue) excellent performance. Its a well written drama with a lot of soul in it that have been overshadowed and blindsd people with simplistic and mediocre film making from other superhero films.",
        "I cannot believe all the corporate written reviews on here about this movie. If you skip the first 20 or so reviews you may get some truth! In a nutshell this movie is a sprawling shaky cam mess. A complete waste of some excellent casting choices and one hopes they all return with a different director. I won't go into detail but to say one left the cinema feeling like I had been watching a poor quality video game, some of the cgi was so badly paced I'm sure that even on the biggest screen in the world you would not be able to see what was going on. Don't believe the hype, the trailers do an excellent job of hiding what this movie is. At least Superman returns understood what this franchise was about (I know it wasn't perfect) but I remember leaving the cinema feeling like I had just watched a Superman movie. The same cannot be said for my feelings last night.",
        "As a graduate of the Christopher Reeve era, I had a lot of nostalgia to get over before I could allow myself to love another Superman series. If anyone can though, Christopher Nolan can; so I was positive about Henry Cavill's chances of starting a new chapter in the Superman catalogue. Nolan delivers all the polish and incredible visuals that we've come to expect from him; and also, the characters have resonance and depth as always. Cavill is solid and believable as the tortured hero. I'm sure his next outing will allow him to show his leading man status to the full. For what it is, Man of Steel is good and well worth your hard-earned money, but somehow I can't help thinking that this particular superhero does not fit the 'Dark Knight' treatment. I certainly don't want a reboot of the overly moralistic and saccharine sweet Superman series, but where is the fun Mr. Nolan...? Purely for the addition of laughs, I rate The Avengers Assemble and the Iron Man films ahead of Man of Steel, but it's still a great piece of cinema...!,",
        "There was too much gratuitous violence in this movie. I enjoyed the sci-fi elements and the main actors, but I was not drawn into the story as I had been for the original Superman movies with Christopher Reeve. I felt so much for Lois Lane and Clark Kent/Superman in Superman II, and I have always felt that their love story anchors the best films, but I was rather disappointed with the effect that this has. Maybe I'm just getting old, as my kids (ages 11-12) certainly enjoyed Man of Steel more, but this movie really left me wanting more. Hopefully the sequels will deliver. All in all, I'm excited that Superman is back, but it is far from the best. I would rank Superman II and even Superman Returns ahead of Man of Steel.",
        "The CGI was great. Way, Way to much of it. It was exactly what I had expected. I fast forwarded through most of the movie. This movie is for the simple minded and special effects fans. There were other movies previously made on this subject that were true to the character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster. The dialog is stilted and amateurish and awful, the kind of stuff that makes you feel very embarrassed for the actors. The special effects are quite good, but there is a relentless, nonstop barrage of them, and the plot bangs from pillar to post, often making any sense. This is far and away the worst of the Superman movies -- a super dud.",
        "Very, very disappointing. I had really high hopes for this one, but as soon as I saw the second trailer I understood that it will be very serious approached (like Nolan's Batman trilogy) and much less in a fun superhero way (like the Iron Man trilogy for example). On the one hand I don't like the idea of making superhero movies dark and serious, because superheroes should be fun and charismatic in my opinion. On the other hand The Dark Knight was good even though it hadn't any fun in it. Now back to Man of Steel which tried to be a serious superhero movie but ended up as non-sense action flick. The plot is lacking and the half of it are pointless fighting scenes that just doesn't want to end. The world superman comes from (Krypton) was made in an awkwardly ridiculous way, and Zod is a horrible villain with a funny voice. Man of Steel takes itself extremely serious and forbids itself to be funny even for a second, which made it only worse. You can find more reviews for movie that are in theaters now on my profile.",
        "LOUD,LOUD,LOUD!!! It was so loud in the second half that I had to put my fingers in my ears! If a movie goer with normal hearing has to do that it's TOO STINKING LOUD!!! And even with plugged ears I could hear the dialog perfectly. And a friend who saw it at a different movie chain said the same thing. When I get it on Netflix or stream it on Amazon I will mute the sound and put on closed captioning for the second half.\n\nThe plus is the CAST; especially Henry Cavill, possibly the best looking human being on earth. Seriously. And he can act, too so double threat.\n\n'nough said.",
        "OMG, That is my rating. Zach Synder has changed the comic book genre forever. Gone is the silliness of previous superman movies, this is serious business. The consequences are dire, the emotions are heartfelt, the casting spectacular, the action relentless.\n\nRead the negative reviews and you will find all the reasons to love this movie. The purists hate it because the end of an era is upon us. Synder has set the helm to the future and a new world awaits us. He has provided us \"a good death\" from the past.\n\nThis movie is not so much a retelling of the original story as a new beginning that leaves the future of this genre, well, Super Man.",
        "Just watched Man of steel and enjoyed watching it very much. there were some negative reviews about this movie but i still decided to give it a go and the movie turned out to be very good.. the best thing abt the movie was henry cavill. he looks perfect as supeman and gives a mind blowing performance. The action was too good, especially at the ending sequence. the flashbacks showing clark's relationship with his father and dealing with being special when he was young were extraordinary good.. but the main drawback of the movie was that it was focused a lot on action than story. if the writers would have concentrated on story more than it would have been a masterpiece. but still it was a very good movie. superman finally gets the movie it deserves. i give it 9 out of 10",
        "He is not Superman, he is just a man of steel. Please don't claim yourself as SUPERMAN cause you will never do.\n\nThis is the stupidest superhero's movie that I'd ever seen. I know there is no one can replace Christopher Reeve, and I do not expect the man of steel will be like Chris's movies. However, I can't accept that Superman is more like a cold-hearted violent alien than human being. Superman will never kill no matter what, he is a warmhearted superhero.\n\nPlease no more outer space war, no more alien attack earth, no more same old story. I need something new, please think out of the box. Don't just change the superhero's name and repeat the same thing.",
        "Poorly paced, poorly directed mess of a film. Snyder was a bad choice for this. The CGI battle scenes were gratuitous and unnecessarily long,Lois and Clark romance felt forced and rushed and Snyders use of the shaky-cam was distracting and silly. If you want to watch superman fly around and punch people into buildings without any care or conseuqense to anyone you are in for a treat. Otherwise wait till DVD. Oh, please see it in the 2D, 3D is not worth the extra cost for this",
        "This is the only portrayal of Superman that it close to an accurate representation of what the Man of Steel would be like in this earth. He is ground character with fitting and just emotions.\n\nWell done Mr. Snyder - if ever a director should have been allowed to complete his vision, you are the person",
        "First of all, I give a thumbs up for the great cast. They did a great job as acting out their characters. The effects also gets a thumbs up from me. It's great and I love it.\n\nBut for me, the movie is kinda dull and over dramatic. And the movie is also too loud and too many crashing sounds. Most of the parts that I like is actually the flashbacks rather than the war with Zod. I didn't even see Superman's fight with Zod because I was asleep!\n\nI think the movie is too long. The same thing that I thought about Christopher Nolan's Batman Series. I actually like his series of Batman but it's just too long. Maybe if the movie is cut down a little bit and tone done the too dramatic parts, I would really like it.\n\nBut still overall, I didn't really like it.",
        "This is an exciting adventure movie, that's all! Full of actions and visual effect. But script is not strong! There are irrational scenes, especially, it's a total disappointment and funny to see that some people are still working at their office or some people are still visiting museums some blocks away where a dozens of F16s were exploded, a spaceship landed and several skyscrapers are destroyed. It is also interesting to see US army let a journalist girl to get on board in the most important operation and let her conduct final bombing. I am also fed up to see that friends of the main characters never die or get injured while the half of new york is destroyed!",
        "Recently in the film world, there's been a trend of action movies actually being of quality. That didn't used to be. I have gotten used to having high-caliber action films, so Man of Steel is a bit of a shock. The movie is 90% people punching each other and 10% super-beings arguing with each other or with government authorities. If you go watch a WWE wrestling match and then Cops, you'll essentially have just watched Man of Steel. Here's a good suggestion: put this movie on while working on a work project or homework assignment. Don't pay attention to it at all. By the time the movie finishes, you will have absorbed every bit of the movie's story. You know why? Because there isn't one.",
        "Good movie; I have no idea why film critics like Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic have rated this movie well below what it actually deserves. Personally, I think people need to change the review board on many of these websites - they are just spoiling the film in terms of its promotions, especially in India.\n\nAs for the movie- Excellent background scores by Hans Zimmer; Story is about Superman's origins - similar to Batman Begins of the Dark Knight trilogy; Definitely expecting a really good sequel to this; Nolan should step it up and recreate the magic he wrote \"The Dark Knight\" in the coming sequel for this venture to succeed; As for the hero, its a classic Superman movie - definitely reiterated my faith for Superman as a hero, so in that aspect, thank you to Christopher Nolan and David Goyer. Hope that the next sequel is extremely good.",
        "Whole movie screamed epic.Performances were solid and vfx looked legit.That score however.....damn! It added a whole new level I immersed myself in. Kudos to Hanz Zimmer.The first half of the movie he was searching for his identity and found it at the end. This is a origin story/reboot. We're not gonna see the All Star Superman or even the DCAU Supes id because he just started. By the next flick he'll own the role.Then about 2015 reboot film Affleck has the age, the build, and the presence to play a veteran Batman believably.\n\nAs Final World, With this Strong base,can't wait to expand the DC Universe in this next chapter. Let's face it, it's beyond mythological to have Superman and our new Batman facing off, since they are the greatest Super Heroes in the world.",
        "The Start was stupid: the father of superman could have kill that evil guy but he didnt and then evil-guy stabbed him\n\nThe End was stupid: the man with all that power ends up to be journalist?",
        "In short, Brilliant movie, Great visual effects, Deep Drama, Great Action & Great Cast. What more do we need right? .. there was a very slight issue with editing here but its barely noticeable. Henry C. did a great job as a superman. His body language fits the character. Moreover, Hans Zimmer made this movie better and better with the OST. Critics mentioned \"there is too much action\" ?!! U gotta be kidding me right. Its a SUPERMAN movie, a GREAT SUPER HERO. Do expect more tears,drama etc.. than action??? Give us a brake critics and get a life OK. The movie is highly recommended for fans. DON'T MISS IT. It deserves an Oscar or 2 if not more.",
        "Not sure if the critics and I saw the same movie, their consensus is in that Man of Steel is \"watchable\" or \"worth seeing\". I saw this in 3D with my Dad last night, we had been talking about it all week. We crushed a tub of popcorn in the first 30 minutes, totally enthralled, the visual effects are stunning. There's some great performances behind all the CGI flash as well - Michael Shannon is certainly making a name for himself in the psychotic acting dept., Costner is fantastic as Clark's Earth father. Russell Crowe, as always is great. If you love action/comic book/sci fi this will be like Christmas Day for you. It's not The Dark Knight, but Man of Steel is excellent in it's own way. If you're not the biggest comic book buff or even if you have no idea who Christopher Nolan is, you will still have a blast. To all the critics saying Man of Steel is just \"watchable\", I'd like to know what you're watching that's so damn great.",
        "The Batman is everything I wanted. Thank you Matt Reeves, casts and creators! Matt Reeves is The GOAT. Wow I can't believe how perfect this film is! Cinematography is amazing. Score is amazing. Story is amazing. Only 5 minutes of Barry's Joker, but you can see so much potential. MoS mid.",
        "Let me sum it up...Great visuals, beautiful scenes and sets, great action but absolutely no good story telling at all. No chemistry at all between Lois and Clark, and choppy rushed flashbacks explaining his past. Amy Adams playing Lois Lane was mediocre at best. Henry Cavil could have been a great superman, if they had given him something better to work with. Boring after the first half of the movie. I can't believe people would compare The Dark knight to this jumbled mess. The Dark Knight was one of the best super hero movies and this one was one of the worst. I was such a fan of the original superman movies and this one was such a disappointment.",
        "Very disappointing movie, just see the Jonathan Kent stupid dead for a dog and how superman was a coward to save his father, and compare it to the original one when the young superman was really impotent to do anything for his father with a heart attack... Metropolis is never mentioned, the final Clark Kent with glasses is far more evident than the Reeve one...\n\nAhhh please don't talk about the soundtrack without Williams!\n\nI really supposed that Nolan will do something more but it was my mistake, What can I say Alexander Salkind and Donner please forgive Nolan and Snyder!\n\nI need to see the 1978 movie again! (I see it when I was 9 ;) )",
        "Man Of steel is super F..in awesome,Oh my god man,i tell u its the most action packed movie ever,i don't wanna spoil any details but the best epic action visual extravagant filled superman movie ever SEEN,its story is amazing and the director and the writers made and absolute masterpiece, if u value the true masterpiece of movies please i advice you to go to your nearest theaters and see it, and please don't download it, its worth it. Awesome movie going for it one more time. Yayyyy. The combination of Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan, David S Goyer, and the music genius Hanz Zimmer, made this an exceptional piece of Art. Henry Cavil, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, Diane lane, Lawrence Fishburne, was am excellent choice of cast and this movie deserves a sequel with the same team all together. All Hail Man of Steel. Thanks Warner Brothers for making this amazing movie and a great team making. Awesome movie love it.",
        "This is a very solid superhero movie. The fight scenes were fantastic, the action was fantastic, Superman had depth and was very humane, it had a decent villain, and the direction by Zack Snyder was solid. Henry Cavill did an excellent job as Kal-El, and was almost as good as Christopher Reeve. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner were great fathers, and Diane Lane was great as Martha Kent. The pacing is almost perfect, though there was maybe too much action. Michael Shannon's Zod wasn't as good as Terence Stamp's Zod. I do wish Lois Lane and Clark Kent had some more chemistry, that she didn't know he was Superman the whole time. I think that will take away from the classic banter of the earlier films. Overall this is a very satisfying movie, though not one of the best superhero movies. It's definitely the best Superman movie since the second Christopher Reeve film.",
        "OMG!!!! The fight-scene's are awesome and epic. It's not perfect and the story is told kind of quickly, but we all now the origin story. There is also not a lot of drama.\n\nWhat man of steel does great is give the feel of superman fighting and flying. I love superhero-fights and this film as the most some intense and epic action scene's i have ever seen. Some say there is to much action, but there are really only to fight scene's and the kick ass. The actors who play superman, Zod and his chick super warrior are all great to. I can't wait for the sequel and see superman fight doomsday of Lex or Darkseid.\n\nIf you like superheroes, action or hell, even fun I recommend to see it.",
        "I watched iron man3 , fast and furious 6 and now man of steel and i can easily say this is the best action movie i saw this year.It has everything you wanted to watch in an action movie with a decent story line(better than any of his competitor released this year). Zack Snyder known for his good creative action and he delivers it for a big time. 3D Effects are good, you can watch it in a 2D and find yourself equally amazed but i think 3D completes this movie.I always had this throes that the world most powerful super hero never get the kind of movie that he deserve but now he get one.This is going to be another billionaire movie so i would love to compare this movie with Iron Man 3 in three parameter Action,story,3D effects\n\nIron Man 3:- Action 6, Story 4, 3D Effects 4\n\nMan Of Steel:- Action 9, Story 6, 3D Effects 5",
        "The first 30 minutes feels like they owed Russell Crowe money so we don't even get to the \"Man of Steel\" and by the time we do, there's no time to develop his character arc. It proceeds directly to him saving things and being super. They also go all-in on making this a total Sci-fi space alien film instead of developing the story for our hero, Superman/Clark Kent. That's it.",
        "Man of steel is a fresh take on superman.It doesn't just show superman flying and lifting things up.3-d is a optional choice for people who got a headache watching films like transformers and the hobbit. Henry Cavill's acting is the \"best than the rest\". It has typical Snyder effects with the zooming and all that stuff.The story has been significantly changed and Russell Crowe has a good amount of time on the big screen. Good origin story and 'wow' scenes add up to plenty of awesome things about the film.\n\nTHINGS I REJECT: Only one thing bothers me,if they wanted a dark film either make it like the dark knight or just don't.They just could not decide.\n\nStill it's a watch in theater from me or be the first one to by it in blue-ray",
        "Poorly acted, undermined by a poor script/story, nothing original here. Prepare to sit for 2 hours or whatever, and watch a frankly ridiculous fight you already know the end result of. No worse than any other moronic superhero movie I suppose.",
        "I will have to say this is best film I have seen since last year's The Dark Knight Returns, and was just a great as the Avengers. Placing Superman in a more adult realistic tone was wonderful and puts Superman Returns to shame, I came into seeing Man Of Steel with low expectations and was shocked at how well it was written, and you can see Christopher Nolan's hands all over this puppy, the special effects are off the charts amazing, and I did not even feel the near 2/12 hour running time as I was so involved from beginning to the roll of the credits. My fianc\u00e9 was doubtful as well, but even she was very please and surprised at how great it was! Don't let the fan boys and smart marks keep you away from this movie! All they want to do is be negative on anything that wasn't created \"just for them\"!",
        "Okay... i think this movie is good because casting for superman henry cavill is really awesome, flashback tell what i didn't know about superman, and i got emotional of superman (clark kent) in this movie. there are parts that i hate like clark kent didn't save his father although his has a great power but that doesn't make story will bad because after that clark kent said \"his dad trust him\" so.. overall is good",
        "Man of Steel stands as a fresh and modern take on the characters of Superman and Clark Kent and it paints a picture of what he would look like if he truly existed in our modern and cynical world, this is in stark contrast to the original Superman films of the 1970s. Zack Snyder brings the joy and hopefulness of the character to life throughout multiple scenes in the film that are visually stunning and well acted by Henry Cavill. The standout portrayals are clearly Cavill, as well as Crowe (who plays Jor-El) and Shannon who has a take on General Zod that is more sympathetic than one would think. The action and fight scenes are right out of the comic books and are even five years later still the gold standard for all comic book films. While the film does still have its problems and hindrances with its writing (some characters aren't fleshed out enough and the story isn't well refined) these are easily overlooked by the fact that it is simply too entertaining. Man of Steel, true to the titular character's nature, stands above all others superhero films and provides an ideal to stride towards.",
        "Well, I liked this movie much more than I anticipated. Just really disappointed with the casting of Amy Adams as LL. She is a good actress but LL is supposed to be a dashing and sultry brunette not a cute little red head...ruined it. Terrible choice. Whomever casted her should be slapped. I can see Ricky Bobby falling for her but there is no way Superman is infatuated with an little red head. I just don't see it. It's not believable.\n\nI'd give it a 7 but barely. It was enjoyable and I am sure they spent a fortune on the effects. Really sharp visually.\n\nAlso, the child actor did a much better job than the grown up superman.",
        "My first ever movie to be taken away by was Superman 2 and I have loved the character ever since. So when the teaser advert was released last year with very young superman wearing a makeshift cloak, the boat at sea and the sea gull shot. I got really excited. Really really excited. BUT this just doesn't work. It has all the seeds to be amazing but in the end doesn't deliver. The second half just ends up being a big explosive fight and because it lacks emotion it's a fight for fights sake. The story dropped. The intimacy that began with his struggle with being an outsider in the world dropped. The grainy look of him being a man without a home traveling from town to town dropped. And the result, a blockbuster without the heart, that it promised. I am guessing that it got lost in the editing floor and they decided to go with the big stupid scenes rather than the hearty grainy personal approach. I have given it a 6 cos I love superman and just can't bring myself to give it less. But it deserves less. I am really disappointed.",
        "For decades.Superman has been a perfect icon living in our minds.But time has changed.Perfect superheros are laughed at and criticized nowadays.Just look back at Superman Returns and you may understand. The team could have played it safe and it is probably still a blockbuster.They could have make superman save the world again from Lex Luthor,but they did not.Instead,they focused on the origin of superman and made it more scientific and reasonable adding more explanations and details. The visual effects were spectacular!What's best about this movie could be its action scenes.The destruction scenes look so smooth and natural.Zack Snyder is undoubtedly a master on visuals.Visuals-lovers will love the movie. Watching this movie in 3D really spoil my experience giving me a headache. I would recommend seeing the 2D version for those who easily get headache.Compared to its predecessor Superman Returns,if Superman Returns was rated 5,this movies deserves 10.",
        "Honestly, I went to the cinema 2 times for this movie. It is shown that how special this movie means to me. The movie is quite long, more than 2 hours, but it seems there is nothing abundant. Every singer detail contains its meaning and explanation in a good solidarity and logic. So, even if you have never heard about Superman, you still can easily understand and follow. Once again, even a long movie, but you will never regret when you what it because it came with spectacular visual effects, impressive sound and acting. It even likes a fair tale because its end is a happy ending. It is sure that you will satisfy with the movie in all sides.\n\nTo conclusion, the movie deserved 9 over 10.\n\nVisual effect, especially 3D: 10/10 Sound effect: 9/10 Acting: 8/10 Story: 9/10",
        "This movie is not great, and I can't believe that people actually liked this film. I've seen it a few times but I really can't remember any of it. My first thought was \"this is a cool dragon ball z movie\" This didn't feel like superman at all. People hate Superman Returns because it was boring, I didn't like it either when I was a dumb kid, but now I've found a newfound appreciation for the film because this one was so bad. If you wanna see Superman be Superman go watch Christopher Reeve fly around, and if you are one of those people that don't like Christopher Reeve for some reason than go watch the Max Fleischer cartoons. I hate this movie, I miss Marlon Brando.",
        "Most of my friends didn't like the movie. But I personally feel that this is a good movie. The spotlight, Henry Cavill, didn't let me down. He has that serious look in his face which makes him perfect for this role. Its not the traditional Superman movie where Clark Kent works in Daily Planet and changes into Superman, on the first signs of trouble, to save the day. Its more about how he tries to adjust into the society as a normal person.\n\nRomance was very minimal and unnecessary. Loved the pumped up action scenes. And Russell Crowe is as always awesome!! Snyder could have introduced Lex as a possible candidate for villain if he decides to make a sequel. But as far as i remember i did see a LexCorp gas trunk in the movie. So am keeping my fingers crossed for a sequel.\n\nIts a nice movie. Go for it and don't trust the bad reviews.",
        "Producers over-produced and overdone this movie. Yet, they didn't make it seem ridiculous. It relies purely on fiction and violence. They tried to be creative and they did but it ended in a mess even though the effects are stunning in 3D. We find good cinematographic parts and the plot is also interesting thanks to Christopher Nolan. But then comes Zach Snyder's world that clashes the beauty of the story. Thanks god the acting is at its best and that the IMAX 3D existed, if not it would be a complete failure. I found it disappointing compared to the other Marvel's adaptations. It was too much and you know it, but Superman fans will of course hate this review. DO NOT bring children under 13 to see this movie !!",
        "From the trailers to the TV spots to the actual movie playing before my eyes, everything was spectacularly terrific! A couple of months ago when I first saw the trailer, I got goosebumps. I entered the movie theater, and sat down without a doubt that this picture will fail my amusement. The acting, the music, the filming, everything was great.\n\nThe critics that reviewed this movie badly have minds that are filled with stupidness. \"There's not enough romance\". Critics who have said that are probably nerds who can't get any girls to talk to them so they decided to pretend that they ARE the actual superman in the movie.\n\nAnyways, this movie was excellent and I give it a 10/10.",
        "I had some expectations about this movie but by all means they were realistic. This was a BIG deception and would have been even if I didn't have any expectations. This movie is a franchise obsession and has heavy origin-story laziness ...we all know the story of Superman, why spending more than half the movie telling us the origin of Superman which we all know and not add something new? OK, especial effects are good but it's just big screen technology that it's out there in many movies, so why over-rely on \"bloodless\" violence? and lastly, they could have avoided the super cheesy \"Superman ain't getting more American than that\" closing.",
        "Just to let you know, i am a die-hard superman fan. I love the Donner Movies and I have kept up with the comics as well as Smallville for all 10 seasons. This movie was better than all. First off, for you Smallville fans, the guy that played Lex's clone in season 10 , and the actor the actor that played Hamilton are both in this movie. As well as Amy Adams of course. For the Most part, this movie sticks with the traditional Superman Story. For the minor changes, i think they are for the better. The movie goes more into detail about Krypton, and at the end of this movie, you sort of feel sorry for Zod. But CAVILL. IS. SUPERMAN. He has the Personality of Reeve and the Whit of Dean Cain and the Charm and Overall he reminds me of Tom Welling throughout the whole movie. I cannot wait for the next one!!!",
        "This is one of the least impressive superhero movies I've watched in my entire life. I didn't feel any strong emotion about this. After a time, I found it quite boring even.",
        "One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Superman learns how to fly.Henry's expression when he is flying are just amazing he literally looks like a guy who has just started flying rather than a guy who has been flying his whole life (the 73's superman).The movie is a combination of a good story and some amazing action sequences.My problem with MOS is not the lack of humor nor it is the lack of chemistry between Superman and Lois but it is the mere lack of chemistry between John,Martha and Clark.I personally would have loved to see more of his childhood.Rather than a few flashbacks we get to see nothing about his relationship with John which is quite disappointing.I loved the fact that young Clark was struggling with his powers and felt out of place and alienated but we should have seen more of him.Over all MOS is a very good summer superhero flick with a good story (better than avengers) and some breathtaking action (also better than avengers).If you are looking to have a good time then do watch this movie.",
        "Watching \"Man Of Steel\" and its funny that TV Guide gives it 1 star and yet IMDb gives it 3.5 stars. While I admire the direct Zack Synder (Watchmen, 300), I felt I was watching a sequel to Watchmen and that's not the only problem I had with this movie. I love the cinema aspect of the movie but when you deviate from a origin that's been around for over 75 years, you run the risk of screwing up a formula that didn't need tinkering to begin with.\n\nI realize Synder wanted to put his own spin, interpretation so he can stand out among the rest. But when you try to reboot an establish brand, you often make a mess of things (Amazing Spider-man comes to mind.) And now a sequel is coming and this time Batman & Wonder Woman will join the cast and Zack Synder is directing it. I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck being Batman and I can't say I'm looking forward to the sequel. I hope my mind can be changed once I begin seeing the trailers.",
        "The movie was fantastic everyone who is dissing the movie clearly hasn't saw it yet I loved it. I sat next to one of the most annoying guys and I could still enjoy the movie it was that good. It just had everything you wanted. It had action. It also had so thrill moments. I love that they gave so much emotion to superman. They made it as if he grew up on earth. It didn't make him seem like a robot. So I give it twelve thumbs up. I have actually saw this movie twice already and it impressed me every time. I will probably see it again in the future and I know for a fact that I will buy this movie as soon as it comes out. All the old hardcore fans who loved the old superman movies you have to realize that this movie wasn't made to please only your generation it was made to please this generation and the generations that love the action packed movie",
        "Although the special effects for this movie are clearly at the technological limit for Hollywood, and the action is top-notch, it is unclear what message the producers are intending to convey in the film.\n\nI was not sure if the General Zod character, played by Michael Shannon, was supposed to be good or bad. Through out the film, he claims to be attempting to save \"his people\". I could not see a the problem in this, especially since some of the characters seen in the movie, including the black actor who plays \"Perry White\" are grossly miss-cast. Couldn't the people of Krypton exist on planet Earth? Next time, I suggest the producers spare us the hidden liberal themes.",
        "On short, it's a giant pile of clich\u00e9s. Most of the plot doesn't make sense. Kudos for CGI artists. Thumb down for writers. Examples: - He's father dies in a tornado (?) and Clark does nothing. He can fly out of space but can't stand the wind. It ruins its makeup? - What is this Codex? Because if it is only DNA then it is in every specimen on Krypton. - It's a huge discrepancy between Clark age and he's father's ship age. - I'm sure they had more than 2 spaceships on Krypton. - How a baby with no special powers can survive a trip like this, maybe you can tell me. Remember that he's special powers developed on Earth. - Jumping towards the end, General ZOD it's not Clark's first kill. During the fight in the city he made thousand of (innocent) victims and push back the American economy for decades. - And at the end, let's be serious, a pair of glasses doesn't make so hard to be recognized.\n\nToo bad. Most viewer are more intelligent than this. They deserve better.",
        "Man of Steel is a great start to DC Extended Universe. It's a very good movie.\n\nA really enjoyed Henry Cavill's Superman. He made the Superman a enjoyable character. Amy Adams portrayed a very lovable Lois Lane. Lois is a strong woman character, not just the Superman's love interest.\n\nZack Snyder is a good director. I don't know why he gets so much hate from people. He was the right choice to start the DC Extended Universe\n\nIf you going to watch a Superman's movie, I recommended Man of Steel. A very fun experience.\n\n10/10",
        "i wasn't very hyped to see this movie but because it probably wasn't going to be in theaters much longer,i decided that it wouldn't hurt to try it. this movie is an action-packed blockbuster movie that's sure to thrill all audiences.i guess that the makers of the movie spent a whole lot of money on the effects because they are so good and not only that but the actor who plays superman is just so handsome and masculine so he's perfect to do the job. the only problems i can find are that the connection between superman and Lois lane isn't very strong and passionate and some of the acting can be kinda stale but this is one roller coaster ride that's sure to blow your mind.",
        "After reading most of the critics reviews on rotten Tomatoes i was very skeptical upon viewing this movie. However all of my doubts went away as soon as i saw this movie and i don't understand why Critics hate this movie. To me it is a very well done well crafted movie with a ton of action pulse a while balanced story to keep the audience entertained throughout. In my opinion this was the superman movie fans like myself were waiting for. Now don't get me wrong it does have its problems but their very minor and easy to look past. Maybe one of the best aspects of this film is the feeling you get after the movie is over as in your not wanting more your not expecting more your satisfied with what you got and to be honest all of Zack Snyder's films are like that. Of course a promising sequel is in the works and well i cant wait to see what they do with this its a great start to maybe a great trilogy.",
        "One of the greatest movies i have ever seen! The visuals in this movie are absolutely incredible. It is clear that a lot of work went into this movie. I honestly don't get why a lot of people had problems with this movie because in my opinion i don't think they could've done it any better. The story is great and the action is phenomenal, but the best part of the movie by far is the visuals! The amount of detail put into every shot of the movie makes it one of the most realistic movies ever made; and its superman. The acting is great and i can see this movie winning many awards. Its worth seeing over and over. It is a must see!!!",
        "I must admit, this was a good movie considering the fact that i'm a DC fan and i have read many of Superman's comics. I was excited about the release of this movie and i thought it was going to be amazing since it was going to be produced by the powerful Christopher Nolan. But i remember that producers only have the task of promoting the film and helping it come out as a visually striking film which it was from my point of view. In conclusion:\n\nIt's a must see since it's Superman but it will never compare to the work of art that is the trilogy of Batman DIRECTED by Christopher Nolan.\n\nThis movie deserves a 7 out of 10.",
        "I only recently watched this movie after having heard some things that didn't sound all that positive but I have to say I was surprised by how good it actually was. It was better than expected, not boring and you can definitely watch it in your downtime. There were a few plotpoints I honestly found stupid but other than that? It was good",
        "I find it difficult to listen/read reviews of movies by people that have no interest in the subject matter or Genre. I had a quick browse through the Metascore reviews and felt disappointed with most of the low scored reviews from people that obviously seemed to have no interest in the 'Superman' franchise.\n\n'Man of Steel' was for me, the beginning of an emotional journey for Kal-El/Clark. It was a story of a young man coming to terms with his abilities and the weight on his shoulders. Henry Cavill/Christopher Nolan/Zack Snyder to an absolutely amazing job to bring the 'Superman' story to the 21st Century.\n\nThe use of Camera shots and the skilled score by Hans Zimmer lifted this movie to a whole new level. We are watching the future of movie making/story telling.",
        "A polarising superman movie that was supposed to be blockbuster and kickstart to DCEU but the thing is that's what happens when you mix oil and water. Or when you give the batman to a comedy campy director. This movie has got the same problems as andrew garfield's TASM. Henry Cavill gives an awesome performance in his character. Honestly if this wasn't a superman movie and if it was either doctor manhattan or Punisher or any other brooding anti hero movie, it could have been the oscar worthy and among the top 100 movies. I wanna give this movie a 6.5/10 but we can't om imbd.",
        "The origins of Superman beautifully told. A Jor-El centered prologue. One of the best soundtracks ever. Cavill embodies the perfect Superman. Every actor gives a magnificent contribution. The story is engaging and deep, everything is explained. The movie has the right tone and it never falters. Deep and with a heart, definitely a big, big movie, especially in light of the best action sequences in a superhero movie and the acting and the story, simply perfect.\n\nThe best possible way to restart this glorious franchise: Man of Steel is a rare case of superhero movie that fully deserves this definition. It brings together all the key elements of the genre. The result is just epic.",
        "You keep wanting it to get going and the engine sparks up but fails to turn on and this happens time and again and after waiting in traffic with a faulty engine for hours you find yourself disappointed turning around to go home. (people actually left the theater).\n\nIt wasn't unbearable, but it was slow with no real story. I can't blame anyone it is just Superman = clark kent, his parents, his alien race, Louis lane, daily planet, 'saving' earth to become a 'hero' - how many times can you tell this story? I keep waiting for the day the superman story can be as dynamic as batman or even spider man. He does have the best powers but unfortunately he is a boring dude.\n\nStandard big budget 3d effects but loads of unnecessary destruction with a non cohesive story; some people laughed at the cheesy moments but others were too bored to even do that.",
        "This movie surprised me a lot. I think this is the best adaptation of Superman. Great actors, specially Antje Traue and Henry Cavill for their perfect performances that reaches amazing levels of acting, amazing action and visual effects, great story and the MOST SPECTACULAR SOUNDTRACK EVER MADE. The soundtrack is extraordinary and spectacular, Hans Zimmer never disappoints his fans. I loved the new theme, I think is perfect for this modern Superman and I know Hans Zimmer will continue to surprises us. I enjoyed this movie even more after seeing it twice. I really loved this movie and I have great expectations for the second one.",
        "Watched it twice, fell asleep through it twice. Henry is quite possibly the worst superman to date. No personality, no charm, just a dull,senseless void. Worst movie ever",
        "Everybody knows when director Nolan makes a film, he makes the movies with another vibe and texture, all his movies feels the same cinematic arctic cool experience in it. Looks frozen cold but in fact it only feel very cool. Very different film maker for such young age",
        "I just saw the movie twice and it keeps getting better. Despite being a story very well known by all, is quite fresh and full of surprises, with great actors and great performances just like any film made it for criterion people, with emotions transmitted to all the audience, making you believe again in films that aren't dummies and full of nonsense action for be a Superhero movie. It makes it honors to Christopher Nolan's work, which I admire so much and all that he write and produce. The directing of Snyder was superb and exceed all my expectations. What else can you ask for this movie ?, maybe only that the saga continue and hope not to wait too much for the second chapter.",
        "The darker more cinematic take by Snyder was refreshing but ultimately did not reach its peak like how Dark Knight revived Batman. The soundtrack is the best bit of this film.",
        "I remember my father taking me to the video rental store as a kid, and the movie i always rented was Superman with Christopher Reeves. I could watch it 3-4 times a month. This version, I would hesitate to sit through again. This movie is not for the causal movie goer or for the ones that remember Superman growing up. It's for the die hard Superman fans, the ones who follow the mythos of superman. From the comic books, to Smallville, to the graphic novels, those who study Superman as a hobby will enjoy it. I happen to love Superman, but the film was way too long even for me. It's almost as if Zack Snyder went into the edit room and said, lets not take anything out. While I appreciate the origin of Superman, it was way too much origin and not enough Superman. The first hour of the film, is like something out of Firefly or Star Trek, not what you expect from Superman. So while it may not be obvious, I did like the film, but I'm disappointed in the direction that the film took. I saw this as a reboot of a franchise that I loved so much as a kid, and instead it's just a stand alone film.",
        "After watching Man of Steel I was already so eager for a sequel. First off, the movie focuses more on Superman's Kryptonian heritage and his relationship with Jor-El. You also get to see Superman's human life and how he struggles to fit in with the rest of the world. Its really cool to see how isolated and secretive he is as a child. Throughout the movie you see that Clark must come out of isolation and face other Kryptonians. Michael Shannon does a great job as General Zod and he portrays him just like in the comics (which is a good thing). Also you see Amy Adams as Lois Lane and in this movie is very \"agressive\". She'll get right to the point and is very adventurous. A different but likable Lois Lane from the comics. The CGI was great and the battles are just like you would expect them between Superman and Zod. Overall, the film was amazing and I cant wait to see what they do in expanding the story (World's Finest, hint, hint.)",
        "its movie is great the action is of the chain,story has been told before but because this is a new superman it isn't boarding, yes that's right people this isn't the comic book superman its a great new version other wise it wouldn't be a reboot my friends. OK the action is so good, the small vile part its self is worth the ticket price its self. even tho the destroying of building's does get the same after a while the pro's do out way the cons. krypton also looks amazing, for the first 15-20 minutes you see what happens to the home planet of Krypton, the planet looks amazing with war and the whole planet breaking down. overall this film has amazing action,story line and characters.\n\nnot be to missed",
        "The only positive I can say is that it was well acted. Ben made a great Batman. BVS was just garbage, dreary for dreary's sake. The was nothing to care about in the film. No humor, nothing that made you care in any way about what happened when the two fought, let alone the outcome. Poor writing and directing was the most memorable features of this film. I was very excited for this movie, but this pile of monkey feces was a far cry from anything resembling good film making. DC really dropped the ball, the Batman franchise was done so well, and to drop this turd on fans is an insult. Skip this, if you feel you have to see it then just wait till is is free somewhere, otherwise you will just feel ripped off like I do.",
        "This was a very good movie but didn't make sense logically. Where were all the other Superheroes during an extinction level threat??",
        "Earlier today I watched Man of Steel with extremely high standards, expecting it to be my new favorite movie. Although it isn't my new favorite movie (it's my second favorite movie) it was still amazing. The emotion conveyed by the actors was astonishing, there wasn't that much humor but I did giggle at certain scenes. I felt the beginning of the movie was a bit too fast-paced and I would have loved to see it paced at a decreased speed in exchange for another half hour of the movie. The action was amazing, the flying looked realistic, Henry Cavill did wonders as Superman but who really took the spot light was Russel Crowe as Jor-El. Jor-El was easily my favorite character in the movie with Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman as a close second. The soundtrack was surprisingly great. It's a great movie. 9.7/10. 0.3 points off just because of certain aspects I disliked such as the fast pace at the beginning and the ending of the final battle felt anti-climactic.",
        "The Men of Steel a great story \"How to be GOD on the EArth\". I loved Henry Cavil, when he wear the iconic Superman suit and he flew with it. The Visual was amazing but the story was dumb and Commender Zod better than in MCU protagonist i didnt have problem with him.",
        "Superman , literally from the Comics and Bud Collier cartoons through the George Reeves and Christopher Reeve incarnations always had a smile or at least smirk along the line . This version decided (as much of Hollywood is sold on) amp up the sound and fury and the public (which all are assumed to be , I would say 12 year olds , but then that would be insulting 12 year olds) will eat it up , sadly it works too often financially . I expected nothing , figuring a new take is a new take . Instead I got an overblown \"Superman II\" ; except without , as I say , the traditional element of fun . On top of that some of the scenes were eerily out of 9/11 . There were good actors giving good performances , and style and effects with the best , but after nearly 2 1/2 hrs one is left with not much , except a hope if they keep on going down this line the stories get better and the effects more occasional so there is an actual special \"effect\" not just a fireworks show which on screen isn't as good as in person .",
        "Man of steel will disappoint you. I though to my self, finally a darker, longer and amazing superman film, but this is not the case. The film jumps from scene to scene way to fast and it seems like they have just forgot to put in a lot of the important stuff. The beginning of the film is really cool, and Russel Crowe plays his role really well but after that you are just waiting for the film to get good and that never happens. I really love superhero movies but this is not worth the money. I believe the film will be super cool for kids around the age of 11 - 12 because of all the action and \"cool\" scenes but for those that look at the acting, the plot and history you should not see it. I will give it a \"3\" for nice effects and Russel Crowe but thats it. I am sad to say that history have repeated itself and again someone tried to make a good superman film but it all went down in flames.",
        "This is definitely a must see film!!!!!! Do yourself a favor and ignore the mainstream reviews: I TOTALLY agree with Bill \"Jett\" Ramey: \"Don't let the negative MOS reviews bother or keep you from going to see it. Quite frankly, most of the bad reviews are from mainstream \"uppity\" film critics who 1) Don't like Zack Snyder, 2) Have an agenda against Chris Nolan because he was their \"indie darling\" who had the nerve to make Batman films, and 3) they still do not respect superhero cinema and fans of the genre. Sadly, I thought 'THE DARK KNIGHT' changed all that, but it hasn't. It seems if a comic book film is \"serious\" and isn't popcorn fluff, then it \"sucks.\" I couldn't have said it better myself...so I didn't, and quoted him!",
        "First time since Avatar 3-D makes sense. Home planet of Superman as it showed in the movie is absolutely perfect - visually is equal to Pandora, and philosophically even better. It worth just to see it in first 20 minutes of the movie. Great style in details and absolutely logically portrayed alien world. For the second time in my life ( after Avatar's Pandora) I saw alien world that is believable and solid. I'm not a comic book fan at all, but I will recommend this movie to anyone.Plus a great homage to Kevin Costner. His character makes you think who is the real superman. One minus for is far too much destruction on the Earth during fighting but, well, some people like that and lets face it, how else Superman can fight?",
        "My first impressions from the trailers were not what I hoped for in the next installment of Superman, after watching it I was pleasantly surprised how well it was done although its a geneses re-make, probably the best to date, all the characters were spot on with acting, looking forward to more, my favorite Superman is still Christopher Reeves in Superman 1 and 2, but this is a great new generation start for all the kids to see with it being like two movies in one combining what was originally done in two movies long ago, Henry Cavill has a great look for the role as Superman except I am not so sure about the Clark Kent image, Christopher Reeves was spot on the way he transformed his image from one to the other, anyway you cannot miss this movie as its definitely full of entertainment for the whole family.",
        "With Christopher Nolan attached to the project you might expect a more subtle and down to earth approach to a superhero movie (Dark Knight trilogy), but Man of Steel is everything but subtle. as it turn out it is nothing more than just another superhero/popcorn movie the family will enjoy. It lacks character, emotional, and intellectual building that makes a great movie in our time. The writing is just as predictable as the plot itself. It's one of those movies you will check your watch and think \"when it is going to end?\". The CGI and superman's muscles are great no doubt, but I believe we are not here for CGI and definitely not muscles. The trailer lead us to believe that it is going to be a great reboot such as Dark knight but it is just not.",
        "To be honset I don't know what I expected from Zack Synder. I thought the cast was very well put together but in the end it was poorly executed.\n\nYes I understand that this movie was built for actual fans of the comic series but do us all a favor and explain a couple of things before taking off on a wild Superman tangent. Please take 2 mins to let us into the story and explore the beginnings of Superman with you. Instead you started off without most of the audience and expected us to catch up or enjoy the movie without proper info. Next time give Nolan more control and keep Synder out of the picture completely.",
        "The first half starts off really well - a fun (Star Wars-esq) opening set on Krypton followed by the pre-requisite scenes of a young Clark Kent going through growing pains (all via flashback). Henry Cavill looks the part and is a decent Supes - yeah, I was really enjoying this. Then, the last hour becomes so overblown and bombastic its as if Snyder swapped the Director's chair with Michael Bay! The action quickly becomes monotonous and boring as Superman battles the baddies through ENDLESS destruction of buildings and the same plot as Transformers 3. The film doesn't give itself a chance to breathe - smash smash SMASSHHHH! Going for a \"realistic\" serious tone about an alien who wears a cape is always going to be tricky and the film suffers for this too. Batman works, as he's basically just a guy - but here, well, the juxtaposition of realism and fantasy just doesn't quite sit right. Superman is a hard hero to crack. Still, there is enough entertainment here for a bit of fun - just don't expect it be as super as it thinks it is.",
        "The Man of Steel\ufeff was a great film. It is a reboot of Superman through the eyes of Zack Snyder, taking him into the modern times where wearing red underwear on top is frowned upon. I am a huge fan of Snyder after he perfectly brought one of my favorite graphic novels, Watchmen, to life in perfect clarity. So does he deliver? I would say YES\n\nThe movie is a big hitter with all manner of high production values, great actors you would expect from a AAA blockbuster.Despite similar circumstances, the movie showed clear contrast from Marvel's 'All flash, zero substance' with DC Comics\ufeff's focus on storytelling, bond between the characters while keeping the action on the background. All which makes you connect and care for the action on screen instead of just letting it all blast past your eyes.\n\nMy rating for Man of Steel: 8.5/10",
        "Every superhero comes with a point of origin, which not only helps the audience to root for the character, it also helps them to identify with the human in him. Now, in the modern world of ever increasing weight of special effects boosted by limitless budget, the makers have the freedom to choose what aspect of the hero they want to portray. Here, as soon as mandatory subjects like origin and journey are hurriedly covered, we are thrown into what Superman can actually do, and the makers start breathing easy. This film becomes an excellent example of not only how Superman saves the Earth, but also how effects take the place of coherent storytelling of human emotions, and can still come out as a movie. Its ironic how the one thing that Superman fights for is actually missing, the human beings. The one thing I actually miss about the Superman of simpler times is simplicity.",
        "Henry Cavill and Amy Adams do a fantastic job as portraying the familiar Superman. It was a great story, the tear jerker scenes were amazing, the movie had great action and a fantastic cast. My only complaint would be that it was a bit too long at the very end and the fight scene seemed to drag on a bit. I assume if people from out of this world were fighting and had super powers it would be something as it was, but for me, just a bit too drawn out. Henry is stunning and Russell Crow just as handsome :) Def. go see this movie. Im not sure i can see it again, but glad i saw it once. Cant wait to see the follow up on this movie.",
        "Man of Steel was a great, well-directed Superman origin story, with fantastically creative action sequences, yet I cannot seem to ignore the large lack of character development.\n\nWhile I understand that Superman is widely known and understood, David Goyer fails to develop Superman into a superhero the audience can actually care about. The dialogue and writing, at times, feels shallow and inconsistent. Not to mention, that some character's intensity and lack of humor or light heartedness was distracting and felt out of place.\n\nBottom Line: I am giving it a weak 8/10. Man of Steel is a impressive movie that will hopefully launch a bigger DC universe into existence. Individually, I really want to like Man of Steel and somewhere between the satisfying plot, the intense action, and the satisfaction of Superman done right, the positives outweigh the negatives.",
        "To be honest, I was really hyped for this movie and then it started getting some bad critic reviews, so I started to worry. Luckily though people seemed to like it so I jumped back up on the hype wagon and I finally watched the film.....loved it! I am a huge fan of anything that has to do with superheroes, whether it be DC or Marvel. Everything about this movie is great! From the deep and emotional story right down to the super special effects. Zack Snyder did a fantastic job. One thing that stood out the most for me was the acting. Cavill did an amazing job as Cal-El/Clark/Superman(that's what they're calling him). Costner and Crowe were also great. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with an apatite for some action, and trust me there is no shortage of action in this one. Go see it! Now!",
        "I can NOT believe this movie is rated 8+ on IMDb. Until it dawned on me that MOST of the reviews were all made prior to the June 14th release date. I know there are people who get paid to write comments and rate things that they haven't even seen or used. It's a new age marketing tactic, and it got me with this movie. Who in their right mind would rate this poor excuse of a Superman movie a 10 is beyond me!!\n\nIf your looking to drop you hard earned coin on this, go ahead, but read the reviews AFTER June 14th. You can a better scope of the REAL reviews of the movie.\n\nDon't say you weren't warned...",
        "...i like superhero movies. There are good ones, there are bad ones. This one falls the furthest on the negative spectrum. It's terrible, enough said. Most have been commented from other reviewers and I don't want to repeat them. I'm not sure how DC will be able to move on with its \"Batman vs Superman\" shindig and a Wonder Woman appearance was mentioned as well with some actors/actresses already confirmed. But then again, this is Hollywood, I am sure they are going to re-cycle some thrown-out script and polish them up again. This \"MoS\" movie left a bad taste and I intend to wash it off with some Marvel movies just to get back to neutral. Between the movie and animated movies, I'd take the animations any day than this piece of embarrassment. Even the animated movies scripts were well-written. Final thought, \"MoS\" feels like Capt. Kirk yelling out \"KHHAANN !!!\"...damn, i need coffee...",
        "I saw this movie first day first show, I am not sure whether I understood the real meaning of the film. Good: Special effects. Bad: Hypersonic. I forced to cancel my Sunday show because of supersonic effort.Director explained the effect of sound and light but not much about the super hero . According to me ,super heroes are not for action only. And I don't think so this will entertain kids. I could say it is good in technical aspect. But cinema is not only meant for sound and light.I saw the same feeling in all the faces in the cinema hall like me. Sorry if this words are not sweet. I will see the movie again this week for better understanding.",
        "If you're looking for action, explosion, eye popping special effect, you get it all here. Whatever you see in trailer, multiply it by 2 to 3 times.\n\nHowever, I find that I keep on questioning the script. It does not have satisfying reason for certain things to happen.\n\nIf you're expecting Batman Begin feel, I think it's quite underwhelmed. They tried but I don't it works for Superman, at least not in this movie.\n\nOverall, it's decent. Worth your dollar. But please do not have high expectation on the storyline. But on the action, i think you will get what you expect.",
        "This movie redefines what it means to be Superman, while maintaining the core values and traditions that have made Kal-El an American hero and icon.\n\nSnyder masterfully captures the struggle that Millennials have in identity and purpose in Clark Kent, giving him a human element modern Americans can relate to, at the same time conveying the near omnipotence of Superman in beautifully captured battles. The images reviewers see, in conjunction with Zimmer's score, highlight the aforementioned struggles Kal-El experiences.\n\nThis film also has power in the religious allegory of the Superman mythos, portraying Superman as a benign Messiah willing to scarface everything for his adopted world.\n\nYou will believe a man can fly.",
        "I believe this franchise has potential, bold statement, I know. I don't doubt financially it will succeed, I surmise from a quality standpoint, and it's an immense improvement over the last reboot effort, Superman Returns. With the combination of director Zack Snyder, screenwriter David Goyer, and the man in the tights Henry Cavill, Superman possess a stronger connection with the average human, something I felt lacked with past depictions.\n\nHowever, a cardinal critique of mine is that the plot is messy and underdeveloped. Plus, I deem Faora was a more compelling villain than General Zod, and that pains me to confess because I'm such a great admirer of Michael Shannon.",
        "From my childhood, every time I asked myself why we depend on some fiction, ineffectual and clich\u00e9 superheroes. They are only exaggerated characters that never belonged to our manual lives. They recoiled usually when faced to big problem rely on their supernatural, meaningless powers. Until I watched first episode of \"Dark knight\" trilogy. Dark knight shows that finally superheroes want to come to our mundane life! And who don't know we owe it to Christopher Nolan. Man of steel is in the course of reborn procedure of old human-remote superheroes to make them closer. The intellectual legacy that Nolan built it in Dark knight episodes (and terminate it at last one!) now makes happen for Superman. It's admirable when we hear only twice \"Superman\" name during the movie that make us construe: just like Dark knight was a phoenix uprising from Batman's ash; Man of steel does same role for Superman character. I saw Nolan's spirit in every minutes of Man of steel. I appreciate it and admit it that I'm very excited to follow Nolan's intellectual way in the future.",
        "After watching 300 & Watchmen for like 100 times, \"I BELIEVE IN SNYDER!\" This was my wordings when I just walked inside the movie hall & As usual Zack Snyder did it again. Man of Steel deserves a 10/10. As promised, You may not have seen such type of Visual FX in any other movies. Man of Steel leaves Iron Man 3 & Avengers behind in every way. They definitely\ufeff delivered on the story, characters and action. They finally got it right. This is the best Superman movie by far. Best movie of the summer, thus far. It\ufeff is awesome! Man of Steel reboot is SUPER AWESOME. I really liked the part where he saves his\ufeff mom. Thanks for putting that in Zack! You're really awesome.\n\nHans Zimmer - You're the man. The original soundtrack is legendary. Can't stop listening to them.",
        "Critics and fans out there don't judge this incarnation of superman basing on the past movies or series. This is a brand new superman all together. Its a fresh start totally brand new and cannot be compared to the past movies or series. Just like it happened to Spiderman. I just got home from watching the special Wal-Mart screening presentation and to me this movie was a mayor original hit. Totally awesome. What I like best besides the story, the special effects and the music was that it is a brand new stand alone version not based on anything we ever seen before. It kept me wondering thru every scene what was going to happen next rather than predicting. People when you all go to see it tomorrow or whenever don't go thinking or nerveless compare it to the past movies or series cause it will ruined your whole movie experience. Just go expecting to see something brand new and fresh from the start. like you never seen a superman movie or series before. Totally awesome movie indeed!",
        "Best Superman movie ever, great usage of GFX, Hi-Tech, good cast, wonderful story line and yet interesting move in editing and BMG... Q: Why is always a god gifted child from other planet travels to earth and grows up only in America doesn't he find Singpore or Abudhabi a good place to spend time or is it otherwise ? is what millions of people including including myself think ! and one other important point , in most of the flick super hero's father are either Mechanic or does fix some car at least in a scene and this is no exceptional ! Henry Cavill looks awesome and girls will obviously like him like a hot piece like a chicken sizzler... This flick should be added as \"do not miss flick\" for making people believe that Super Man is just not another human who wears inner wear on top of trousers. I am sure this superman flick will become a franchise and we can await for sequel in few yrs !! 8/10 for Zack Snyder for revealing the meaning of \"S\"",
        "I'm probably showing my age, but having grown up with Superman. Thought that visually it was great and the casting was good. However for me Christopher Reeve will always be the benchmark for Superman and this was too big a departure for me. Their lacked the warmth and fun of the previous films. It seems at the moment films want to make comic book films dark and where as this suits characters like Batman, I don't feel it suits Superman. I liked the bumbling of Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent and then the switch to a confident Superman. If anything it made his disguise more believable. If you haven't seen this film watch the 1978 version if you have then give the 1978 version a chance.",
        "Henry is a gorgeous man as ever and is a brilliant actor too. However, there was way too much SFX, or more precisely, the SFX was a bit obvious in my opinion. All I remember from the fighting scenes was things flying everywhere, explosions, etc.. It was a bit of a blur. There was not enough real fight between the villains and Superman. (Superman did not even spit blood!) This is rather disappointing especially when Henry was the superman this time...\n\nSince there were not enough fighting scenes, those SFX and spaceships made the whole film looked like an E.T. film. I went to watch Man of Steel because I want to see Superman/Henry. I am not an E.T. fan.\n\nIf the fighting scenes were more exciting and more breath-taking, then I would definitely give 10 out of 10.",
        "The first half had the nice character development and an awesome Superman story. The second half was a 1 hour long fight scene that ended in Superman snapping his neck. Zack snyder needs to learn to cut down the fighting scenes.",
        "While Darknight or Constantine proved otherwise, this title shows throwing in a number of stars like Crowe, etc wouldn't make a superhero film complex enough for adults. This one's for kids. The cast are good but some performances are just nuts; the scientist lady in her first encounter with an alien spaceship and live machinery for the, apparently, first time in human history shows anything other than awe. The underlying emotions are told in cuts and pieces and you can't relate to them. And a number of other, well, flaws, or simplicities make this film only suitable for a lazy afternoon when you don't have anything better to do.",
        "Man of Steel had not one but many villains. The majority consisted of the frenzied mob which had flogged the theatres to catch the fourth film of the Dark Knight trilogy. But even after getting to know that the trilogy can mean only three films, they failed to move on and like spurned lovers went mad and threw venom on the film itself.\n\nNot that the film was entirely flawless. Some more character development and less action would have done it a world of good but the sad part is that most of the criticisms are arising from totally irrational grounds which is unfair to the makers of the film who just cannot make Superman to fear the bats.\n\nJust thought to make grounds even.",
        "this made me love superman, since superman returns I noticed I was not into superman, when man of steel came out, I was planning in not even seeing it. honestly though I'm glad I did. it had a good story, lots of action and a very goose bump effect climax, not to mention the final battle scene between Zod and superman was pretty epic, as was every battle scene. only complaint would have to be the character of Lois lane. I found her quite annoying and honestly could care less about her character. other than that though it was a great superhero movie. I really enjoyed it and I would recommend this movie to any DC fans out there.",
        "The Man of Steel : a film based on the comic book that sold more than all time , showing once again the source of Kal -El, in the Krypton world and , for the first time showing the Man of Steel more Human seen so far, with a highly entertaining story was preparing for the Superman we will see , it is a film full of action , destruction and an incredible soundtrack that gives heart to the film, with a large casting and perfect actors , if it is true that need a little more development in some characters, but still an epic start to the ' Extended Dc Universe ' ' and one of the best action movies in my opinion.",
        "This film had been building up so many peoples hopes for a long time that by the time it came out people were expecting the greatest superhero movie ever. So when it came out and didn't turn out excellent, people started hating on it. This film is not as bad as people put it out to be but it's not great either. Cavill is OK but seems to be focusing too much on perfecting his American accent and forgetting to act aswel but is by far the best choice for the character. The casting seems perfect at first until you watch it and discover that most of the cast is just plane and bland. Zack Snyder and David Goyer is the main problem. This film is enjoyable and Michael Shannon is great. (!SPOILERS!) I also didn't mind at all about the controversial scene when Superman breaks Zod's neck. Overall a 65%",
        "Directors, please take note: Long mindless sequences of ridiculously over-the-top CGI violence/destruction are BORRIINNG!\n\nI've been a Superman fan since I was young child, so I'm not happy about giving Man of Steel one star. But that's all it deserves. Unfortunately for the talented cast, the material is simply awful in every way. Inane dialog. Inane plot devices. Inane action.\n\nI had especially high hopes for this movie, because Snyder's Watchmen is a masterpiece: visually stunning and cerebral. Unfortunately, Snyder didn't bring any of that to Man of Steel.\n\nI think I'm done paying to see blockbuster action movies until directors remember how to TELL GOOD STORIES.",
        "When I went to see this I was hoping that this would be a good reboot, but sadly I was disappointed. I did like some of the references that they placed in (like the brief showing of a Lexcorp truck) as well as the prologue of Krypton, who's society and culture remained a mystery up until now. Also there were a few adjustments to the original Superman films that I did like, one of which was fixing his costume which was just plain ridiculous. What I didn't like is how little plot there was. Pretty much the whole movie was fighting, which is good if the movie is short like Taken, but for a movie about two hours long, it's not the best. It also could have been better if they featured a villain that was introduced in the comics but not the second movie, Superman II, but seeing as they wanted to make this more realistic, I can see why they picked General Zod. Overall though, the movie was a disappointment, and I feel they could've done better.",
        "Even Snyder's film is full of epic action, adventure and fantasy. I think the actors who played the father (Russell Crowe)and the step-father (Kevin Costner) were excellent for the roles. And the man him self (Henry Cavill) I believe was great as the man of steel he fitted the part perfectly. And I guess I can see why the critics complained about too much action, superman being too serious and lack of romance because it did a bit but this film was truly a great action film and The visuals in the film were spectacular! And what's best about this film is its action scenes. The action were just relentless. I think the fans would not be disappointed with this film at all.",
        "Best of all previous \"Superman\" Movies\" but still falls really short of a movie with a reasonable plot. The director very clearly compensated for all shortcomings in the plot by adding loads of unnecessary special effects. Some of which were great, but went for too long. In doing so, the love story between Clark and Lane, felt like it came from nowhere and it had no merits. Clark's life as a child also didn't mean a thing in building the story. Killing the villain the way it was done in this movie was not well thought off. Super-Aliens with Super Powers, don't simply get tired half way through a battle and lose their power to fight. The acting was not good.Other than the big names in this movie, the acting of the three main characters was in many places \"cold' and just horrible. I like Superheros movies, but for some reason, no one is able to make a good \"Superman\" movie.",
        "From beginning to end, Man of Steel is truly a spectacular movie! I have already watched the film 4 times, and each time I end up appreciating it more.\n\nMan of Steel is an epic origin story, filled with fantastic music and an interesting and logical story.\n\nThe fight scenes in the movie are the best I've ever seen, and the movie-making quality far surpasses many other superhero movies. Superman is the most powerful being on the planet, and he is portrayed as such.\n\nFor anyone who hasn't watched it yet, I say this: If you miss Man of Steel, then you miss one of the greatest movies of the year. Watch it!",
        "I was always a big fan of Superman when I was a kid. The only thing that bothered me was they were overly cheezy and the acting was so-so. Heard from my brother that snyder took the directors seat in this latest installment and I was exited. My favorite Superman from the past was number two, where he fought the three kryptonians, so this movie looked pretty good. My brother picked me up and we went to see it on a Saturday when the theaters were not so packed. When the lights went out and the movie started rolling I found myself still not expecting too much. Half an hour in and I was hooked! The acting was superb and the action was just awesome. They could have done a little more with amy adams, she seemed a little detached. That being said this Superman was a blast! To many people have problems with movies today. Instead of seeing anything good they just love to complain. You want to see a movie worth complaining about?...try iron man 3.",
        "Just an attempt by Zack Snyder to reboot an old movie.. even though MAN OF STEEL had glorious effects, mediocre script is a set back..\n\nStarting from the first scene it manages to attract the audience,, but fails to keep it till the end.. In acting category everybody has done their best. Henry Cavill has done a good macho Superman, Michael Shannon is perfect.Amy Adams, Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner did a great job in their small roles. When it comes to visual effects, it probably beats THE AVENGERS.. It has an excellent background score,, Hans Zimmer has done it again.. But because of old and less attractive script it fails.. What they have done is good, but the only thing is 'it could have done better'.. With Nolan's production the expectations were very high.. It fails to manage the hype.. But in the end may be \"THIS IS THE BEST REBOOT POSSIBLE\" Still it is a good popcorn blockbuster.. 6.5/10",
        "It was good. I really liked it. It was better than Superman 3, 4 and returns. Because they were rubbish. Henry Cavill was great as Superman; he was up there with Christopher Reeves and Tom Welling. I love how they put the sci-fi genre in it; it added...space and stuff. Russel Crowe was great; better than Marlon Brando; 'cause he had more to do. Amy Adams was hot....Yeah. And Zack Snyder directing gave something new to Superman; he gave it new life, resurrected the super hero genre for a new age. Michael Shannon was great...erm; brang something new, nothing like Terence Stamp; but got the job done. The special effects were out of this world; 'cause it was a Sci-Fi.",
        "Plot was close to well made. I wish this movie had more memorable and exciting moments.\n\nAction sequences were unique and great, but for some parts, little bit tired.\n\nOverall, it was quiet enjoyable, wachable movie.",
        "I admit as far as being a brilliant plot and well directed story line it may have lacked for what i feel Zack Snyder is capable of especially with the aid of Christopher Nolan. But I do feel that their was a lot to cover in a recreation of a legend and I think that he did a good job displaying what needed to be seen to keep it true to the original Superman but appeal to the new generation, as well as humanize such a god like character so that people can attempt to relate to him as much as possible. I don't think in anyway this movie was a fail but it was a needed intro such as \"Captain America First Avenger\" which was followed by the success of \"The Winter Soldier\".",
        "It's a shame to call this a Superman movie. I am sure Christopher Reeve (bless his soul) would have cringed if he ever saw this movie. What happened to the secret identity of Superman? He might as well work for the Daily Planet wearing his cape!\n\nLooks like Superman gets his powers from CGI! The guy who wrote the script was either having a writer's block or had smoked up by the time he finished it. Superman Returns was any day better than this.\n\nAlso the guy who plays Superman....who is he??? Next they might consider Ben Affleck to play Superman. Hey he is supposed to play Batman right, what the heck? Why not Superman as well?",
        "I was pretty excited to watch this when it came out as I've always been a fan of the first 2 Superman movies, Richard Donner's cuts with Brando. The rest is awful.\n\nSnyder has taken everything that made Superman relatable and funny (Clark) and given us this hybrid between Superman's origen (the best part) and a horrendous video game like final act that completely ruined it for me.",
        "Despite Christopher Nolan's involvement, Zach Snyder fails to produce a film as interesting or intellectual as any of Batman's recent outings.\n\n'Man of Steel' seemed dull and at times boring. Even the large CGI action sequences can't save this film from being one of the worst super hero movies to date. Henry Cavills portrayal of superman isn't terrible and he is somewhat likable, but in no way memorable.\n\nMan of steel fails to live up to its hype. If your a casual movie-goer and easily entertained by any blockbuster containing large CGI fight scenes, as many people are these days, this film may suffice, anybody else should steer clear.",
        "Imagine dining at a world famous restaurant. The food looks beautiful, the chef is a culinary genius and the restaurant's reputation is second to none.\n\nYour chosen dish is a work of art, every aspect has been thought out thoroughly and each element works together perfectly.\n\nThe dish is bland. You can't quite put your finger on the reason, it's just bland. Parts of the dish are full of flavour, overall though it tastes of nothing.\n\nIf I knew what was missing from Man of Steel, I'd be working within the film industry. I'm not and I don't.\n\nWould I watch it again? I would. It's not a bad film by any means, it just feels empty.",
        "So finally I watched 'Man of Steel' yesterday. The ending was not up to my expectation, there were a lot of destruction and blasts and lacked emotion in the end which kinda makes it forgettable. It was nowhere near Dark Knight Rises or even Batman Begins. Yeah it was an alien movie and alien on earth there had to be a lot of explosions but it certainly did missed the emotional aspect. But it defo a new launch for the best superhero, as the previous Superman movies sucked...so if there's a sequel to be made then am waiting, maybe this is just the starting and launch pad for the sequels and no surprise if this happens to be another great trilogy like Batman series (of Nolan). And yeah Henry Cavill wasn't that good... . My rating is 7.5 but since IMDb doesn't has .5 more so giving it a 8",
        "Lots of supportive viewer reviews. Not mine. I found this to be an endless ride and utterly unsatisfying. Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Tarzan even Sherlock Holmes; were all heros of my childhood. Hero's because they were virtuous, not because of a capacity for havoc. This film was epically boring, repetitive, and mono dimensional. Dialogue often seemed strained, like it was hard for the actors to stand behind. I kept watching, hoping for the moment when it would reveal greater depth, when it would move to another level which would reframe everything and win my empathy or support. Nope..",
        "Finally, a director who gets 'adaptation'. Zack Snyder is a 'superhero' story telling genius, using every scene to tell a complex story without boring audiences with what we already know about Superman. Great costumes, superb casting, mesmerizing acting, edge of seat action sequences, convincing CGI, and award winning directing. And he did it all without a Lex Luther plot. Bravo! I'm looking forward to the Wonder Woman, and Justice League movies, and it would be a travesty not to keep Zack Snyder at the helm. Zack Snyder is a director who clearly understands superheroes and the fans who love them. I would really like to see Zack Snyder's, or even Joss Whedon's interpretation of X-Men. The existing directors and writers of the X-Men franchise have failed miserably.",
        "Man of Steel turns out to be a complete entertainer, outclasses all the other movies this year. First half is the story build up done beautifully by Zack Snyder. The second half is full of Steel. By far the best Superman movie ever seen. Hats off to Christopher Nolan for pulling this one off once again..\n\nSuperman is by far the most tolerant and powerful of all characters and this movie is a perfect start to the saga. Waiting for more. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE IN 3D. NOT MADE FOR 2D.\n\nWhat is best is the character revelations in this movie. Superman is much more than just power. He is the most patient of all.",
        "As the movie starts you think, \"Oh now we'll have to go through Clark Kent being born and his flashback all over again\". But as the movie progresses, you realize that the story is no longer predictable. The visuals in the movie are amazing and the scenes in Krypton are brilliantly shot. Clark Kent's journey as an alien on earth are sequenced well and the viewer can pretty much connect with it. There is a good continuity in the story and it has been written very well. The action sequences are a bit lame and can be a bit of a drab with the 3D. Despite that, the plot deviating from the commonplace Superman movie makes it stand out. The way that the alien turns down his own people to fight for humans is shown in a fascinating manner. Henry Cavell and Amy Adams have done their roles well. Hans Zimmerman, I needn't mention at all. And to top it off, Nolan has a part to play in it. One can't ask for a better superhero movie.",
        "I didn't have that big expectations but I had expected the plot to be a lot more developed. The characters fell flat and they lacked chemistry which made all of the interactions feel empty. None of the scenes actually moved me and the second half of the movie was a fight scene. I understand that this movie was supposed to have a more \"dark\" ring to it but I personally thought it lacked depth. At the same time the movie had a lot of plot holes which made the movie feel stupid. It was hard to apply logic to some events which made it hard to take serious. Personally I thought they could have made this movie a lot better but that's just my opnion. The only feelings I felt was boredom and annoyance during this film.",
        "I went into this film knowing as much as one could know from watching the Saturday morning cartoons and The New Adventures of Lois and Clark plus some of the 50s cartoon. I have to say that I greatly enjoyed myself with this film. An interesting twist on what is normally done with the story. Without giving away too much, what I'll say is this...I think someone has to go into this without thoughts of what can be found in the comics and previous movies/shows. Without these preconceived notions on what the story SHOULD be, one can greatly enjoy this rendition of the story of the babe from Krypton. Yes, I do agree that there are parts that the major fan-boys will cry out in disgust because it doesn't follow canon. But take it for what it is. A new telling of a classic tale. Bring your young children that do not know much about Superman and the young child within you and enjoy one of the greatest tellings of this story.",
        "I don't usually take the time to rate or review movies, but this one felt necessary. Man of Steel deserves to be ranked with some of the best movies in history. This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen, in all regards. The storyline goes above and beyond in ways other movies can't even begin to. Superman is finally made into a believable, realistic individual. Man of Steel completely shreds all of the unrealistic fantasies of a god-like infallible, which in my opinion is necessary considering Kryton's less-than-perfect civilization. It goes above and beyond in detail-work with tiny details adding up to serve an ENORMOUS understanding. The plot serves to answer all questions of how, why, and when to an unprecedented extent in cinema. The background story is equally balanced with full-scale action cinema, as the antagonism ties into Superman's origins. And what could tie it all together better than one of the best casts I've ever seen? An exceptional first movie in a reboot. This movie has clearly set one of the best foundations for a saga that could go on as long and far as filmmakers could dare to dream of.",
        "It's true that there were some issues with it not being a true origin story. But I can easily say that it's my new favorite superhero movie. If you haven't already seen it you need to drop what you're doing and go see it. The action was more intense than anything I've ever seen, but at the same time wasn't overly graphic. It maintains Superman's code to be the hero who always tries to find the best in people and only fights to save the lives of innocent people. Each location was beautiful, and the CG was so well blended that it's easy to suspend belief. It's also the perfect film for Superman fans because there are a great many easter eggs spread throughout the movie. 10/10 Great movie.",
        "I'm not going to go into great detail here and yes, I know there are a lot of haters out there who aren't happy but all I'll say is this. Don't go to the movie expecting to see Superman, you'll be seeing a young Clark Kent trying to find his way on a journey of discovery. He's may be genetically Kryptonion but he was raised by humans and he is a human and he'll slip, and he'll fall just like we would but in the end, he will save mankind at all costs.\n\nI look forward to seeing the Character develop in the sequel, the way it ended with him dawning the nerdy glasses was evidence that this is just the beginning and there is a whole Journey that we will share with Cavill's portrayal of Superman.",
        "Only psychopaths are able to write a script like this or watch this movie and feel good about it. Good is bad and bad is good.",
        "Amazing movie! I've been a fan of superman since the late great Christopher Reeves soared through the skies in the late 70s. It didn't have all the spectacular movie effects, such as 3D, green screen, and CGI, but the cinematography was great and it worked for the audience at that time. And that's what I enjoyed about this rebooted Superman. The director and his team of producers made a movie that captured the audience's attention (Action!). Yes we all know the story behind Superman, but I liked that they dug a little deeper into Superman's Kyrptonian past. Gave it a rough edge and more darker look into the once great but foolish Alien race. Yea the critics cried...what did they expect? Superman from the 50s era?! Hello?? This a remake...a reboot...something new and perhaps different?!! I know everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I for one will say Man of Steel was Superb!",
        "from the release of the trailer,i was really very excited n was eagerly waiting for d movie(having known that d director is zack snyder who made 300),but was utterly shocked by what he has done..really it was one of the worst movie experiences.visual effects have been overly done. also worst screenplay n stunts added to the weak plot. couldn't they find anyone better to cast for the heroine role? if some thing is good about d movie,its the henry cavil,and hans zimmer.. otherwise,the movie is a great disappointment to the super hero lovers. its not at all what u expect from ZackSnyder n christopher nolan..if u want to enjoy the weekend,safely stay away from it",
        "Superman...from reading the other reviews, i was expecting some beautiful action scenes, a really hot Superman, and a new vision of the aging myth.\n\nWell. I was quite disappointed. OK, the main actor is hot. OK, the action scenes are good, well filmed, good special effects. But apart from that, it's just 2 hours of a very boring movie, with no fun, no jokes, a very nice (too nice??) guy wearing a blue suit and trying to save whoever's standing next to him and is in danger.\n\nThere is so many other superhero blockbusters that have much more complexity to their main characters (Batman, Spiderman), more fun (Avengers, Iron Man), better story line, so please don't loose your time on this one.",
        "I personally loved the film. For starters too many people compare the previous films to this one, it will obviously lack some qualities, but overall the big changes and redesign of the concept of superman is necessary. It is intense, strong powerful story which gives you a view on the journey he takes to become the man of steel. Problems people might face if they wanna make a comparison are: Criticisms: - too serious - too much action - new Lois Lane (she was good in my opinion just a bit cold) - Few issues but nothing major Other than that the film was perfect for me, aside from hardly any humour Its a really really good superman film worth watching, Zack Snyder did justice.",
        "Do not listen to Critics in regards to this film, it is a good superhero film and by far Zack Snyder's best movie yet. It takes a more Sci-Fi look at the Superman story and it works for the better. The story is genuinely interesting and the CGI is top notch, along with the sweet action scenes. I don't understand why this is being throttled by a lot of people it really is already a very underrated film. The acting is very good from Superman, Lois Lane, to Pa and Ma Kent to whoever Laurence Fishburne was playing. Go and see it if you have any interest in superheroes, science fiction and people being punched through buildings. And if anybody tells you this movie's bad, that's okay, because you know they're just being swept up in a tide of unnecessary internet rage. Hopefully you will be able to appreciate this great Sci-Fi adventure from Zack Snyder, if not, well there are plenty of other movies to look forward to this year. :)",
        "Several films have been criticized for excessive shaky camera technique. This is one, i could not see the film until the end causing me motion sickness. Severe shaking, all the time. Really sorry! To fill the review there also was the question of the, at times, ridiculous science-fiction, fantasy make-believe props and scenarios in the script which called for the knowing suspension of ones 'understanding of science and scientific nature' in willing acceptance of the story tellers view and description of a likely science-fictional universe with all its associated science-fictional 'quirks' which the story and its characters would portray and which we the viewers would find believable, and I honestly felt this was science-fiction for fools and children, not intelligent adults.",
        "Great Movie. Everyone wants to blame it for too much action at the back half of the movie, along with too much CGI, and the ending. We are no longer in the 20th century, we are in the 21st century and this is what people want to see. I mean look at what the movie has grossed so far. People are going back to the theater multiple times to see it. Superman is the most powerful superhero and his abilities should be displayed. How else was he supposed to fight off the villain(s) he did? With a villain such as Lex Luthor it will be a change of pace as obviously he doesn't possess the powers of Superman. Definitely wasn't perfect in all aspects, but a great start. I have confidence the Man of Steel movies will continue to improve. Good start to a shared universe and I expect that Man of Steel 2 will have more hints to a Justice Leaguer or 2. Looking forward to what solo movies will follow with Justice Leaguers and I hope DCs plan is released at the upcoming Comic Con.",
        "As a child, I knew two types of warriors- Superheroes and Superman. He wasn't one among them, he was one SPECIAL among them. In my life, he is the only character with whom I have connected the most, due to his conflicted state of mind, due to denial of what he deserves, due to him having a control over his emotions and capabilities.I haven't seen the previous series of Superman, and I was gonna miss this one closely too, but I didn't and it turned out as a gift. Set against a theme of emotions, separation, sacrifice, goodness, focus and humanity, this movie is delivered perfectly be it be the character play by Cavill, Adams, Crowe, Shannon, the direction by Snyder or the brain thumping music by Zimmers, it was near perfect. The war scenes, special effects were hugely awesome.\n\nThis movie is set to be an epic this year, one of the bests EVER",
        "every fan will hate it. superman didn't kill anyone. this is worst plot and dialogs put in a movie iv seen in a while.\n\nsome of the reviewers pointed out the failure and i don't need to repeat it. fans will know. this is a piece of crap!!!!!!! But one thing, most of people vote this movie any good. leads me to the truth most of viewer are a mass of cheeps. don't know what they talking bout. but some of them rating the vids good and call themselves fans... thats funny.\n\nso far its a waste of time, don't watch it if you a real fan. you will feel pain even anger.\n\nnothing more to add.",
        "I'm not actually a superman's fan, nor a batman's fan. But this movie, Man of Steel, made me \"oh wow\". I want it more, and more. It's far different from the previous Superman's movie, Superman Return (2006). Zack, Christopher, Henry, Amy, and all the crews, you have done a very nice job to bring this new superman movie to be the best movie, and superman series ever. It's more mature, actions, dramatic, breathtaking, and thriller!!! Zack, I know what you're gonna do next with this Superman, please bring Justice League come to a real action movie. I'm anxiously waiting to watch it.\n\nHaters is gonna hate, just shut the f up!!! Do it first before you speak it out!",
        "Superhero and SF blended once more to create a horror. Sitting in theater and patiently waiting for this shallow movie to develop into nothing produced unique ''are they trolling us?'' feeling all over the place. Above written has by now earned this movie a straight 1 on scale to 10. So the positive sides: 1 point goes to exceptional Michael Shannon who portrayed excellent villain sadly wasted on a bad movie and 1 point goes to Kevin Costner because I'm simply happy when I see him. That equals 3 points. Last point goes to all unsung heroes such as talented guys that made all animations, all people that have put their time and effort into this and above all us, the audience who were lured to watch this boring piece of marketing. Be careful on what you spend your money (I wasn't).\n\np.s. IMDb, try to stop fake score pumping and paid reviews such as ''What defines perfection!'' because you're not the only option you know.",
        "A re-imagining of the Superman story for the modern era. Here Kal-El is an unaccompanied alien sent to America as a political and climate refugee, and is adopted as Clark Kent. Although initially laying low for decades, he is eventually drawn into the open by a powerful gang leader, who was a rival to his birth father. The conflict escalates until Metropolis becomes a war zone. With the violence of his old home following Clark to his new one, how will Clark stop the gang from taking over?",
        "If this is what passes for a \"good\" movie nowadays God help us! This flick is so dumb and is totally wrapped in CG from beginning to end (not good CG either). The script is so bad that even Kevin Costner can't pull off a good acting job in this flick. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Another example of the younger generation trying to remake a great film from long ago and failing terribly at it!! Stupid!",

        "A bit more than a year ago when I found out Henry Cavill who stars in Tudors would be cast as superman as well as Nolan producing and Snyder directing, I knew this movie had a ton of potential even though most of the past superman movies weren't as good as they wanted them to be. From the first moment you sit down to watch it, the storyline and the progression of the movie pulls you further in. All of the crew and actors and actresses play their parts very well and to my surprise Amy Adams played her role as Lois Lane fantastically. A lot of critics have said this movie has had a lot of action but is having too much action in a superhero movie too much? Fantastic movie and definitely an unsurpassed superman movie and the best superhero out there.",
        "This is the type of Superman film I always wanted. After the huge disappointment of Superman Returns, Snyder, Nolan and Goyer were able to create a new Superman with amazing visual effects and story. Henry Cavill nailed it as Superman, Russel Crowe was amazing as Jor-El, Michael Shannon as Zod was brilliant, Amy Adams as Lois Lane was awesome and everyone else was great. I got goosebumps throughout the film,the fight scenes were simply mind-blowing and I was on the edge of my seat. I highly recommend that you go watch this film. You won't be disappointed. This film definitely makes Superman Returns look crap. Man of Steel also surpassed Superman (1978), Superman 2 in my opinion including Superman 3 and... Superman 4: The Quests for Peace.",
        "I loved this movie. Zack Snyder is a genius. Henry Cavill IS Superman. Having following the work of Zack Snyder since 300 to Sucker Punch, I could not go in a theater to watch his last movie. I'm not a big fan of Russel Crowe (except for his part in \"Gladiator\" and \"A Beautiful Mind\") but he's a great Jor-El and drives us into the movie. Michael Shannon is great too. The rest of the cast is not my favorite (Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne...) but with Cavill and Shannon, the show can go on. The Superman of this movie is the same at the comic's, he looks really strong and is ready to sacrifice himself without hesitation. Adding the visual effects similar to Watchmen or 300, we have one of the greatest movies of the year. Rem",
        "Watched Man Of steel this weekend.. What a movie guys..great film with great action sequences..i read the reviews of critics before going to see this movie and iam bit disappointed....but after the movie i will definitely says one thing critics suxx a big time...Man of Steal is actually a beginning with good buildups in first half and mind blowing action sequences in second half...i got what i expected from this movie..One thing to say don't expect a Dark Knight from this movie..\n\nPositives:- Good Direction by Zack.. especially in Action sequences, Good casting Henry Cavil as Superman awesome, Power Packed Actions\n\nnegatives:- Lengthy, little bit dragging",
        "Is Man of steel a good movie ? Yes is not just good is Amazing. Acting, special effect and the music is Spectacular ! Henry Cavil is great and the other actors are amazing. The best DC movie since The Dark Knight. Dark Knight Rises was good but not compared to this ! One of the things that I hate about this movie is the critic review what is wrong with you people this movie has everything you could ever wish for a movie. I cannot wait what Zack Snyder and the crew have for the sequel. Overall ten out of ten. Zack Snyder has really outdone himself with Man of Steel. I really think that DC can surpass Marvel if they keep doing amazing movies like these. Can't wait for the sequel !!",
        "I really loved this film. The action was intense, brutal and very fast. The fights between the villains were epic to the Nth degree, with fights taking out whole blocks (think Transformers)\n\nThe pacing was amazing and nothing seemed out of place. Dialogue, again, was very tight with everyone saying just what they needed to; No silly references, one liners or anything and the tone was serious with a heavy sci-fi influence.\n\nFaora was gorgeous (oh why do the beautiful ones always have to be evil!? ;) and I'm sure the leading man Cavill got the ladies' heartbeats racing too.\n\nOverall, A very well made, excellently styled, paced and acted film. One of the best superhero films I have seen.",
        "A must see movie for any superhero fan! Gripping and intense throughout - it had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Nothing beats seeing Superman fly through the air and destroy his enemies.\n\nHenry did an awesome job playing the role of Superman, i don't think there's been a better one ever. Looks the part, acted brilliantly also.\n\nNostalgic. Memorable. Super!",
        "Best Superman movie ever. Last one suck rock bottom so bad that, even I was skeptic about Hollywood's attempt at making another Superman movie ever again. But when Man of Steel came in theaters and I went to see it. It totally blew me away with it's remake and story telling. The movie itself pretty much had that saying, \"Less Talk, more Action motto\", which helped it out a lot. And thank god Lex Luthor is not the villain in Man of Steel. Other wise the film itself would of suffer terribly.\n\nNow we need a sequel and please no Luthor. Bring out Metallo or Darkseid. No Luthor.",
        "This is my first review on IMDb,first this film contains my favorite film maker,Zack and Christopher.Second the plot wont make u get bored,every second of this film was precious and awesome.Third the visual effect and the sound effect were too awesome,made u felt what u spent were worth.Fourth the casting was satisfied,the actors fitted on every comic characters.Every actors just perform their best acting skill in this film,the face expression and the body movements were satisfied,and the CG was too awesome compare with recent sci-fi film,and don't care the what critics said,just trust your eyes,just go to the nearest theatre,watch this no matter imax or 2d,you wont be regret.",
        "s the man of steel, Cavill (best known from Showtime's The Tudors) displays a magnetic presence and topographic physique in the star-making role that had narrowly eluded him in the past. (He was the runner-up to play Bond in Casino Royale but was deemed too young; Twilight author Stephenie Meyer called him \"my perfect Edward,\" but by the time the novel was optioned he was deemed too old.) As Lois Lane, Adams shows so much pluck that it's a wonder she isn't conscripted for duty on a poultry farm. And the rest of the cast (which also features Ayelet Zurer and Diane Lane as Clark's biological and adoptive mothers, respectively, and Laurence Fishburne as Perry White) fulfill their obligations with aplomb. I do wish, though, that Shannon (as Zod) had been asked to dial back his patented brand of wide-eyed crazy at least intermittently.",
        "I cannot be bothered to write a long review, so here it is: Man of Steel is a perfect example of a film without any understanding of relationships and the importance of character's back stories. It achieves the impressive feat (and I say this with complete sarcasm)of simultaneously offering us, as viewers, no depth or emotional sustenance and treating us as complete idiots who need to be explained the simplest of things in extreme detail. The result? A film that fails to make you give a damn about the possible outcomes of its plot whilst also belittling and underestimating the intelligence of its audience. If you are interested in preserving the integrity of storytelling and relationships within films, do not, as I have so regrettably done, see MoA.",
        "I have been a superman fan since seeing Christopher Reeves first appearance as the man of steel in the cinema in the 70's. I personally thought Brandon Routhe was excellent in Superman returns and was unsure about this new movie. I knew they would shake up the image, the story and the styling. However I was very pleased with this version all in all. It was very emotional in parts and had some great moments. Grumbles......there was no superman theme!!!! very disappointing! my kids and I were ultimately waiting for the proud moment were the superman music broke over the speakers and soup took flight, but alas we were let down. Grumble 2....there were no 'shirt rips' revealing the 'S' however the storyline did not allow for this, but probably will in a second movie, however that itch was scratched a little when Durrell showed his symbol in this fashion. All over though an excellent re do, very well cast, but I just hope that there is the good old Superman theme in the next one.",
        "Clark kent plays superman, a super powered super hero from an alien world. And can I say wow, this movie blew me away. I don't know who writes these things but can I say the story is incredible. The special effects are mind blowing, superman actually looked like he was flying no strings or nothing. Now I just got back from the midnight premier so I'm pretty tired but I give it 5 stars. This movie really makes you feel like you're in a superman comic book. When I was a kid and I read superman comics I always wondered it was like to be superman you know. The comics were fun and you could your imagination, but this really brings superman to life. The ending to this is incredible I had no idea it was coming. Man of steel sadly gets 9/10 only because he didn't change into his superman suit in a telephone booth and that was one of my favorite parts of superman. Everyone should see this movie even my mom.",
        "This is my first review ever, this movie made me make an account just to rate it and review it. Let me start off by saying that the casting bureau has done a great job by choosing Henry for this role. He is just perfect for this role and they made his body into a god's body. His face is typically Superman, square and sharp around the jawline. The action and Special effects in this movie are superb! I did have some trouble with the fact that he doesn't save a couple of people in \"normal incidents\" the story basically goes straight into the big storyline. Also it flashes kind of fast, one minute he's there and the other minute we are a couple of years further, those transactions in time could be done more subtle in my opinion. But those issues don't take away that this is simply one of the best movies I've ever seen!",
        "Watched this as of now (16/09/20) and it was an absolute bore fest/frivolous/annoying. I just finished the batman series yesterday and actually would have rather watched that masterpiece again rather then this rubbish. I actually lost life here, I will watch superman v batman tonight but from what it looks objectively batman does whoop him definitely from the quality and production of the movie. Like superman was awful it had this geeks touch to it. I expected a build up but my god this just felt like torture getting to know these guys. The casting sucked too. How did batman get so much fame and accolades and this just had hardcore fans drawing ?\n\nLove batman but this... life's too short please god bless your hearts and live long and if you're reading this then I am the real superman saving your precious life's.",
        "It seems there are two extreme opinions for this movie. Really good or really bad. Disappointingly, I agree with the lower end. I started this movie with lots of anticipation and excitement but in the end all I can say is it was really long and really boring.\n\nBeing a superman fan, I already know all about his history. So to me, it was like 2/3 of the movie was covering his history and him wandering around. I was so bored. Then finally the action came. I was hoping for some really cool fights. Disappointingly, most of the fights had superman just fly-tackling his enemy or throwing one punch. Finally I was disappointed with the way they solved the \"conflict\" of the story. Too simple, too boring.\n\nHenry Cavill had a plain expression throughout most of the movie. Michael Shannon had a cool Zod look. The movie made up some stuff that's inconsistent with the comics.",
        "A visual masterpiece that redefines Superman with a modern day take. Henry Cavill is great and the supporting cast helps bring the story together. This film delivers the greatest comic book movie fight scene in cinematic history. Man of Steel utilizes a similar story telling art with flashback scenes that are reminiscent of Nolan's Batman Begins. Michael Shannon is great as the antagonist Zod. This film is a spectacle the leaves you amazed. Everything you had ever hoped to see from a Superman film is front and center and exceeds expectations. Zack Snyder has a pulse on this property and is true to the comics while still delivering a film that audiences can follow even if they are not knowledgeable about the source material. This film is terrific from start to finish. Prepare yourselves for a thrill ride!",
        "So this was a movie that will keep most audiences glued to the screen. The action was great and they didn't sway off from the basic story line from the comics. Some minor things could have been better, but it was a great film to open up my summer of new movies. You can also see the work of Christopher Nolan in this film, as it kind of reminded me of The Dark Knight. Zack Snyder did a phenomenal job and he is a very good director. Go watch it while its hot and keep an open mind on the event in this movie.\n\nOverall it was a movie worth my money, and you can't say that about many movies these days. Will watch again.\n\nand wait for the second part!!",
        "I am not a big fan but i did enjoy the old super man movies. For me the new one does not deliver anything. I found it very superficial. I felt the dialogs lack any true meaning or emotions. The story was over-told, it did not let me to figure out anything. So I felt I was a little bit board. The visual effect was stunning but the design of the 'alien stuf'f was absolutely horrible' Anyways the biggest problem for me was that I never felt that anything was real, or there were any real stakes. I expected the movie to be a bit more like 'batman' dark and trying to place the comic hero in to the real world. The cinematography was too nice, like a parfume commercial.\n\nI should have mentioned the positive stuff earlier, but the villain was amazing!!!! if there is one thing I would watch it for him.",
        "Had to say:\"The Best among the Summer Movies\". 'Man of steel' truly was a fresh treating of the iconic Superman that it showed and convinced and gave answers to the audience for the 'what?' and 'why?' questions.That mainly it made a basement for the character.For the first time we almost feels that he is not that much 'SUPER' and is beatable.Before seeing, I got a feeling about the movie that its story would be acceptable because I saw the name'Christopher Nolan' in the 'Story by' list.It it wasn't wrong.Direction was too fantastic except the fact that at some among the middle of the movie, I felt a little bit of 'IT DON'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY'. Hats Off to the Cinematographer and Special effects team for the fantastic 3D experience..",
        "Any and all favorable reviews here are entirely based on cheap glitz, flash, special effects and obnoxiously noisy jags and camera cuts. Small minds with smaller needs.\n\nThis is a GARBAGE superman movie, and as a super hero movie it's par at best.\n\nYou simply CANNOT take a man who stands for protection and justice and make him destroy a CITY. With millions in collateral damage and loss of hundreds of lives assuredly killed in the city destroying battle... Then make him break the rule to kill to save a few people?!!? Such tripe.\n\nSuperman Lives would have done a better job of it.",
        "Thank god i cant waste my money to see this movie on cinema,but me is still in coma about to loose my 2 and half hours to see this childish movie,\n\ni also thinking about those peoples who said this is awesome,,i suggest to those this is a movie for children ,,and i also believe this is a bloody saga is also from a whole childish team whose the planner and maker of this movie here in this movie first 1 and half hour i thought most of time to leave this but again and again me is awaiting to a break through..but never until end firstly Russell Crowe challenges to the General Zod but when the war started he is come to the General Zod for begging that not to kill innocent peoples.",
        "Iam disappointed by the way critics are lashing out at this movie..especially rotten tomatoes and meta critic..personally i feel that this movie is epic and inspiring.Iwould advise not to compare the old one with this new one.i should say that this movie unleashed the super man inside me.QUOTES ARE AMAZING AND INSPIRING,\"MAKE THE WORLD SMALL\"Amazing one.i watched it twice and going for third time.don't miss it.everybody talks about over graphics and all but how else would u show superman.Henry cavill is amazing ,first of all he is a man who has supernatural powers and he feels alienated because of that.so its a journey of a man who has super natural abilities to find who he is and to what reason he came here.amazing movie ...................",
        "was just after watching the amazing spider man 1 and 2 after man of steel and i think its unfair to put the two films in the same category as man of steel it is a much better thought out film better writing better action and much more effort to make a good movie and i would say this not as a big fan of the superman name it needs a good script for superman vs batman but it could be an enjoyable trilogy so well worth a watch it has its flaws but what film doesn't. honestly i would say it was as good as if not better than batman begins. a lot of work to be done with this film but its on the right track so its a must watch for superman fans an enjoyable watch for anyone else",
        "previously I've seen all super man movie but this one is Real super man. The cinematography, Direction, Action, Music ,Story : All is best ever. the money spent by me for this movie was totally worth.\n\nThe representation of the story was in deep so you no need to watch previous super man movies.\n\nEach moment of the movie is full of entertainment .The villain:General Zod was quite good at acting. And Henry Cavill is all time best suitable actor in Super Man movies .\n\nThis time DC comics have best BAT MAN(Christian Bale) AND SUPER MAN (Henry Cavill) of all time.",
        "I love this movie!!! There needs to be a Man of Steel 2!!!!! We all want to see more of Supermans character being developed!! Also there needs to be a little bit more romance! The bath tub scene in Batman vs Suoerman was so cute!! Need more scenes like that to show their relationship growing!!! There needs to be a second solo movie on Superman before they introduce the Justice League or whatever group they're thinking of. There needs to be more focus on Superman himself and his relationship. He's super human yes but he's also an American and lived on earth all his life so we need to see the more human side of him. Not just superhuman turned all the way up all the time. We need to see his guard down more!",
        "After seen this new movie about one of my favorites heroes of childhood, I got to say that Znyder, Goyer and Nolan have done a great job. writing and directing a movie about a man who's superpowers are pretty much limitless it's everything but easy. but they have created a more mature and serious character on Clark Kent - Kal-el to empower Superman with a new attitude towards the duty of been the man of steel. i'm sure there will be a lot of Reeve's fans who will claim that he's the best superman ever, but if you see this new superman in a more wider perspective you will realize that the evolution of Superman is the one presented on this epic movie. for me it's a 9 out of 10.",
        "I feel like I've just watched Matrix: Revolutions...\n\nShaky-cam was REALLY distracting Acting was pretty strong across the board CGI was very good Music was generic Some nice imagery but a bit too brief Zack Snyder feels like he's been toned down by the studio It was LONG but didn't feel LONG.\n\nGo and see it if you have 3 hours to kill, it's entertaining. I feel like 'Man Of Steel 2' will be the one worth seeing... You know, this is the 'Batman Begins' of its series... now we just have to wait for the 'The Dark Knight'\n\n7/10",
        "I watched this movie twice between 2 days period, and i still don't have any objection if someone asked me to watch more. Man of Steel totally raised the bar between all superheroes movies in regard with the special effect, angle things and all of cinematography stuff that gave me a continuous wow along the 143 mins. The story is developed nicely in the first hour, smoothly composed between Clark childhood and teenager. End-up with fight scene that shown yeah this is a God Fight ! Cavill and Amy got their touch, and it beautifully wrapped by Crowe & Costner's senior touch. Zod role also perfectly granted to Shannon as his not usual class of acting. Yes Man of steel perfectly crafted, well round, solid, and made marvel troops need to revisit their plans.",
        "Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan has more up their sleeves. After seeing the trailers, I doubted whether there is any point in watching in the film (well, don't misunderstand me, I meant the story-line was almost obvious after watching the trailers). Still I simply couldn't resist booking the first show. After a few hours of waiting due to some technical issues, the show finally began. Man, I have to say, the above mentioned guys, there is absolutely no words to describe them. Super story line (even though it was what I guessed after watching the trailers), amazing direction, superb camera works and editing and that background score, all were exceptional. The 3D effects disappointed a bit though. But everything else along with the stunning scenes is more than enough for a fan like me to give a 10 star rating. For those who are waiting for further reviews: Just go and watch it, you are missing it out.",
        "This movie was outstanding. It did several things; it focused on the character of the character, it provided a superman with heart, humility, and steel (hence the title). As we found out with Returns, no one likes a superman who has it all, it's not relevant to many of us. I enjoyed Returns and for fans of the 70's and 80's Christopher Reeves Superman movies it hit the mark. However, it isn't relevant any more and Roth didn't do a good job of portraying a goofy/nerdy Kent that no one would give a second look too. This too is an outdated theory as well anyways.\n\nThis Superman was brawny, hairy, seething with heart, and unapologetic. This superman was willing to do what needed to be done and (without spoiling anything) went places Batman wouldn't even go.",
        "I have just seen MOS and I must say just WOW WOW WOW. What a film. This beats the Avengers to a little pulp. Yes it did not have the comedy that the Avengers had and I am glad it did not as that would have ruined the film. I am fed up of the critics saying that it was nothing like the Donner films, well get out of the 70's and into 2013. If MOS would of been like the superman of 1978 they would of been complaining about it trying to be like the original superman just like superman returns. This is a must see film for all superman films and i can not wait for the sequel. This had all the action that superman returns did not have and made up for that film big time. The superman film we have all been waiting for is finally here.",
        "Man of Steel....almost had me worried until it went into full gear and realized it was all part of the plan *inputs Joker quotes*. From super fast paced to so so slow, then they come together in the end to create perfect symbiosis. Sorry Christopher Reeves Margot Kidder and Richard Donner...Zack Snyder came well armed with Henry Cavill, Amy Adams along with an amazing writer in David Goyer as well as the supporting cast Diane Lane, Kevin Cosnter, and Russel Crowe. Have to say it was not at all what I expected in how the story was delivered but one has to appreciate the effort they put in to get so many details into the 2 hours and 23 minutes without it seeming rushed to where it takes you out of the mindset and into frustration. They succeeded where many other films have failed \"Yes Green Lantern...YOU! With your rushed and hole filled plot.\" If anyone is contemplating whether or not to go see Man of Steel, just do it!",
        "I had read quite a number of reviews for MOS on the day I went to see it and they had me slightly worried so I went in slightly more apprehensive than I wanted to but I came out so happy! I love Superman and loved the way they showed everything. Some of the reviews that have been written up mention things that are so silly and if they had been paying attention, then they would realize there are reasons for some things. Go in expecting action and an interesting beginning. Actors great, Henry Cavil is a wonderful Superman. The effects were great and the relationship between Clark and Lois is totally justified. Can't wait to see it again and watch the next one. Hopefully we see more of the Daily Planet and Clark doing his reporting duty which will keep things interesting. Also looking forward to the Lois and Clark relationship being delved into a bit more. Overall I really enjoyed it and came out a happy Superman fan-",
        "Don't listen to the critics! they are are sell out marvel fans which means whenever a DC movie comes out they bash the hell out if it. I went and saw the movie last night in IMAX 3D, and it was completely remarkable! I went into this movie thinking it would be great but it far surpassed that! I highly recommend seeing this movie in IMAX so you could capture its beauty! The acting was amazing! Henry cavil did an awesome job and he pushed his body to the limits! he wast ripped as hell! Including all the other actors such as Russel crow all played fantastic as well. This movie is darker from the girly iron mans so i believe the age group for this movie should be in the teens.\n\nPS vote 10s on IMDb for man of steel because its being bashed by all the Marval fans!",
        "I thought this movie was great, it finally made sense why a villain wants to destroy the world. It showed a lot of Superman's past. It also shows Superman using his god like powers, cause that's what he is, a god among men. Other reviewers are saying it's action was over the top but that's what you get with Aliens from another world with such power. Best bit about the movie is that there is no kryptonite in the film, Kryptonite has been getting old and it's good to see that Superman can be beaten without having to use the deadly substance. It also made sense of why he's so powerful and can fly, but the bad part is that the film didn't explain how he got the heat vision power but they gave it a lot more uses than fighting enemies. I gave this movie 8/10. Action Blockbuster of the year.",
        "I don't say the movie was bad. I say that it was not as good as I expected it (and not only me). I didn't know much about Superman and i guess that's where I did wrong. I strongly believe that the movie is (and was) for MOS fans, the ones who know and like Superman and want to watch a \"good\" movie of him. Generally, the movie is boring, irritatingly serious and really, REALLY confusing. The special effects are excellent but, seriously, with every superhero movie having numerous scenes with such effects, I don't think that this is an advantage. To give a conclusion, I don't think the movie is worth-seeing if you're not a Superman fan. I can list more than 10 superhero movies much more better than MOS who are remarkable for this genre (for example : The Dark Knight trilogy, Ironman, Hancock, Spiderman 1 & 2, the Avengers etc.) Thanks for reading!!!",
        "Man of Steel: The best superman movie i have ever seen and the best in superman series. The two reason i wanted to see this movie, 1) Story written by Christoper Nolan, All we knew that Christoper Nolan is a good director and this time he himself showed, he is best in even as producer.\n\n2) Had little bit of hope on Zack Snyder because of 300. Zack snyder gonna have another golden feather on his director's hat.\n\nBetter watch it in 3d. The visual effects drives you crazy and makes your jaw-drop. I bet you guys will love it. PS: Everyone have played their character well and showed well. This movie shows that even superheros are vulnerable at some stages. Must watch movie. #ManOfSteel steals people's heart :)",
        "You have two choices in doing a reboot of Superman. You either do take after take until the actor is punished enough to actually get over the psychology involved in convincing himself he is Superman.(David Fincher's 20,000 Leagues will work) Or you do a Avatar like CGI version where it doesn't matter if the actor looks like superman as long as he can move and sound like superman. You have to compare it to the far superior last two Dark Knight movies. The Villains had lots of inspiration to form their characters. Heath Ledger had A Clockwork Orange and Sid Vicious while Tom Hardy had Bare Knuckle Brawler and King of the Gypsies Gorman Bartley. (Or is it Bartley Gorman?) David S. Goyers movies are hit and miss. Being the Prolific Screanwriter he is, he also wrote The Crow 2, Jumper & Ghost Rider 2.",
        "This was a wonderful movie. Based on the perfectionist reviews that have to see a flaw in something. If these views were followed then new reviews on perfection will develop. I'm a huge superman fan and I believe this is the best one yet. Congratulations Hans Zimmer and Zack Snyder. A lot of people are looking down on the modern suit of superman because of the red underwear not being present and other things within the movie that I'm not going to spoil it for anyone. The acting was very intense and there were a lot of scenes in this movie that got you into the situation of superman. I have recommended this movie to many people and they have have come back with only positive outlooks on the movie. Don't criticize this movie because it doesn't satisfy your picky wants.",
        "This movie goes through the gate in full sprint and only picks up from there. We get to see more of Krypton in this movie than any other. It's a rich full world and gives us more incite to these people. The action is practically nonstop and slows down just enough for us to catch our breath. During those times it gets pretty emotionally charged and at times brought a tear to my eye. This is the Superman everyone has been waiting for since Chris Reeve made us believe a man can Fly. Cavill does this but also the responsibility and the burden it carries of being all powerful. The stable full of high caliber actors only proves it's not just the effects we crave but good acting and a great story. This does all that and more. It brings us that much closer to a Justice League us fans have been waiting years to see.",
        "Can an excellent actor save a bad script in a movie? My answer in NO .. it was disaster.\n\nWhat a waste of time.",
        "OK I \"liked\" the movie A LOT....OK OK loved it...to an extent. This is definitely like no superman you've seen before big screen or small. There were quite a few twists and turns that have not been seen in the world of Superman yet. I wouldn't say this movie will make you forget about Reeve or Donner. This doesn't takeover or erase anything not even SMALLVILLE or Superman: TAS. Which can be seen as a good thing Rather than replacing them we just have another version that could sit comfortably along side them. This was definitely the most serious and realistic ( OMG I'm calling Superman realistic smh lol) take. This isn't an outright compliment,the seriousness did serve as both a and a con. One thing I did not miss was bozo the clown running around calling himself Lex Luthor. If and when this series tackles Lex I hope he's done more in the vane of Smallville and DCUs serious take. Final words, there's a lot to love and a lot so not much. If you are a general movie goer you will love this If you are die hard obsessed superman fan like me you will love it but you will find its not without faults.",
        "This movie was an amazing thrill ride that I enjoyed by the end of the movie. Great action, back story, Krypton scenes, and plot. Of course their were a few minor flaws but the good outweighs the bad by a long run. The problem I think I see with people that didn't like the movie is either, they wanted a Donner Superman. Or their expectations were unbelievably high for a Goyer/ Snyder movie. If your a comic/Superman fan I'm sure you will love it. The performances were outstanding. Henry Cavill is the new Superman for me and I liked Amy Adams as Lois Lane too. The true standout performances were Russel Crowe as Jor El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. This movie delivers on all the parts it wanted to and I anticipate the sequel.",
        "I went into this film expecting a true 'superhero' action film. I believe that in that sense, this film was somewhat of a disappointment. The film did have a few intense action sequences, but in general, I didn't feel that 'Man of Steel' delivered nearly as much action, or even close to as much comedy, as for example, any of the films from the 'Ironman' series, or even the 'Spiderman' series. I know this film is being billed as a 'reboot' of the original 1980's 'Superman', and although it has been quite some time since I've watched that film, I do remember a sense of comedy present that I felt was simply missing this time around. It is though still a generally entertaining film, and Amy Adams played the 'Lois Lane' lead convincingly enough. I especially enjoyed Kevin Costner (as Superman's adoptive father) and also Christopher Meloni (as USAF Colonel) in their supporting roles.",
        "I am afraid its not as good as it should be. The graphics i find them annoying as you cannot understand whats going on and there is chaos. The plot is OK.. a mix of the original S.1&2.Finally,superman is not supposed to kill people!He represents all the goodness etc. hence thats also something i didn't like much about the character. Btw Extremely good selection for the role of Jonathan Kent, Jor El..",
        "This movie is a worth watch which makes you watch for second time with its extraordinary special effects and performances. Everything about the movie is worth anticipating and it doesn't let you down and certainly make think that it is the best superhero movie you have ever watched. The action sequences make you scream with excitement.The story gives some moral as well which is additional feature that cant be seen in many sci-fi thrillers. In many ways it is tough competitor of other superhero films including the best storyline and screen play. The film goes like a stream flow where there is no scope for boredom.Henry cavil gave his best performance which is quite outstanding.The importance of every character creates a specific interest that instantly makes you a fan of it. Finally its a film that you cant miss to watch twice or more",
        "Finally the Superman we deserve... Man of Steel far outranks Avengers or any other Superhero movie ever made... Exceptional Storytelling...Snyder has taken fight sequences to a whole new level... Fight scenes are unlike anything ever seen before in movies till date..I highly recommend anyone reading this review to watch this movie in IMAX 3D... Background score by Hans Zimmer is among the best he has given till date... Don't bother reading the critics review... They are still stuck in the Superman of 1900s...For the era we live in and the technology that is available, this is the best Superman movie that can possibly be made... MUST MUST WATCH!!!",
        "I was very excited before to watch this movie. I don't read Superman's comics so I don't have a great knowledge about this superhero. By the way, I after seeing this movie I can say that is just amazing! In the first part we see the progression of the hero, while in the second part there's more action. It is just perfect. Superman is not only a hero, but an alien. A man of two worlds. I like so much this interpretation. Generally, Superman is a simple hero, while in this movie he is more psychological than you can expect. The soundtrack is fantastic, maybe the best work for H.Zimmer. I cant' wait for the second chapter of this saga!",
        "A cinematic blockbuster with action scenes that will just AMAZE you! Yes, this is a different take on the most iconic Superhero that was ever created but, in my opinion, it is better for it. This is a updated and modern Superman for this generation of movie-goers, as it is for those of us who didn't grew up with the original Superman movies back in the late 1970's and 1980's . Many fans have already said to ignore critics as most of their reviews are very harsh. I agree with the fans. Many of the critics compare this movie to the original superman movies. To me, this is very unfair and biased as they can't accept the fact that this is a reboot and thus a different Superman from the one that they remember from the original films. This new Superman is grounded and more serious.All in all, go watch this movie and support it because the future of not only this new Superman film franchise hangs in the balance but the entire DC Cinematic Universe!",
        "First of all, screw all critics that saying this movie focus too much on CGI and lacking in character and plot development. In fact the character of Clark kent/superman is very well develop. And also this movie features some of the best action sequences ever put to film. Especially the mid air battle between superman and zod. But of course like all movie,this movie is not perfect and has its flaws( which I not going to mention here). But overall this is one hell of a superhero movie.. This easily top the god awful ironman 3 as the best superhero movie in 2013. Man Of Steel is not only one of the best superhero movie ever.. It easily is one of the best movie ever !",
        "I am not a big lover of all out action movies and I tend to avoid them, but in homage to the original action man I had to go see this and I have to say its one of the best films I have seen.\n\nCavill is not upstaged by the bigger stars which is a blessing and you want the action more and more, your on the edge of your seat rooting for him to get up and sort all the problems in the world.\n\nLois is a bit cheesy but that's forgiven as its what you expect in the role, thank god Laurence Fishburne doesn't try to upstage others and Kevin Costner performs brilliantly.\n\nDef recommend seeing it, but not necessarily in 3D",
        "I remember watching the superman movies at the drive-in with my parents in the early 80's. They were great movies and they make you feel as a kid that anything is possible and that people are basically good. Man Of Steel combines that same energy and excitement as the old superman movies, but in a high-tech HD kinda way. The effects are amazing and even my 16 year- old thought the movie was cool... that alone says a lot :-). The critics who have said this is not a great movie, are wrong. I believe there will be more in a series and this new guy is a great superman. Even if you are not into that whole comic book thing (I am not), you will like the way this one is done.",
        "!WOW! its perfect for Man of steel its Enjoyable movie, most action packed, visually stunning, breath taking fight scenes movie ever made...Plus it's probably the greatest superhero scifiction movie ever made... Despite that it still falls short of being the superman I expected...the movie has some flaws.. But overall were just gonna have to live with this superman it might not be the normal superman story we are all familiar with but parallels still exist and this movie would have to be judged on its own merits .At least one thing that remains eternal is the fact that the steeled one saves the earth and so still remains a hero even if it's in our thought and fantasies.",
        "This is my first time that I'm writing a review and I'm choosing to write one because I can't believe people are bashing this movie. Man Of Steel was such a good movie. We watched it in regular IMAX not IMAX 3D and in my opinion the best superman ever made to date. I am not going to give anything away about the movie but it is well worth your time and money. Henry Cavill did a great job being superman, I'm not a big Amy Adams fan so i personally think they could have chosen a better Lois Lane, Michael Shannon did a good job and Russell Crowe was awesome. I don't like cheering against Superman but Antje Traue was a true bad ass in this movie. When its all said and done this movie is definitely better than Iron Man 3 and has better action than the Avengers. For anyone who is on the fence about going to see this movie, get in your car and go see it. It is worth every penny. Definitely a movie to see in the theaters and in IMAX. Not a big fan of 3d plus being that I already wear glasses and putting another pair of glasses on top of the ones i have on now seems pretty ridiculous.",
        "I am not a big fan of the SUPERMAN movies. But, this particular action packed ZACK SNYDER film was an exceptional. The plot was vast for 143 minutes, so the movie was really fast. I totally liked the new SUPERMAN costume which was really cool. HENRY CAVILL was a great choice for the character. He was charming, smart and a massive upgrade of Brandon Routh. MICHAEL SHANNON did well in his General ZOD role. Although AMY ADAMS was kind of old to be Lois Lane. The action scenes were great. Sound effects were great. although I think there could be a bit better 3D effects.. Overall, the talented director almost nailed it.. A must watch for comic lovers. I'm eagerly waiting' for the sequel.",
        "First of all, I know superman since my first step in this world... And from what is saw yesterday, this is not superman as we knew, I mean a nice family movie, action, love...\n\nThe story started good, nice flash back, and introducing step by step any characters, amazing casting !! Then from what i saw it looks like just an avenger remake, big brawl, human & hero vs bad people. Fight scenes a really nice but sorry this is not superman guys !!! It looks like they wanted to end the movie suddenly !\n\nI won't give my point of view depending of how strong the guy fight or oh many building they will blast for the scene...That's why i will only give a 7 ! I expected something better, after seen the great trailer and the first hour before the mess started.\n\nBy the way I hope you'll enjoy it",
        "Saw the film today was looking forward to seeing it but ended up disappointed. The special effects was brilliant but storyline wasn't up to scratch. The storyline had been put together from other films and TV series i.e. Opening sequence of Star Wars episode 3, Twister, ID4,V, Smallville Season 9, Incredible Hulk the 80's TV series/X-Men. The fight scene between General Zod and Superman had been stolen from Matrix Revolution when Neo and Mr Smith fight, I got bored by this time and didn't care for the rest of the film.\n\nSurely it is time that script writers stop stealing parts of other films and come up with an original script of their own.",
        "I will be outright honest about this movie. It was absolutely brilliant. Some people say it had no story to it? What?! It had quite enough of story. I won't spoil the movie but anyone can see at the beginning that there is a story. Also the action is just so amazing. It is to be expected because 'Man Of Steel' Superman in other words is a super being. Destruction is to be expected in a movie. In all honesty this movie was so up to par with the Dark Knight Rises movie.\n\nThe director and producer as always have produced excellent results. I commend them for creating such an amazing movie. The Superman actor was quite brilliant and the best by far as a candidate. Movie in general was so awesome it blew my mind away. I want to watch it again and again. It deserves a much better rating in fact.",
        "I am a huge superman fan and was dazzled and charmed watching this amazing and brilliant movie. I went in with high expectations from the and this movie has completely met them all. Great impressive visuals and by far so of the best action sequences in a comic book movie are It easily beats The Avengers and every MCU film in every single way and will definitely rise to the top as a huge classic film . I don't know why the critics are saying that it focused more on action sequences than on Superman's character. It was balanced and well thought in all aspects. Its a must see film for every Comic book fan and in my view its not only the best movie of 2013 but probably the best comic book movie of all time.",
        "This is just one of stupid Hollywood blockbusters. The story just makes no sense, it's illogical, inconsistent and childish. It is an insult to the intelligence. The movie looks great and the action is good, but i got bored by the narrative.",
        "Im not a Superhero person but i was floored by this underrated masterpiece.Great. Cast Great effects. In my opinion not only the best Superhero film ever made but definitely the best film of 2013. The religious aspects were awe inspiring. The flashbacks scenes were done extremely well.Didn't want it to end. Cavill is best Superman since George Reeves. Michael Shannon is excellent has General Zod and Lawrence Fishburne is terrific as Perry White. Excellent.Cant wait for sequelIm not a Superhero person but i was floored by this underrated masterpiece.Great. Cast Great effects.

The flashbacks scenes were done extremely well.Didn't want it to end. Cavill is best Superman since George Reeves. Michael Shannon is excellent has General Zod and Lawrence Fishburne is terrific as Perry White. Excellent.Cant wait for sequel",
        "This movie takes the audience on a very effective journey showing what it would take for a person to become Superman without tarnishing the feeling of the character. Clark begins as a child with strange abilities that distance him from the outside world and ends the movie as both the hero and the person any fan would expect him to be, learning many of the lessons that transform him into Superman in new, surprising, moving and genuine ways.\n\nZack, Henry and the rest of the team successfully updated the Man of Steel for a modern world and audience without alienating long time fans. He's still all that is Superman, just in a modern world, with modern consequences. In this rare case, you do get to have your super-cake and eat it, too.",
        "If you compare this against Transformers, this movie will come out smelling of roses. On the other hand, if you're ever so slightly nostalgic for something as good as the Batman reboot, then I suggest you stay away from this. Most facets of this movie are good. The CGI and the action sequences lived up to my expectations. Even the casting was good(especially Russell Crowe and Henry Cavill, a perfect cast for the role of Superman). The movie failed to deliver because of the laughably TERRIBLE script.\n\nIt felt like the scriptwriter was writing a prequel to a superman reboot, that somehow setting up the next movie for the franchise was more important than delivering with the one he's writing. I sincerely hope the movies to follow in this franchise aren't as disappointing.\n\nGood movie, terrible story.",
        "Let's get something straight away. I usually enjoy Zack Snyder's movies and eagerly awaited his take on a comic book legend. However, with Man of Steel he managed to pull off an amazing triple of too long, rushed and a bit boring! Good action sequences towards the end of the movie can't save this one for me, although do bring it up to 5/10 from a lower mark. Maybe Superman is just too hard to deal with - a lead character who is overpowered and not human takes a special actor and story to deal with in movie length. In my view this effort suffers in comparison to the longer character development of TV series Smallville, and the better lead acting of Christopher Reeve in Superman 2 all those years ago. OK for a Sunday afternoon, but I doubt I'd re-watch.",
        "When I first saw this film in theaters, I was beyond blown away by how much life this movie brought to Superman. The score/soundtrack is \ud83d\udc4c and every time I re-watch the movie I just get up and say YES. Seriously don't understand the hate for it (But those reviews are from critics who only care about if the movie is 'PERFECT\"). I mean I'd give it a SOLID 9/10 HITS ALL THE RIGHT SPOTS THAT A SUPERMAN MOVIE SHOULD. If you haven't seen MAN OF STEEL yet, you've got to re-think your life choices.",
        "I have been waiting for this movie since the first picture i saw online. It released this Friday but because of critics review i didn't watch it but today i made my mind as i couldn't take it anymore i am a big fan of superman and i was really looking forward for the reboot.\n\nThe movie is awesome. All the characters in the movie did justice to \"man of steel\". I enjoyed every scene of the movie didn't get bored in any part of it. Will watch it again and again.. Don't want to spoil the story but just want a suggestion for viewers don't think of smallville or any previous superman and Enjoy it. Thanks to team of man of steel for making this fantastic movie.",
        "I always view films for the first time with no expectations and no preconceptions about what the movie should be like. This is exactly what you need to do for this film, if you are expecting it to be like any other superman you've ever seen you will be disappointed.\n\nThe movie has more of a sci-fi feel than a superhero fell but thats exactly what it is, Superman is an alien after all.\n\nAction scenes in this film blow any other out the water in terms of scale of destruction.\n\nCavill plays superman well and will look forward to seeing how he plays Clark Kent in the sequel.",
        "In my opinion \"Man Of Steel\" is a series of chopped scenes edited together to create a chaotic mess. There was zero flow except for the beginning. Its two hours of 1-2 min poorly scripted scenes, shaky camera work, and deafening audio. The dialogue seems rushed and corny. The movie jumps around all over the place and just never seems to head in any direction other than chaos. I agree it was better than the \"Superman Returns\" but where is the writing and screenplay that went into Watchmen?!\n\nIt definitely does not deserve an 8/10 on IMDb.com. 5 to 6 Stars at most.",
        "Superman.... superman.......!!!! The old 1978 movie theme was composed in such a way that the first few tones could be synced with the character's name... and he did such extraordinary things... like land a plane using his hands inside a stadium...\n\nMAN of Steel is a refreshing take on this iconic character.. infusing a more human side to the character in terms of emotions, attachment to family, and so on.. The new costume was also a welcome change... As to the conclusion, it serves the purpose that Zack Snyder wanted and answers a question never before addressed in the comics or cartoon series save for the one episode in the Justice League where an alternate dimension man of steel lobotomizes the villain Doomsday with his heat vision... Russel Xrowe gives a whole new representation of the character of Jor- El. Jonathan Kent is also given more importance than in the old films.. It appeals to all... those who know superman and those who don't.. Can't wait for a sequel to the movie to roll out...",
        "There are multiple great moments in the film that hint at the good film this could've been but the story ultimately manages to be both rushed and overly long. Signifying that Snyder just doesn't know how to deal with/resolve pacing problems.",
        "All I have to say about this film is all in the title to this review...Just go see it...As other reviewers have said on here: You won't be disappointed...As great as everyone here on IMDb says...Great cast, great acting, great script, great CGI, great cinematography, great action sequences, great directing (love Zack Snyder's work), overall fantastic storytelling...Henry Cavill is great as Superman. I have to admit that I was one who enjoyed Brandon Routh in \"Superman Returns\" and I was a little skeptical when they had cast Henry, but I was proved wrong, he was amazing, just AMAZING. Like I said, all the actors were amazing in their roles. Just beautiful...A must see!",
        "As a movie this was okay. Not sure what all the hype about it was though. To me Man of Steel was just another tired origin story and personally I'm about to start going into the theater a half hour after it starts. I mean, let's be honest. If you don't know where any of these characters come from or how they came to be it's time for you to pick up a comic and read about it. When the movie finally got away from the origin stuff it was entertaining though.",
        "My expectations were very high for this movie , and let me tell you they were matched!!\n\nThis movie has a lot of action and has the most awesome fighting scenes ever!!! This is the movie that all superman fans were waiting for.\n\nThe character doesn't go to deep as in other movies, don't expect to be like the Dark Knight because there are two very different kind of heroes here, but i can assure you are going to be blown away :)\n\nI recommend this movie , its a lot of fun , lot of action , you are definitely going to spend well your money on this one.\n\nPlease ENJOY it!!! i give this movie a 9/10",
        "This movie takes a slightly different turn in the normal superman story. The scenes were action packed. Most of the actors were superb. I just wanted more. I wanted more back story. I wanted to feel the relationship between Clark and his dad. Just watching the trailers made me excited to feel the tie between Clark and Jon Kent. Maybe the trailers gave away too much of the story between them. I wanted to feel the weight of why Clark is who he is. It had that potential. The camera work is annoying. Every scene in the beginning hour of the movie is so shaky. The lens is pulling in and out of focus sometimes and it doesn't sit well with 3d.\n\nI wanted to give this a 10/10 so bad. It just couldn't do it. Zack Snyder brought great action scenes. The way Zack Snyder told the story was lacking. There was nothing wrong with the story. It just needed more. All in all it is a must see and must own on blu ray.",
        "This movie is the best super hero movie ever created. The critics are morons and don't know what they are talking about when they rated this a 59 and rated superman returns a 75 which was a god awful superman son movie. Man of steel was the superman movie that i have been waiting for since i watched my first superman movie. It was balls to the wall action with an amazing story line. every character was perfect and every single one had purpose to be in the movie. Man of steel showed what it would be like if superman was real it wasn't like the comic books where he saves everyone it shows realism and shows how he means hope for humans against the kryptonians. This is a must see movie in my eyes definite 10/10 :)",
        "Okay, now before you read this keep in mind that everyone is entitled to their own opinions and I am not here to argue, just stating a fact about how awesome Man of Steel was! It's more than 2 & a half hours long and I am certain that even if there were a 1000 probabilities I can not see a better Superman movie than this, but there is a lot of room for improvement and there were a great deal of flaws in the movie,most of which are due to the rhythm and balance of storytelling. Do also keep in mind when watching this movie that it's a \"Superman Movie\" and none of this is real but the CGI used were damn impressive, making it as close to reality as possible. The cinematography was out-freaking-standing and props to Henry Cavill for such a brilliant performance. - 8/10",
        "I have been a fan of Nolan movies .With Man of Steel he has elevated Superman movie franchise to a whole new level.Most of the viewers would agree that this is the best Superman movie ever to be made taking into account all the visual effects, characterization, screenplay & 3D effects.However I have rated this 8/10 as I feel that the movie runs a tad long & certain scientific jargon is useless in such movies.Avengers scored well as it had witty dialogs & well mapped characters.Man of Steel does show Superman in a new avatar & revamped version, but it could have been turned into an ultimate movie experience.Hats off to Henry Cavill,Zack Snyder & CHrstopher Nolan for overhauling the Superman series.",
        "Normally in all Superman movies Superman was a hero, well he still is but we saw also an emotional and vulnerable side of him. This movie let us feel what he felt. We didn't watch just a hero rising and saving the earth. We watched a man from another planet adapting to earth. The price for having super powers, keeping secrets, living with a low profile and all other sacrifices.I really like that. The character fits in to the role and also the cast was well chosen. Honestly, they were also a lot of questions answered in the movie. For example the suit or the \"S\" logo. Details were also very good. The atmosphere, gaining power from the radiation of the sun. Even the theory where they all set colonies and the idea behind that. Good chosen cast, good directed and acted. Well done.",
        "This film was great don't get me wrong, its just that Louis Lane never really knew who Superman really was, even back in the cartoon sure she knows who Clark was but didn't know he was Superman. But hey it was still AMAZING. OK now the acting and action part. The acting was a bit forced by Henry, but I can live with it, Amy Adams on the other hand did better than expected. So I'll give the acting 3/5. Action time. The action was very CG Heavy, but for this movie it was totally acceptable, IT WAS BADASS. I'll give the action 4/5. So I give this movie a 7 in a half/10. This movie is a good trip to the theaters. P.S. I will be mainly making superhero movies so yeah.",
        "I was excited to see this movie, and knew that Christopher Nolan would not let me down. I have really liked all of his movies and consider him one of the best if not the best director of our time.\n\nNot only did he not disappoint he surpassed my expectations in every way possible. Being a huge Superman fan I would like to think that I am a little biased as far as liking the movie, but in all honesty it is truly that good! Absolute genius storytelling, from both Zach Synder and Christopher Nolan. Please ignore all the bad reviews from the critics, I have read quite a few of them and none of them seem to have a justifiable reason for giving such a bad review. the users are the ones who are getting it right! I I would rate this movie an 11 if I could.",
        "So after 2006......Superman is once again back and this time more stronger and bolder....no one can take a chance on him...The persona of batman haven't vanished yet and Mr.Nolan presented another superhero once again...but phew......a great movie with strong story line, superb action, amazing chemistry of superman with his mother and Miss Lane and best part his entry as alter ego of Mr Clark Kent in Daily Planet that too in end of movie.....really amazed to watch this movie.....General Zod proved to be very strong villain for superman and his father....Brilliant performance by Henry cavil, Russell Crowe and Amy Adams......a remarkable creation from Zack Synder and last but not least the background score by Hans Zimmer.....Super Fantastic Man of Steel........",
        "What ever happened to Superman and Lois Lanes son?",
        "I am surprised by the number of negative reviews saying this movie goes over the top in action or lacks direction in certain spots.\n\nSure, this movie was expected to be the best thing since sliced bread when it was announced or when the trailer came out. What this movie is, is a contemporary Superman movie.\n\nThe only fault in this movie is Amy Adams as Lois Lane, some would say that the inclusion of random action sequences from Zod take away from the movie. Personally, if done any other way the critics would simply find something else to complain about.\n\nGranted, this movie is not a carbon copy of Nolan's batman trilogy, but should it be?\n\nI enjoyed this movie and even though I expected a revelation and didn't get it, I saw someone worthy of being Superman and want to see more....",
        "I sat through all of this only because I had time to kill. All of the following are terrible; acting, plot-line, reliance on CGI, villains, heroes, length of film, the waste of oxygen consumed while living through this tedium and anything else about it I've not mentioned.\n\nI watched this with a teenager and they left to sit in another room. I'm really not sure why anybody has given this any credit. Were there any murders in Hollywood when this was released? I've marked it as 1 out of 10 as I'm not allowed to give zero.This should have been straight to DVD. Or better, to the bin.\n\nDo yourself a favour and watch something else instead. Use oxygen wisely. You have been warned.",
        "If you like constant mayhem, destruction and stick figure acting then this movie is for you. This is the most one-dimensional Superman movie I've seen yet. Disjointed and robotic, if you know nothing about Superman's story at the outset, then you'll know precious little at the end of it. Super awesome effects are wasted on wanton carnage that add nothing to the drama of Superman's plight. Everything about this movie feels fake and underdone except for the new costume design and Superman's bulging biceps, pectoral muscles and abs. But then, that's all the viewers may want to see. That and a tittering sickly sweet melodramatic Amy Adams fawning over him and being submissively cooperative. How do they all make it out alive after all that happens? Too bad there was no story to back up the conclusion. Just about one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen.",
        "I had been hyped up by friends to see this film, but when i did it didn't live up to its potential. It was backed with great writers, actors ( Michael Shannon being one of my favourites) but the director was a definite issue. Although i enjoy most of Snyder's work (mainly 300), I think his weakest side is his story telling, which Man of Steel relies heavily on. He focuses too much on the aesthetics of the film, neglecting the build up of the story. What really saved this movie from being a disaster for me was that the acting was pretty good. With the overall hype behind this film I just didn't think it lived up to its reputation.",
        "Christopher Nolan is one of the best script writers. And he has a capability to show that even BATMAN & SUPERMAN are vulnerable at some point. I haven't seen a Superman movie as good as this one. Henry Cavil is perfect as Superman- Man of steel, while Amy Adams is one of the perfect Lois Lane. Russel Crowe is really effective as a father and Jor-El. The perfect thing is the character build up. Christopher Nolan & Zack Snyder have introduced superman perfectly, i think all those who loved superman will like it & the people who are new to superman would love it too. General Rod is pretty dangerous. He is the only who pisses of superman. Overall special effects are really nice and i think every single penny spent on Man of steel is worth....",
        "It has been a while since the last Superman film came out - I wonder why we are not getting series on this franchise like the Spiderman films. This instalment is so beautifully done - the entire film is run with lots of shades of blue symbolising our man in steel's brand. Zack Snyder has delivered another edge of the seat thriller and though it is violent in terms of action, I suppose that goes with the plot and tight story line. The scenes of when our caped hero, lifts from the ground into the sky, gives you a thrill that was not there in any of the earlier films which were more soft. Henry Cavill as Superman deserves a hand as he has blended into the comic character with ease and makes us not miss Christopher Reeve at all. I wish we have more instalments coming around the corner as Henry Cavill has the presence to take it further. A movie definitely for the die-hard fans of Superman and is worth to include in your collection.",
        "The movie is framed and presented really well, as expected from the brilliant team. I can bet on the fact that this is the best portrayal of the story of Superman origin, along with perfect casting of the various characters. Henry Cavil has been awesome and at a point with his facial glow and awesome muscular build, he feels like an ORIGINAL Superman. Amy Adams has been beautiful and charming too. The pace of the movie is good. The action scenes are perfect, one of the best i have liked. Neither are they too hardcore nor on the boring side. The movie starts with life on Krypton.In few intervals looks into flashback depicting growth of Kal-EL/Clark into SuperMan. The background track is just OK. I mean, as compared to Hans Zimmer last batman trilogy, it doesn't match up. The ending is typical NOLAN ending as you see in Inception,TDK and TDKR. I would say it is a perfect IMAX 3D must watch. SuperMan has just begun!!",
        "Okay forgive the lame pun, it really was good. What I particularly liked was that it wasn't the traditional Superman movie (to explain that I'll have to add spoilers so I'll leave you to find out yourself). All I'll say is that the story, in true Christopher Nolan style, was a bit, dark \u2013 strange for Superman but it works. I also appreciated the fact that it wasn't told in sequence \u2013 although my mother did not. \"How come one minute he's old, next he's young? This is the same movie? Did you start it over? That's stupid. I'm going to sleep.\" Lol. Don't use that as a benchmark though, she's slept through the best of movies... (continued on blog)\n\nRead the rest of my non-spoiler review: http://goo.gl/uQqzz",
        "the day i went for \"man of steel\" i didn't knew that superman would become my favorite character............after seeing the trailers i was excited....this is one of the best movies of 2013 and the background music is awesome.........the main reason for me liking this film is its background music and well taken shots.........henry cavill is the superman we have been waiting for......3D was good but there was no enough 3D sequences in the film......that ain't a problem......showing the past in between the present was a good technique as they don't have to show it whole as a flashback.....anyway its a good reboot to superman series",
        "I am a hard core sci-fi fan, not to mention super hero type of movies. Considering its budget is 225 k, scenes are shot beautifully, effects are there, fights amazing and everything looks great. But considering the amount of material they had to work with to put it into one movie, and everything that goes with it, i didn't like it. It seems like scenes are just thrown one on top of the other, especially in the beginning of the movie and it looks like there are several movies with the same actors. Beginning back up story also needed its own back up story. Like i said there is a lot of material to work with and I'm surprised they didn't do better job putting it together. I just tend to get lost trying to figure out \"why is this happening in the movie and why that, and what is this\" etc. Overall i gave it 6/10 just cause of my fanatic side for the sci-fi and super heroes, and also beautiful looks. Actors were great. Henrry did awesome job. Only one i didn't quite like is Kals mom. Thought her acting is a bit see through.",
        "The dialogue is wooden, preachy, self-important, and silly. I pictured the actors trying to keep from laughing or wincing at the words they had to say. A lot of the lines are written as if they are supposed to be Big Pieces of Wisdom but they are anything but. Lois Lane is reduced a damsel in distress waiting around for Stuporman (he is so DULL) to save her. They have no chemistry. Despite the big names, there isn't much acting in it because the special effects are supposed to keep you occupied. I thought the CGI, and the costumes, especially on Krypton, were laughable. What acting there is doesn't really uplift the movie much. (I never realized just how bad an actor Kevin Costner is.) Amy Adams comes across as a little girl trying to sound tough and grown-up. I usually enjoy Russell Crowe but for some reason he just wasn't convincing. The movie keeps cutting back and forth so quickly in time and place, with no titles to guide you, that it's hard to keep up with the plot. At the same time, the movie just drags on and on.",
        "Man of Steel: This man lives up to the hype!He is hell bent on protecting human race and engages in absorbing battles on probably all skyscrapers in US. Nonlinear screenplay impresses, so does the Inspiring performances by Cavill and Russell Crowe, blending perfectly with their on screen avatars.Visual effects are amazingly good and the background score is perfectly in sync with the tone of the movie. However there is an overdose of action towards the fag end, which can be slightly tiresome to watch. Overall it is a great entertainer that is worth your time and money.By the way, If there is one thing which Steel lacks, it is the charisma of Iron.",
        "Come on people. This was not a bad movie. I'm really critical on films and I still thought this was easily an 8 or 9 out of 10. The acting was pretty good (not great, however), the action sequences were very impressive and the direction of the film and menace of the villain were quite noteworthy. Seems to me that Christopher Nolan (Producer of the film) always brings a lot of dark overtones to the table when he has a hand in a film, which I like! The truth is, this movie is good summer fun packed with action, adventure, peril and, in my opinion, a worthy portrayal of Superman. Go out and at least see it once and don't enter the movie with hate before you've seen it because I feel like a lot of people are doing that, which isn't fair at all. Looking forward to the sequel when it comes out in the future!!",
        "The movie in spite of having a story told and retold a number of times before, wonderfully depicts the life of super-man. Even though it lacks breath taking sequences, as I expected ,had enough and more to glue me onto my seat.It lacks romance but depicts the hero more as a 'family man' searching the purpose of his life. And as any other super hero movie right from 'Transformers' to 'Dark Knight' it took a lot of effort from the hero to convince his mates that he is not their enemy and was actually fighting the evil rather than being evil himself. Speaking of direction, except the lengthy special effect sequence in the second half the movie was largely refreshing, and a wonderful casting adds to our over all experience. Justice wont be done if I am closing this review without commenting about the work of Zimmer. Once again he gave us what we expected from him.",
        "first of all I don't really understand the hate about it. I mean are you being mean when you give it just a 59% rating. are you crusading the guy by giving it a lesser rating than superman returns. I don't hate superman returns but I think man of the steel is way better than it. I mean is it only me or do people misunderstand Zack Snyder and his films.\n\nI mean if you look closely watchmen it's a very deep movie but only if you can understand it. man of steel is not that. its not complicated. it's a bit dry may drag a little bit but its f-ing good movie. yeah its better than superman returns. and yes it's a 2d movie no need for 3d. it may not be good as the dark knight trilogy but it way better than the other superman movies.",
        "after seeing the movie I am just speechless & entranced. A action packed mind blowing story makes me feel high.Henry cavil is the best superman in approach. Great graphics work....realistic 3D effect makes it much more catchy. All the casts effectively put their acting skills in a proper manner. Steel really put behind iron & whole avengers team. After a long waiting the world are going to see the real big daddy....it's not smallvile nor superman returns....it's the man of steel with humanity....the superman. The movie is released for a reason....to thrash the record breaking crown of iron man. The plot was promising & slightly with remark of dark knight trilogy. But you can enjoy this serious approach of superman. More earthly....more realistic touch with the symbol 'S'....Hope we can see another sequel of this movie. Justice league is waiting!!",
        "After watching this movie in 3D i thought that this is what i wanted from a movie.man of steel has perfect blend in screenplay and casting which is the main reason for failure of previous superman movies although the story remains same.\n\nI got worried when the superman venture has fallen in the hands of Zack Snyder who barely had two mediocre movies and less experience when compared to any superhero director.But he made the movie without any pitfalls which is quite common in superman,he has shown the overview of his birth and krypton's destruction in enthralling way.Henry Cavil is the best choice and he lived in the role of normal human and as superman(credits to his suit).The background score by Hans Zimmer should be given a special mention.\n\nThe final showdown i.e the last one hour would be like a roller coaster ride.",
        "man of steel is an epic. henry cavill is the perfect superman breath taking stunts are sure to rock the audience. This super man is better than all other super heroes he super strength is a big assest,,, the production values are un compromised, production values can b seen on screen,, nolan done a decent job Our director zack snyder once again repeated the magic very beautiful movie,, though there is nothing but destruction in d movie,it will rock u for sure we watch super hero movies to see super man giving his opponent left and right this guys also flys better than the previous supermans,,,his stronge leap quakes the earth, lasers from the r no exception,, henry cavill is perfect fit, so is general zod",
        "From the beginning till the end, the whole movie was full of action. It did get a bit of a drag in the middle when it seemed that they added the extra action to prolong the movie. Overall, if you are looking for a movie that is a combination of action, a bit of humor and romance, then this is a good watch. However, if you are someone with a delicate soul, then you might want to avoid this movie, ha ha. It is just too intense and noisy. I had fun watching it in IMAX 3D. The 3D effects were awesome. The sci-fi effects were really interesting. Amy Adams and Christopher Meloni make a very good couple in this movie. Christopher Meloni's acting as super man is really remarkable.",
        "I loved he Man Of Steel. There may be a little bit of too much action and How he killed Zod was a little bit weak but it had a great storyline and it had the best action ever! I recommend this movie to all Marvel fans to see how awesome DC really is.\n\nThe trailers were all awesome! Thats why i really wanted to see this movie. Henry Cavill was an awesome superman! ( so was Christopher Reeve ) Russell was also a great For being supes dad. If i had to compare this to Iron Man 3, Iron Man 3 would get a 6/10 and Man of Steel would get a 8.5/10\n\nIn conclusion i really think that the Man Of Steel Was great and i think it deserves a 9/10",
        "I don't usually use this word for film, usually for girls, but this film was breath taking. The film is excellent, the music was epic, the fights were awesome, the special effects are 2X better than Avatar ( Avatar is still very good) , the acting was great as well as the casting..... really this film blew my head off, I am sad to hear around me people complaining its too ACTION... what did they expect ? Superman playing monopoly with the villains? Too sci-fi! What ... cause the other films weren't ? If a man can fly.. its already sci-fi, how can you make it more sci-fi?! Not enough romance and discovery of his powers... People please, how many superman film have we got to watch or TV series to know this ?? I say thank you and bravo to Zack Snyder , Christopher Nolan and the whole team for bringing this spectacular film on the screens. ...ps if you need extras for the next one , give me a call :D A.H.2.V",
        "If your a comic book fan or just have a thing for superhero movies this movie won't let you down. The fights are done perfectly and the special effects are top notch. Do yourself a favor, see this movie soon. Unlike the severe disappointment I felt after seeing Iron man 3 this movie left me feeling amped up for some more skyscraper toppling fight scenes.\n\nThe cast was well thought out, both of superman's dads gave great performances. Not to mention setting up some possibilities for sequel ideas while not committing to any one idea like most movies of this kind tend to do.",
        "Man of Steel is everything a fan can expect from a Superman movie. This story is a fresh new take on the character Kal-El and combines elements of Golden Age, Silver Age, and modern age Superman stories. Prior to Infinite Crisis of Two Earths, DC's run on the comics was a complete mess with stories of the Justice League of America and other characters such as Flash, Wonder Woman, etc. not following any sort of time line continuity. Despite many comparing this movie to Christopher Reeve's version (R.I.P) Superman's origin story had been told by writers time and time again in comics and this version gets it right. This movie does a great job at nailing the source material and creating a coherent story and movie experience. Man of Steel is the Superman movie for this generation and retells the story of Kal-El the way it was meant to be told.",
        "Many people have already given rave reviews for this outstanding reboot of Superman's Origin. This version has definitely benefited from the CGI & used it as we would imagine how powerful Superman is. The execution of this entire movie from start to finish is something to behold and for me, that is in the future, holding a 3D copy. From heartfelt to the most amazing punches ever seen! I am a fan of all comics, be it marvel or DC. I enjoyed Avengers last year but was disappointed with Dark Knight Rises. In most people's eyes, The Dark Knight, was the Batman movie of all time..... The Man of Steel, is the Superman movie that has made me believe that Zack Snyder has done a Brilliant job in reminding us that Superman, is the most powerful & GREATEST hero of all time. Watch it and you shall believe it. I plan to watch this again at least another 3 times. 10/10",
        "Ill be watching this on the weekend.\n\n1. I do think it would have been good to have the John Williams music somewhere if nothing other than paying homage. What do people think? In my opinion it is a timeless piece and not corny and I think it can work even in a modern rebooted Superman due to its ability to lift the audience. Just needs to be introduced at exactly the right time...I would say towards the end. Any views?\n\n2. Also, I get doing away with red underpants, but why do away with the hair curl/cowlick?\n\n3. Im all for a reboot and think Sups more than anyone needs it. Perhaps Im still reminiscing about the Reeves era. On that note, do people think Reeves is to Super man what Sean Connery is to Bond??",
        "Can believe superman returns has a higher rating than Man of Steel, Just goes to show what critics on rotten tomatoes know. This is without doubt the best superman movie ever, amazing action scenes, amazing story, yes its quite dark compared to other superman movie but thats what makes it so good, great start to the movie and the action scenes are amazing. Henry Cavill plays a great superman and Michael Shannon's performance as general Zod was amazing. Zack Snyder has done an amazing job creating one of the best superhero movies ever. a must see for all comic book fans and mover fans in general, hopefully this opens up the DC comic universe",
        "This movie is astonishing on the action and origin story telling part but lacks certain character development, which in turn would make this movie a master piece.So i say don't listen to the critics on rotten tomatoes and go and see the movie for yourself because in my opinion it is the summer movies block buster of the year! you'll have fun with it and it will make you feel like a superman fan again. this by far is one of the best superman films I've ever seen and almost tops the first Christopher Reeve one, but i'm not looking to compare. Action-packed, briskly-paced and featuring a stellar cast, Man of Steel is the best Superman film since the 1978 original and proves DC can match Marvel in the massive scale department. While it could have used a bit more levity, Man of Steel is nevertheless director Zack Snyder's best film to date.",
        "first review, and because i was so frustrated. this movie sucks big time. Maybe little ones and very low expectation people will enjoy it, but average people, let alone comic fans, will dread the absurd plot line, the cheesy dialogue and the absolute poor character development. This movie makes Howard The Duck and all the Hulks look like Shakespeare material in comparation. No matter the Fx, the great Music (the only magnificent here) and the actors names, this is sooooo bad, lame and shameful. Nowhere near the Batman movies, and even it got the same writers, this was a lazy script work. Boring and almost stupid, this is not even TV material and time will put it to rest next to Superman Returns. Same low level.",
        "Snyder had a great story from Nolan and Goyer to work with. And he did a great job. Movie gets a grip on you. In these days, when visual effects are no longer surprise, only emotional and touching story can impact the viewer. The film is deep and full of spiritual symbols, which are not too hard to understand...\n\nCast is nothing but amazing. Russel is a legend and perfect as Superman's father. Henry Cavill did amazing job. He fits well in the role. Flashbacks to the childhood are awesome, especially with actors of that caliber for Clark's parents. Nicely done.\n\nTruly a deep and epic movie. Man of Hope is alive and pictured well in this Superman movie. Would definitely wanna see it again.",
        "Overall, this was a fairly good movie. I guess I am a fan of Marvel, but I did enjoy some of the older Superman movies, and I think that's kind of why this one was a little disappointing, to me at least. If you are a lover of action-packed movies, this is DEFINITELY a good choice for you. There were a lot of really cool action scenes in the movie. However, personally I thought that some of the action caused there to be less emphasis on character and plot development. If you are looking for a well developed story line, you may not enjoy this as much, but like I said, superhero movies are a lot about the action, and you should definitely see it!",
        "Man of steel is the reinvention and new definition of the beloved superhero known as Superman, the movie is directed by Zach Snyder who also did 300, Watchmen and the painful crashing fantasy Sucker Punch. However this movie is a new approach for both the director and the rebooted franchise. Man of steel does show the origins of superman and his people known as Kryptonians.\n\nMan of steel is a beautiful action film, with a great story, maybe not a fantastic story but definitely better than the Marvel's Avengers story line. Here we see a new side of superman which make it a bit realistic and gives him more character of a human and Kryptonian.\n\nA great fun summer blockbuster with a story that everyone can enjoy.",
        "Man of Steel was definitely a very entertaining movie and the movie is made in order for the whole family to enjoy it! You always keep your eyes open while you are watching the movie, you just cant lose a moment because you are too into the movie. I am a Marvel fan and even though this movie is very different from the Marvel material, you should see it! Henry Cavill knows how to portrait a great superhero even with his looks.\n\nOn the dark side, the movie is exaggerated with some action -- the way superman destroys everything. They could have used half of the crashes and the movie would have been better. The movie also contains some clich\u00e9s but it is entertaining. Man of Steel is not the movie of the year or the best movie you have ever seen but it is definitely an entertaining movie which wont get you bored, not even a minute.",
        "The movie was the epic in it's own by DC.Seriously among all the super- heroes movie we had seen was just like \"tea without sugar\". The cgi & VFX was marvelous.Not at a single scene seems fake.Movie makes us believe each and every scene of the movie. Unforgettable movie of 2013.According to me David S. Goyer(Scripting) & Zack Snyder(Directing)bakes the movie superbly & marvelously. If you want to see the massive and effective movie you should go for it. And yeah..if you are cgi lover you should go for it. All i wanna say's that Superman- MAN OF STEEL was really a man of steel. Hat's off to the Director,Actors,and last but the main was the GRAPHICS.",
        "Just came back from IMAX3D tonight at my country's time.This is my 2nd time of watching it and it is getting better and better with each viewing,. A beautifully crafted, epic visions, out of this earth battles and all but also induced with emotional context and underlying themes with so much positive vibes and messages of courage, tolerance, hope, trust, love and sacrifice.\n\nThank you can't be enough words for Zack, Goyer, Nolan, Henry, Amy, Shannon, Russell, Kevin, Dianne, Antje, Ayelet Zurer and every other casts and dozens of filmmakers!!! Thanks for bringing back the first and greatest hero right where he belong! Long live the King!!!! Superman is here to stay to inspired us to be a force of good 9/10.",
        "Man of Steel was Awesome. But one NOTE: Don't stay after the credit's....no preview or after credit hint. The credits just end. This may not sound like a big deal. But after most \"Super Hero,\" movies these after credit preview 'hint,' have become important to me. Its expected, and not just for me as about 50 people stayed and waited after the credits for such a thing.\n\nAlso, I feel they over edited the movie, perhaps cut 30 minutes out...some of it was to cut and paste. Which for me took away from the flow of the movie, some of it perhaps the timing didn't sit right with me.\n\nBut over all awesome! Must watch in theater, great action and graphics. Antje Traue may be over looked but I thought her role as Faora-Ul was bad-ass.",
        "I went to see this movie with high expectations....I was not disappointed. The movie was absolutely fantastic and the visuals were spellbinding. Im a huge marvel fan but this movie is freaking great. Had immense joy coming out and discussing it with my dad (by the way he loved it to). Now honestly I don't know what movie the critics were watching because I thought i had the best story and origin out of all the Superman's. Way better than Donners version. The action was great and final we get to see superman kick some ass. The only complaint would be that I feel the casting could have been better for Lois lane. The connection between superman and her was just not right. I cant explain, you will just have to see for your self. Otherwise it was awesome and I 100% recommend you go see it.",
        "Atlast Superman got what he deserved..A brilliant film which his audience could remember forever..Many films on Superman have been made before but none of them could create spark among audiences..Thanks to Zack Snyder and Nolan for giving us such a beautifully and well crafted movie. So what the movie lacks in humor and romantic quotient(according to critics)..Snyder always gives emphasis on the CGI and story in his every film and critics have to understand that a superhero like Superman has always been serious character whether it is in comics or films and it really suits him. About the lack of romance..Well wait for the sequel guys :) :)\n\nMusic by Hans zimmer , which could easily give you goosebumps!! ..Superb acting by all of the casts but man who really STEALS the show is \"The Man Of Steel\" Henry Cavill. 10/10",
        "one of the best movies of this and all times, it is difficult to make a superhero movie that has serious tone and not just romp and jokes. It shows the human side of Kar-El, in trying to be just one of us, but his fate will prepare something bigger \"The ultimate hero of humanity\".\n\nIt shows a Clark who suffer the consequences of being different, their emotions, their feelings. Facing decisions between who he is or who he should be.\n\nThe cast was amazing, everything fit to perfection: Henry Cavill, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe, Amy Adams, Antje Traue, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne ..\n\nThe music is beautiful and powerful Indisputably 10/10 Movie",
        "Screw the critics and the people that want to see this movie fail, this movie is what i have been waiting to see as a Superman. I was scared when i went in but after five minutes of the movie my fears disappeared and i just enjoyed it. Honestly Henry Cavill was Clark Kent and Amy Adams gave Lois Lane the feisty spirit she had been missing in the previous incarnations. To me this movie had a great plot, music, good amount of romance, action, visuals, and heart. There is a lot of action but what did you expect....ITS SUPERMAN.....I heard people complained for so long that Superman never unleashes his full strength, well he finally does in this movie and its glorious. Go see it, you will not be disappointed. I give it a 9.5/ 10",
        "Action and graphic wise, this movie is beyond amazing. However, this movie was way too long for it's story(1/3 of the scenes in 143 minutes were very unnecessary). This is not the first time I felt this way about Zack Snyder movie. Zack Snyder is amazing director with very unique sense of graphics and shots, but he is not a good storyteller to keep audience interested throughout his movie. Every single one of his movies feels like he doesn't know where to cut the scenes(he always drags the scenes and stories beyond necessity). It would be much better if the movie was shorter and faster because this movie did have great story and scenes, but Zack Snyder's slow storytelling gave this movie some setbacks. So when you walk in the theater, you shouldn't expect anything other than another Zack Snyder movie.",
        "After watching the trailer, I didn't have high hopes for the movie. I thought it will be like any other superhero movie where we assume of what his/her superpowers are and role he/she would be going to play. But, Voila!! I was taken aback by the way movie depicted Superman; it clearly shows the origin of Superman, his lack of strength in start(yes, everyone have some weakness, isn't it?), and it delivers all this circumspectly that I was left glued to the movie screen.\n\nIn addition, the action sequences, cinematography, and special effects never looked out of the scope of the movie; the action scenes contributed to the story with congruity. I insist you to watch this movie, as it will blow your mind away!",
        "Overall Movies is AWESOME.....You will love the treatment given to this movie especially content...I read mixed reviews on internet, sorry to say folks Movie isn;t bad as reviews...\n\nCasting is outclass with power packed performance...first 60mins of the movie is touching and brings out character of superman at later half..Graphic, presentation are simply brilliant\n\nClimax fight should have been reduced by 5 mins..Not to forget this is a trilogy planned by franchise and we can expect more humor in sequels...\n\nFull Marks to David S. Goyer, Henry Cavill, & Zack Snyder,,,,\n\nI recommend everyone TO GO and Watch....Man of Steel is a Movie with Heart & Soul...",
        "Most of the critics have been wrong. They all seem to want the goof-ball Superman of old. This Superman is complex. Great action, great story, and a great all around experience. You must see this movie at least once, twice is recommended though.\n\nIf you are looking for a Christopher Reeves or the dead beat dad Brandon Routh played you will not like Man of Steel. If you are looking for a fresh take on Superman, this is your movie. There are great little references to the DC Universe throughout. It seems like a Justice League movie is possible in the carefully created universe of Man of Steel (yay!) I am already ready for the second Man of Steel movie.",
        "As i have not seen the original super man movies i can not compare it to the others but if i were to compare it to other super heroes now a days it was a good movie and i would put it up there as one of my favorite superhero movies.the cgi in this movie was very good for the first time ever an explosion made with cgi was actually good and looked real.It has a good story line and will make you ask questions.It also has a good (maybe be a spoiler it doesn't tell you anything though) it has a very good twist at the end which will leave you at the edge of your seat.The acting in it is very good and superman was played very well but not only him but lots of other people in the movie.It might not have fight sciences every second but when it does have one it will be an epic battle hope you like the movie.",
        "Zack Snyder became my favorite director after \"Watchmen\" and \"SuckerPunch\" for his moments of mesmerizing, dreamlike style. Clearly that director didn't show up on the Man of Steel set. It seemed like he wanted to take his directorial style in a different direction, and that's okay, but it looked like almost the entire move was shot shaky-cam handlheld style. I can accept that for \"wartime\" action scenes, but to shoot everything that way, even the more poignant, thoughtful moments, was too much. Way too much. But perhaps it's just me, since I've heard no one else complain about this. Do we accept this now as the way Hollywood shoots movies for dramatic effect? Otherwise, the film took Superman in a new direction - 'Stranger in a Strange Land', coming to grips with his identity, but still provided enough homage to the original source material and even to the Christopher Reeves era for older fans to enjoy. If you don't look for plot holes, inconsistencies and 'convenient structuring', you'll enjoy it.",
        "Do not go to cinema expecting a Reeve's movie or a fail tribute like \"Returns\", Man Of Steel have self identity, it's not another version from 80's movies of Superman, it's just the most faithful adaption movie from Superman and Action Comics.\n\nMan Of Steel have one of the better CGI what i already see in my life, insane fights in the Dragon Ball Z Style (showing a perfect battle of gods in a city whats falling in pieces in every punch) and a great screenplay of a man who tries to find his place in the world.\n\nThe classic soundtrack could be missed, but the new by Zimmer, it's good too, and combines more with the movie style/rhythm.\n\nMan of Steel couldn't be the better comic book movie ever, but it's the better super hero origins movie and the better Superman movie ever.",
        "This movie had a sporadic storyline it kept jumping from one scene to another and not following one smooth story, finding it hard to keep track as to what was going on. The character depth and acting was mediocre; I felt like the actors just said there roles assigned to their character and that there was a absence of emotion and excitement in each of the characters in the film. However,the cinematography was simply amazing and show how great the technology is heading these days, the action scenes were exhilarating and exciting to watch. All in all a 7.5/10 movie, I would only recommend this movie to you if you wanted to watch a good action movie and weren't bothered about the storyline. .",
        "I was never a big Superman guy considering all the other Superman movies were not too pleasing. I went to the premier of this movie expecting it to be decent considering Christopher Nolan produced it. Right from the start this movie was full of action. I think that most people expected an action pact movie because a lot of Zack Snyder's films are like this. The reason I didn't give this a 8 or a 9 was because some of the action was pointless. I thought that the flash backs about Clark's childhood was a good piece to the movie. Most the characters did a good job except the person who played superman was as boring as dry paint. Also, I would've liked to see more romance between Clark and Lois. I think that Russel Crow played a cool character and it was nice to see a different villain rather than Lex Luthor. If you like superhero movies and u want to be on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film than this is the right choice for you.",
        "Explosions and more explosions. Basically the whole movie. And almost 0 character development. Still rather entertaining to watch but it's not no where near great. The Dark Knight trilogy puts this to shame. If you want to watch a fun action flick this is the movie for you but if you want a movie with a good story pass on this. The movie needed a better story and a lot of the parts were cheesy. Spoilers: Why was superman actually upset he just killed an evil guy in order to save a family? Why was that a hard decision? Moments like these make me want to cringe. This is movie very overrated. It seems like another michael bay movie. This is superman, give it an actual story please.",
        "The worst film I've watched this year. There is no proper story, just random events throughout which seem generally unrelated. I found myself not really caring who won or lost in any of the battles going on. If you love Superman and have done since you were a child (or still are a child), you might get something out of this, but if you compare it to any other recent superhero film, this lags a long long way behind, even behind Marvels Formula of changing out the superhero and keeping the rest of the plot of the film the same and re-releasing it. I shall remember this film for a long time for how horrific it was and hope to never have to watch it again.",
        "Hi there, Frankly speaking, the movie as an action movie is awesome. However, as a superman movie, it is a little disappointing for missing some of the signatures those were engraved in our minds since we were children about superman movies, for example; The Original soundtrack was so awesome (Well, was missing), The keyword \"Superman\" as part of the title is missing this is why I did not watch the movie since 2013 till 2016 because all that time I thought it is something related to iron-man or real steel or such. I do not want to be a detail- oriented, So I really hope they bring back at least these two missing items for the incoming episodes of the Superman franchise. The Movie action is a 10/10, really awesome. The New version of the Superman Uniform, is Super Awesome. The physical shape of Superman, Well, for my opinion, I think is a little over shaped (Lol, not sure if this is even a used term \"Over shaped\") what I mean by, the Shoulder Muscles look somehow too huge for the body!! My overall evaluation for the movie is 7/10, and the 3 marks were taken for the two missing items.",
        "I didn't know what to expect while arriving at the IMAX theater near me. I know that Christopher Nolan told such a great, dark, exciting story with the Batman set... With that said and from all of the trailers, I expected something close to the same. While IMAX is supposed to give you a complete movie-going experience, I must say that my brother and I were blown away!!! I found myself saying \"Oh My God\" time and time again.I was hanging on the edge of my seat and jumping while the fighting scenes. Christopher Nolan continued his success and has made me place the crown atop the head of The Best movie for 2013...The Man Of Steel!!!I do not want to give anything away, but towards the end of the movie when things come to a head..You will say \"OH Sh*T\" with the rest of the theater GO WATCH THIS!!! IMAX $20.50, WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!",
        "I think, this is best superhero movie, the musics, the scenes are greattt",
        "I love that they gave a tribute to Christopher Reeve. A good way to show respect."
