{"reviews": ["Great movie, which serves as a perfect introduction to Tony Stark's character. The antagonist was a bit boring, but except for that, I loved the movie!", "Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a hard playing billionaire genius. He is captured in Afghanistan after demonstrating his newest weapon. He is forced to create new weapons for his captor. Instead he makes an armored suit to escape. He also makes an arc reactor to keep his heart going and shrapnel from killing him. Once back in the States, he moves his company to concentrate on arc reactor technology and stop weapons manufacturing.\n\nThis is all RDJ. He and he alone makes Iron Man work. It's doubtful if anybody could have done it better. It's certain that he's made it next to impossible to replace him. Director Jon Favreau has built around him the dazzling array of tech fun, and Gwyneth Paltrow as his Girl Friday. It is RDJ's fast talking, quick wit, and personal history that makes him the perfect Tony Stark. Great character, fun movie.", "Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies. It's based off the popular Marvel comics. On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better. I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better. Tony Stark, a popular weapons company owner gets kidnapped by a cult called \"Ten Rings\" in the Middle East. They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. I also liked Terrence Howard as Rhodey. The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies. The plot has its share of intriguing twists. I believe that this Iron Man is original, but that is my opinion. I rate this movie 10/10.", "Probably 3 times when I watched this movie where it all started. Even though I'm a Marvel fan, of course basically just on the movie and series side, I won't let that affect the ratings, though.\n\nAfter all, this great movie is about anyway. And there is no shame technically in the movie universe for the latest movies. This isn't perfect, but it's quite functional in everything, I guess I wouldn't have looked at it any more times.", "As an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, I was excited but also very scared that this movie would flop.\n\nWhile Robert Downey is not the biggest name in Hollywood, he plays the part perfectly and I was greatly impressed by how he portrayed Iron Man so well.\n\nThe humor works well for this film also. It's well-written and has a great cast.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the CGI! They're breath-taking, but aren't distracting enough to let you miss the finer points of this movie.\n\nIn conclusion, while not perfect, Iron Man lives up to its hype and my expectations as a reader of the comic.", "This in my opinion is the best of the super hero movies. I was never into Ironman comics but this movie made me a fan. It has great pacing and lots of action. The build up of the characters is good, at least enough that you care to see what happens to them.\n\nThis is a great movie that is worthy of rewatching. I was sad to see how quickly the hero franchise went downhill but at least I will always have this one to fall back on.", "I am far to be fan of comics. or Marvel universe. and , maybe, for an action film, I prefer Batman more than Ironman who, I admitt, was unknow for me before this film. the only motif to see the film was Robert Downey jr. and it is a serious motif. because, for an outsider, \"Ironman\" is real...cool. for humour, performances, meet between Jeff Bridges and Robert Downey, story, references to many episodes from superheroes adventures and, sure, but less, for CGI effects. it is part of a trend proposing its voice. with succes. and that defines it. so, enjoy it !", "Well here we start, I always was a fan of Marvel so when \"Iron Man\" came out in cinemas I went and saw it. I think \"Iron Man\" is the best of movie of this trilogy maybe because was the first and it starts this trilogy. I also think that the two others which followed has lost this kind of magic that had the first one.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. made on of his best interpretations in this movie played as Iron Man and Tony Stark. I think the selection of him was the point of culmination together with the visual effects of the movie and the plot.\n\nFinally I want to tell you that Marvel has to show us more than this and we have to expect more from them. Future will show us, we need to be patient for it...", "The first. It still holds up 13 years after release. The I am Iron Man ending is fantastic of course, as is the acting, the plot, and everything else, I don't really have much to say except for the fact that the movie was great", "Who knew that the first MCU film would remain its best? It has a surprising amount of character depth, a gradual pacing, exciting action and grounded setting. It also has a compelling emotional core. As far as blockbusters go, this is one of the best I've seen.", "The faltering babysteps of the ginormous MCU lie in this deeply uneven late noughties superhero venture. Downey Jr is, of course, a charismatic presence but he eats too much screen time and literally no one else gets a look-in or any real motivation. The crass boyish sexism and heavy-handed \"vague terrorist group\" have dated appallingly but the suit is the star and the sleek Stan Winston/ILM fusion still feels vibrant. It's definitely a mixed bag rather than a strong foundation but the building blocks are there and the weight of where it all leads lends it a far more tolerable aspect.", "Lets face it. Iron Man is not the most famous of comic superheroes. In fact, up until now I had only head about it briefly. I also found out that it was from Marvel and since I love Spiderman so much I decided I would go and check it out. Wow! This movie is awesome!. Acting is great and I am so happy to see Gwyneth Paltrow back in the movie business after a while. Robert Downey junior was also really good as the sleazy millionaire turned superhero. The villain was great (i forget his name) and Terrence Howard was great as well. The action and visual effects were really good and the movies talk on terrorism is very intriguing. Overall, a great movie. I think Marvel should be very pleased.", "Iron Man (2008, Dir. Jon Favreau)\n\nWhilst taken hostage, Tony Stark builds a suit. This will not only protect him, but will defeat his opponents. Back home, Stark continues work on this technological advanced suit and is soon put to the test to defeat the ultimate enemy.\n\nExplosive and exciting action filled 'Iron Man' is not only a spectacular introduction to the comic book hero but is also a superb return for Robert Downey Jr. Downey is born to play Tony Stark, with a great supporting cast and amazing visual effects. One of the biggest hits of 2008, Iron Man will keep you stuck to the film from star to finish.\n\nThe future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned? I'll tell you in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot's instinct. \u2013 Rhodey (Terrence Howard)", "First of all, Iron Man is truly awesome! Every scene was great and there was almost no boring parts in the movie. Iron Man is the best out of the three. Iron Man 2 was boring and Iron Man 3 was just disappointing.\n\nIron Man was a part where the Marvel Cinematic Universe began. And yes, it was a good start. But the sad part is the last 2 movies left a legacy of mediocrity.\n\nAt least it had the chance to redeem itself through the movie The Avengers. Maybe, Iron Man would redeem itself again on Avengers Age Of Ultron.\n\nIn conclusion, Iron Man was great! A good start to the franchise and the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe.", "Iron Man is an incredible origin movie and superb start to the M.C.U. that's funny, stylish and thrilling. Robert Downey Jr. gives a perfect lead performance and Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrance Howard are both great. Jeff Bridges is also great despite limited depth. Jon Favreau's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and superbly paced. The CG is incredible and the music by Ramin Djawadi is excellent.", "Brilliant start to MCU, Robert Downey jr was perfect to play Tony Stark and the movie was really good with a good story and great build up. Perfect start to the marvel world we know and love. Watching them from the start again so will be reviewing each one as i get through them.", "Rdj is one of my favourite actor.\n\nIt's an amazing film and it's the first of the marvel cinematic universe. There are many twists and action scenes.", "There's something I like to call 'the Sherlock effect'. It basically says that Sherlock Holmes is a genius is is not allowed to be wrong ever. It's how they explain some (or most) of the things he does. It's quite a lazy way to go about the plot, but Robert Downey Jr. is such a phenomenal actor that I let it slide. And the same thing can be said about Tony Stark being everything all at once to everybody. No human could ever handle all that, but Tony Stark is more than human, and combine that with RDJr. to get the perfect person. Not perfect in that he has no flaws, but perfect in that you see past them and accept him for who he is, no matter what crazy things he does.\n\nAll this talking can be summarized by me saying that RDJr. is brilliant and amazing in whatever he does and that this movie is completely worth it. I hope that many more are made.", "Robert Downey Jr. Does a fantastic job playing this character and making it his own. The movie delivers an amazing plot from start to finish with interesting characters. The only problem with this movie in my opinion was the very weakly written villain and the final battle.", "Another movie to glamorize America.\n\nWhat would we do without America as the good guys? While it had decent effects and everything seemed kinda fun, it relied upon the overall effect of America the strong and good and saviour and that other nationalities are sub-par.\n\nThe bad guys this time are in Afghanistan.\n\nYeah America - hero's to the world...all hail government propaganda.\n\nI never read the Iron Man comics and most likely never will, so I can't compare the comics to this - but I know what feeding me lies about military and everything it stands for is.", "When I rented this movie, I procrastinated for a week before watching it. I thought, why should I watch yet another superhero movie? Haven't I seen enough of them in my short lifetime? Expecting to be entertained by unimpressed, I decided to watch Iron Man.\n\nThe first thing I noticed right off the bat was the sharp dialog delivered by the excellent main actor. It was witty, crisp, and not lacking in the least. When I watch a movie, lame dialog is one of the worst things a movie can inflict upon me. Another thing I hate is bad CGI, and this movie had none of that. They pulled out all the stops on this one.\n\nI recommend this movie highly, especially if you enjoy really cool explosions. Explosions are an art form, people, and this movie is a work of genius.", "Man! I don't believe it's too overrated but still...\n\nOK we start the movie with Tony Stark, a multimillionaire playboy, alcoholic, weapon making genius. He's not carrying what happens until something comes about that changes his mind and makes him make a super suite to combat world terror. Thus Iron Man was born.\n\nThis is yet another great action film with predictable plot and a big fight at the end. Comic book fans will like this movie as it is fairly accurate to the story of Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent with the part of Tony Stark I doubt it could have been played better. The only downer of this movie is the fact that it's still just another blockbuster with predictable plot but I'm fine for more of the same but it won't get above an 8 no matter how cool it looks or is acted out.", "I have to state, that I'm not an avid comic(graphic novel) book reader, so I can't point out any differences between the written (or drawn) world and the real (filmed) world. But I know that this movie was a lot of fun and it seems to owe many things to Batman Begins ... beginning with an ensemble cast!\n\nBut the main actor here is of course Robert Downey Jr. If you have followed his career & private life (some ups, unfortunately many \"downs\" too, no pun intended), you have to be real happy seeing him getting recognized for his talent and finally beginning to explore his (acting) abilities and being confident enough to play major roles. This is apparent through the screen/his acting. He is very comfortable (not only because of the \"support\" cast, that ... supports him, Terence Howard, Gwyneth P. and Jeff B.) and this helps elevate the movie! It is fun & light, but with an honest message/warning (just like Mr. Downey himself)", "I went to see \"Iron Man\" knowing nothing about the character (never read the comic books) and without great expectations. I'm a big Robert Downey Jr. fan and if not for his presence, I probably would've ignored it. I didn't like it as much as most people, but it was fairly entertaining (and that's what I was expecting after all, we're not talking about groundbreaking film-making here and I don't think anybody expects that from this, right?) and that's mostly thanks to Downey Jr., one of the coolest actors out there, a chameleon who can play pretty much everything. Adding to the \"cool\" aspect of the movie, Jeff Bridges plays the villain. I'm glad that the long, dark phase of drug abuse Downey Jr. was living some years ago is over, and the man is alive and kicking to continue delighting audiences. Plus, \"Iron Man\" will introduce him to a whole new generation. Don't expect much and enjoy the ride; better a summer flick with Robert Downey Jr. than a dozen Michael Bays starring bland new \"stars\" and tanned Angelina Jolie wannabes. 7/10.", "This has been billed as a smarter, tighter super hero movie. It's not. It's entertaining, and has all the special effects one takes for granted, but it is still riddled with the same old clich\u00e9s expected from the genre. I had hoped that the movie would stay more in Afghanistan - anywhere but Calipornia - but it gets bogged down as soon as Iron Man does his one piece of obligatory super hero rescuing the average guys from evildoers, and returns to the usual (yawn) struggle with evil corporate magnates determined to make more money and stoke the ego incarnate.\n\nThe audience I saw it with clapped and cheered and laughed, and I take it that the average movie goer joe is happy with being treated once again to mindless escapism for the summer. My grandkids liked it, and what else can one ask from Hollywood."]}
