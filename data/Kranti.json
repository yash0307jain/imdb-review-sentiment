        "Review By Kamal K\n\nMovie is nice entertainer I enjoyed songs acting direction was good enough according to those times.",
        "Great film with great songs. Have been humming the songs since watching it - check out www.dishant.com.\n\nSaw it when i was young, and bought back a couple of memories, vaguely remember the film but you can never forget the wonderful songs.\n\nThe song, 'Zindagi ki na tote lari' was fantastic and very emotional, especially where the fantastic Hema Malini and Manoj Kumar are on the top deck, all wet and crying their eyes out, the picturisation was amazing and you really felt for both characters.\n\nWhy did Praveen Babi have such a short role in the film? Definitely recommend the film to others.",
        "I just forgotten this film and just listened to the song and started crying \ud83d\ude2d God where did the old Bollywood went",
        "I saw this movie recently as I am on dilip kumar movie list ... All I felt was the quality of prints are bit roughed up..... Rest this movies haa still no match .... Particular kranti .... It's purely cinematic engagement... Too much fiction.. too much of drama and un scientific logics but so convincing performance that you really don't care ... Great cast assembling great charactes... One sud not dare to remake such movie as today we won't find a match of such great actors we lack that talent now ... No one has that real life persona or reel life talent ... Good movie ..."
