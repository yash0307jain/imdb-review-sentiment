        "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
        "A meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.",
        "Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.\n\nRating: 9.6.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.\n\nBut it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.\n\nThis movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios.\n\n10/10",
        "Infinity war is one of the best MCU protects. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again, if you love Marvel, watch this movie.",
        "Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think \"Infinity War\" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in \"Endgame\" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly \"Infinity War\" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.",
        "I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.\n\nAvengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way. It's genuinely a very strong movie, that is deeply rewatchable, and one of the best Space movies ever made.",
        "Infinity war seemed much better than endgame to be honest.",
        "There's no way anyone will be able to beat the Avengers franchise. Perfection in every way!",
        "Avengers Infinity War is an EPIC action film with amazing and fast paced action sequences. From featuring an engrossing story line to an AWESOME villain, this film has it all.",
        "#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.",
        "I love this film, it has the correct balance of all the ingredients. For the people saying this is better than Endgame, I suppose so, but I look at it as a Kill Bill type situation. They are parts one and two of the same film and as such should be viewed as a whole. Infinity war has so much bang for your buck that Endgame if compared it way flatter, but really they are Cause and effect, setup and resolution.\n\nBrilliant, vibrant, funny, highly entertaining and unpredictable stuff.",
        "Such a great storyline! The infinity stones, taking over the world, so intriguing!",
        "One of the best movie I've ever watch. This is probably the most popular superhero movie. This time the Avengers have to face the most powerful and dangerous villain Thanos, who collecting the infinity stones to kill half of the population of universe.\n\nThis movie is perfect in every category. Acting, Visual effects, BGM, direction, carecter development everything is outstanding. And each and every actor done their best performance. There are so many seens that gives me goosebumps, specially Thor's entry seen in Wakanda. I can watch this film millions of time.",
        "This is is the best marvel/avengers movie every minute is very great no cap.",
        "This film knocked it out of the park and will go down in history. Seeing our heroes crossover was done very organically and led to a fun and thrilling path. The story was unpredictable, had an unexpected main character and the ending was perfect.",
        "I enjoyed the movie. Its still the same line story. The Avengers fight against the Vilain and try to win. Tanos is very well made and very impressive to see. The end is pretty surprising and make us wonder what happened to the Heroes in the next movie.",
        "Best Avengers movie, also my fave. Action-packed and way superior to Endgame, which was way too short on the battles. The whole storyline also could've actually been told in a trilogy, instead of the two parter because of the many heroes and interactions. All the characters are great; albeit, I'm partial to Cap, Spidey, Thor, Peter Quill & Gamora, Viz & Wanda--hanz off lolz :0)",
        "One of the Best move from 'MARVEL STUD10S . I Love this excellent work from the whole team. Especially \"Thanos\" and the \" Six Infinity Stone\" .\n\nThe movie includes humour, sentiments, violence, and all the elements that a perfect movie need.\n\n\" A MUST WATCH MOVIE \" .\n\nNB: \" TRY TO WATCH FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS MARVEL UNIVERSE THEN ONLY YOU WILL GET THE CONTINUATION OF THIS EXCELLENT MOVIE \"",
        "My favorite part of the movie was the finale. I do not explain in order not to give Spolier. But it's not just an ordinary finale. I think the Thanos character is good.",
        "This Movie Was Literally Amazing Just No Words Mind Blowing Action And Next Level Story Just Watch This Movie. You will literally love the movie this is the best avengers ya even more better than endgame.",
        "With Thanos come into play you think that the avengers would be able to tackle this problem but no. After re-watching Infinity War multiple times it still gets me because it's sad the ending really is just another cinematic masterpiece which Marvel always pull off and the fight scenes are amazing. Marvel have some of the best actors and the best casts I'm not applaud them for that. No mad Steve was just sexy after mate and I loved it a lot.",
        "Beautiful and exciting chapter with all the superheroes that Marvel had introduced us, moving and very messed up manages to entertain masterfully even if it does not bring anything really deep or well developed.",
        "With the participation of almost every member of the MCU, this movie redefines the Action genre, setting the bar higher up than ever before.\n\nSpecial effects are out of this world (2020) the whole cast and crew delivers an excellent job, it takes you to every specter of human emotion the cinematics are great & soundtrack is compelling.\n\nThe story is very engaging, the script is hilarious and the movie doesn't follow the regular Hollywood formula it is with out a doubts not only one of the greatest super hero movies but one of the best achieved films in history hands down. 10/10.",
        "All of these themes built up over the past decade come clashing into one great film where you get to see all your favourite characters meet up, it's almost like a fever dream with all the great acting and perfect screen time for every character with such a great protagonist it's the peak for marvel movies. Just amazing.",
        "The first Marvel film I really liked. Surprisingly in the film there are many spectacular scenes, which are well held and the main transition between them is made seamless, which does not make you miss. And the main thing that surprises the film - the ending, it really makes it clear that Marvel now plays big, since began to break up with the main heroes of the giving films.",
        "This was just as you expected. High action with some light hearted comedy thrown in. The plot had me guessing a couple times. You just had to roll with it. The avengers all seemed weak in this film but that was expected with who they were up against. One heckuva cliffhanger at the end.",
        "I've watched this movie countless times and it is just flawless and is truly the Empire Strikes Back of the MCU.\n\nFrom start to finish Infinity war provides top of the line action, funny moments and great dialogue. It puts together so many characters and balances it all out beautifully. The movie also provides beautiful cinematography.\n\nI will recommend this movie to anyone til the day I die. Thank you Marvel for making such an awesome movie.",
        "It is very hard to please everyone with a film that wraps up a whole universe. Well done.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is an all-around spectacular film. The cast does a wonderful job bringing each character to life, hero or villain. The visual effects are the best Marvel has to offer. Comedic-wise, the movie is smart with its few yet purposefully easing jokes. All the dialogue has great meaning for the story, which progresses perfectly. The editing is well-executed with such a large net of cast to field appropriately. Most perfectly written is the emotional depths that consume the plot, giving Infinity War the punch that truly delivers what the audience desires from a film of such magnitude. Overall, the flaws are few and mostly negligible, making this a nearly perfect film.",
        "This movie is truly once in a lifetime experience.",
        "This movie was so good, non stop action, funny with good plot and characters. No Marvel movie will ever beat this.",
        "Reviewing late but it was awesome. Loved it and i love alk the avengers movies.",
        "This is the strongest among the franchise! I love how the story goes. Movie finished super quick as I didn't even notice. That shows how well it's made.",
        "Plot: 8/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Pacing: 10/10 Acting: 8/10 Music:9/10.",
        "Greta thunberg forbsure wishes, that would be true....",
        "This was an amazing film to experience, whether its on the small screen or the big screen. I enjoyed the story as well as everything that came with it, such an intense story but as always marvel can throw in some jokes as they should it makes it so much more fun to experience, feels like a comic book come to life!\n\nThis is the movie you need to see before endgame, I was so hyped for this movie and it paid off in the best way possible.\n\nMake sure you watch this movie, i saw it a while ago but it deserves a review.",
        "Even after endgame i still think this movie is superior.",
        "From start to finish, this movie is fascinating. I can remember being in shock for a couple of hours after leaving a completely silent theather when the movie was over, I guess I wasn't the only one that was shocked. This is the best MCU film by far, the villian is polished and you can understand his motives (even though its crazy). He's very scary and intimidating but weirdly emotional at the same time. I would actually rate this movie a 9.5, I just think the humor is a tad too much and should've been toned down a bit. I've seen this movie many times and it only gets better with every viewing, incredible job marvel.",
        "To be honest it didn't live up to my expectation but i still enjoy it. I think the story was good, it was pretty simple but wasn't boring but i feel unsatisfied in someway.",
        "I adore this movie, and it is by far my favorite MCU movie. Each character gets at least one great moment or memorable line, they perfectly mesh all of the different tones established in the respective universes, and Thanos is an iconic villain that was truly given the respect he deserved. This movie has quite a bit of humor, but pretty much all of it worked very well to me. Normally when a marvel movie gets this long, it starts to get boring or it heavily drags during some points, but this movie is constantly moving towards the climax and really keeps you invested. I was so surprised by this, as I saw it with all of my high school buddies without many expectations of it. While Endgame will be remembered as the iconic end of the franchise, this will always be my favorite because of the attention given to each of its characters, and the excellent ending that subverts expectations and perfectly sets up our characters for the finale they needed.",
        "Better than the 8.4 it currently has on IMDb. To this day my favourite comic book film, ahead of even the dark Knight. Everything about this from the action to the pacing to the acting. Not to mention the ending which left me speechless.",
        "I can't think of a single flaw in this movie. It and its sequel are an amazing finish to a decade of amazing filmmaking.",
        "This should've been the last movie in the series. The end was perfect.",
        "10 Years of Build Up wasn't wasted on this Movie. Infinity War is one of the greatest movies of all time because of how carefully they set everything else up. Stellar character growth and an incredible story make this stand out amongst the rest of Marvel. Thanos is one of the Greatest Movie Villains of all time due to the handling of his character. Everything from the beginning filled with dread of what's To come to the ending where they fulfilled their promise of dread was done perfectly. Infinity War is one of the best action movies ever made.",
        "It's been nearly one year since I watched this movie. And I still haven't touched the End Game. Because no mater what Hollywood-ish happy ending the End Game has to offer, I don't want it. I want it to stay the way it ended in the Infinity War. Some of you may think this is weird, for someone to want a movie franchise like MCU to end this way. But I don't want to ruin the amazing cinema experience this movie offered to me. I don't think any Marvel movie ever made have offered this much entertainment, action and emotion at the same time.\n\nWorth the time.",
        "Late to the party on the Marvel universe. Finally watching them in order, only End Game to go. Really like infinity war and sets up the big one. Love the mix of adventure, humour and action.\n\nI know my review is totally redundant but was a good movie and has me hooked on anthologies- Star Wars on my horizon next, thanks covid!",
        "BeSt movie EverY scnD is made of fUll entertainment",
        "Absolutely brilliant from the MCU once you put everything together. It was initially painful having to wait a year after the end of infinity war but the film was brilliant. All the characters and different elements to the film. I could go on and on but 10/10 says enough.",
        "While this is a movie that revolves around the villain and leaves audiences stunned in an uneasy way, it was executed flawlessly. I loved all of the characters together and their moments, especially how Thor, Doctor Strange, and even Quill were portrayed in the movie given their character roles. This is like the Empire Strikes Back of superhero movies in my opinion (alongside the Dark Knight). You'll see what I mean if you end up watching!",
        "This movie surpassed the hype. And literally Smashed it.",
        "My first ever Hollywood movie in a cinema and that too a 3d movie...without watching its trailer i just went there....knowing the fact that marvel always gives its ending at the end of movie...but then this movie finished....i remember crying two times and at end i wasn't ready to get up.....i was struck right there....my mind was frozen....and then i came home and i don't remember how many times i have rewatched this masterpiece....for me this was the movie which deserved 100 out of 10.....and i was so happy that i saw it at the screeen....",
        "Gripping plot, well-crafted characters, beautiful visuals. My personal favorite Marvel film with far less cliche's than others.",
        "A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is surely one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. It manages to put together all our favourite superheros in one movie with epic battles and an effective and unexpected ending. It gives literal chills all over the movie. Rating: 9",
        "This movie is perfect. Marvel pulled this off amazingly with us being re-introduced to the characters after civil war was amazing. The writers worked on every little detail on the script and the Russo brothers put it in front of our eyes in such a perfect way. This is why Marvel are the best superhero franchise.",
        "This movie is undoubtedly one of the best superhero movies of all-time. Everything about it is just unprecedented...before this movie, I didn't think a team up like this was even possible. And I am so surprised that an Avengers movie with the villain as the main character can be so entertaining. This is also the funniest Avengers movie, in my opinion, mostly due to the Guardians of the Galaxy meeting with Iron Man and friends. Overall, this was a great movie and one of the greatest movies of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n9.4/10.",
        "They have been planning this since 2012 and after nearly 20 movies they pulled off one of the most detailed and complex plotine in the MCU. It's one of the best MCU movies if not the best. How they manage to pull off all these charaters and the climax in this movie is absolutely astounding!\n\nVery good story with amazing writing and great directing. It's quiet funny though not overdone and surprisingly emotional too. It's quiet unpredictable espeically during the fights. They did an excellent job sharing the screen for more than a dozen intricate characters which sounds impossible into a single movie. Thanos was a complex villain who's personality and motives were well written. The supprting characters were brilliant also. And visually stunning with likable music.\n\nOne of the best supheroes films of all time and quiet enjoyable!\n\nMemorable: Sort of Rewatchable: Yes.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE AND ALL TIME BEST MOVIE.... ACTION.... ACTION.....ACTION.",
        "This is the best film of the marvel cinematic universe. It has all things that a nice film shood have. The actors are fantastic, the cgi really cool and the storyline really interesting.\n\nI suggest to watch this movie only after see the previous movies of mcu to appreciate to the fullest the story.",
        "DREAD IT. RUN FROM IT. DESTINY STILL ARRIVES ALL THE SAME.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War is a mind-boggling superhero film with exceptional cast and psychedelic CGI effects that alter our brain cells. The Russo Brothers are one of a kind imaginative storytellers that pour emotional depth in each character with adequate poignant strength.\n\n#ThanosDidNothingWrong.",
        "I'm a huge comic movie junkie and I could not wait to see this movie. I always see them on opening day in the theaters no matter what! This one is so action packed with all your favorite avengers. I had every emotion and feeling under the sun while watching this. I got goosebumps, I cried, I laughed, I got excited, I had anxiety, I was nervous, I was angry, I was happy. This movie will definitely give you whiplash in the emotion department. But it is by far the best avenger movie to date! And considering that it's their last one, I'm happy about that. But I'm extremely sad that this is the end of this MCU universe and I will miss all of them so very very much. At least we still have Thor, who should be appearing in the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie.",
        "Infinity war Is the best movie . I like this movie more than avengers endgame.",
        "Great movie. You can't go wrong with a Marvel movie. My favourite is definitely Tony Stark/Ironman, super hero and rich too.",
        "Best Marvel movie hands down!! Amazing from start to finish, and how they brought all the characters to light was spectacular. Only wish it was longer. Great flick!!!\n\nI like this movie and it's a complete entertainment package... Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians... This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios...",
        "This is the best marvel movie of all time ....this is better than endgame....very fast.....most action.....all time best villain ......best fights of all time.",
        "Watched all the movies again since on lockdown. Read some of the other reveiws why would you see this movie with out watching the previous ones.",
        "To me what stands out most whenever viewing a superhero film is the hero fighting to protect us from a serious threat at hand. Infinity War I consider a easy entry on a top CBM masterpiece storytelling list. The Russo brothers and cast delivered big time on this one, from the very beginning to the credits I get sucked into this journey and find it one of the best films to revisit of the MCU.",
        "I doubt you'd ever see a film more planned, well thought and better delivered.\n\nNot enough credit has gone to what these guys did with this..... The thoughts, the planning, even things you'd never notice all have deep seated connections.\n\nOverall, the best superhero movie ever released.",
        "Amazing movie with every scene a top notch experience. Story is good, cast is good, direction is good.........i dnt think anything is less than that. The entry of Captain America is one of the best entry scene in cinematic history, second to the entry of Thor in the next part, End Game. The franchise is one of the best and in Big screen, it is an amazing experience. Stream it for sure...!!",
        "Theres nothing that i can say about this film that hasnt already been said,a visual spectacle,yeah thats been said before,an amazing action,already been said but i would certainly recomend this film.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is the one of the 2 best MCU movies besides Endgame. It has beautiful visual effects, outstanding performances, amazing story, fabulous soundtrack, very unexpecting, high stakes, great action sequences, and marvelous chemistry!!! It never slows down, and doubles the hype and stakes as it gets to the end. Thanos is the best MCU villain in the series! Loved the movie so much to Infinity. I've been waiting years for it, and it does not disappoint. Infinity War is a MASTERPIECE.",
        "I'm not sure if it's better than Endgame but this film is amazing. Drax and Mantis are hilarious and I love seeing the development of Wanda and Visions relationship in this film. Tony and Peter are the best duo without a doubt and Wakanda's entrance to this movie was flawless. You can really hear the pain in Thor and feel his loss. Rocket and Groot are also great in this movie. Peter's love for Gamora is also really shown in this movie making it one of the more romantic films of the MCU. This film sets up Endgame perfectly and it is great the whole way through.",

        "I took the family out and We all actually enjoyed Ourselves, and that it the best type of movie experience. I would recommend this film.",
        "The best MCU film ever made! I can watch this movie over and over!",
        "I liked this one better than Endgame, after watching new MCU movies I don't think there will be a better one than this.",
        "Since 2012 I watched every MCU film in the cinema. It was part of my childhood and I was hyped on every single film when it was announced. So when Infinity War was announced it was something special. The final battle with our heroes against the ultimate villain. And it didn't dissapoint. I absolute loved it and the end shocked me. I went out of the cinema and couldn't believe it. For me it's the peak of the superhero genre alongside with Endgame.\n\nSo now were in the Endgame...",
        "You can only really feel the impact of this movie if you've watched the whole MCU in order (its way better, things make way more sense). Most of the Marvel movies are pretty standard and safe. When I first watched this, it was a complete reversal of what I expected.",
        "These movies from MARVELS have their great impact in the whole world. No one knew that a journey of movies which was started in 2008 was so much loved by the audience. The connection through all the movies throughout these years are just awesome . One cannot understand what is going on if he/she missed any movies between these years.",
        "The monster and the monster fights were impressive - i wish the story had some more depth, but we all know what we came here for!\n\nDefinitely recommended.",
        "In my opinion Infinity War was much better than End Game.",
        "They actually did a really good job of working with so many different characters. Kept me interested. Enjoyable to watch. Humor where there was time. Nice to see failure and loss and the pain in Tony Stark's eyes. I don't really like what they did with the hulk. So much better than age of Ultron and end game. Enjoys screen time with iron Man and Spider-Man.",
        "Being called \"Infinity War: Part 1\" at the announcement, Infinity War turned out to be the darker part of an epic final Avengers duology. The emphasis is different to previous films, making Thanos the main character of this darker movie. The cast is excellent as always and really nails the drastically changing emotions in this film. Overall, people can say that this movie is better than Endgame. For my part, I think the double-header of Infinity War and Endgame makes it fantastic, surprising and inspiring story.",
        "I am very happy to have watched this movie in the cinema. It was very different. I'm not a comic reader, so I wasn't expecting such an ending. A great ending.",
        "This film is far better than the previous two Avengers films. It balances all its characters and settings with a deft hand. This time, the central thread is the villain Thanos who is portrayed by Josh Brolin. He is a brooding figure with a false sense of wisdom and he is the true star of this film. Everything else is amazing - the story, the action, the effects, the stakes. Before this, I was not very familiar with the Marvel Cinematic Universe so I didn't recognise half the characters and scenarios, but this film just pulls you along for the ride so you don't necessarily have to know everything beforehand.",
        "Marvel did a good job bringing all these characters to the screen which worked perfectly. The action was fantastic. Thanos as the villain was so good. There wasn't a second that I didn't like about this movie.",
        "Better than endgame in my opinion, includes some of the best battles in mcu, thanos is great in this one",
        "Jaw dropping scenes, Epic fight, got to know the real potential of THOR \u26a1, Best among any MCU and DCEU movies. \ud83d\udc4d You surely get into confusions about the best entry scenes.",
        "This movie is exactly what you wanted in a popcorn summer flick. The action was fantastic from start to finish, the story was good, and they did a pretty solid job getting all the characters involved. The Avengers losing was an awesome touch and the cliff hanger had me excited on End Game (huge disappointment.)",
        "Mind blown, well done Marvel. Captivating, mesmerizing and brilliant",
        "I love this movie, i love it. It must gross a maximum of 2.5 billion dollars at the box office worldwide.",
        "The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie.",

        "Two other titles came to mind as I watched this. \"The sum is much less than the parts\", and/or \"Way too much on the plate\". As I've said in an earlier review on the Avengers, you get into this superhero escalation where the next movie has to be even more threatening and the evil even more evil than in the last one. Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get. One good thing - Doc Strange is actually using spells now, not just body throws. There's a number of good moments in this movie but it's just way too much and at its essence way too stupid.",
        "Everything completely balanced. I want those days back when it released. Totally satisfied with this one.",

        "This film is so good that it cannot be put into words. It was funny, it was exciting etc.\n\nIf you haven't seen this movie, you've missed something, but be sure to check out the MCU's other films first.",
        "An 84 is really low for a movie of this caliber...\n\ni like to this is the culmination of everything and i really think that if they would make a cut of infinity war and endgame together to sell, endgame would also be a 10/10 but they haven't done that part yet\n\nthis movie really delivers on what we've been building up to since the first iron man\n\ni just thought we would never get this far.",
        "I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot. Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.",
        "Best Marvel movie hands down!! Amazing from start to finish, and how they brought all the characters to light was spectacular. Only wish it was longer. Great flick!!!",

        "Who doesn't love an EPIC villain?! With huge production values this was an awesome display of VFX and an epic saga of galactic proportions. The only thing plotwise is that it's totally implausible that a being with Thanos' capabilities would suffer any attack from our protags. In \"reality\" they would've been banished to oblivion long before he acquired his final gems, though I suppose he needed a few of the superheroes in his quest for the gems. I'm stoked to see how \"Endgame\" ties it all up, though I fully expect Thanos to prevail, I'll be supremely PO'ed if the producers sell us the standard Earth-heroes-must-win Hollywood ending.",
        "This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",
        "Omg! One of the best theatre experiences I've ever had! Especially the ending...\n\nI thought this film really balanced out all of these characters well and Thanos is definitely the best MCU villans by far, and one of the best superhero villans by far.",
        "I have always felt Marvel VILLAINS that hit the big screen were laughable. And then came Thanos - finally a formidable opponent that was to be taken seriously.\n\nEnjoyed this one from start to finish.\n\nOnly giving it a 9 because its sequel is better and perfect and thus deserves a perfect score of 10.\n\n9/10",

        "Greetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"Avengers: Infinity War\" (2018) was a pretty fun and good movie overall. The ending kinda saved it for me to be a 7/10, ending was good and that is why i'm giving this movie 8/10. But i do not believe that it will end eventually the way it ended in this movie, common - there a more bucks needs to made from this universe. That said, i do not understand what is this movie making on the IMDB 250 list (currently at 30th position) - its definitely not that great. You can trow a rock at me if this movie is better then \"Terminator 2\" or \"Apocalypse Now\" - this only shows how many fans this movie and franchise has - not the quality of this product itself.\n\nOverall, \"Infinity War\" was a good 2 h 20 min escapism, but it suffers pacing issues here and there. At the end i liked this picture and will check the 2nd part as well.",
        "It feels like years in the making to get to the final 2 films. The question being, has it been worth it?\n\nI think you would have to say yes. Its an impressive effort from Marvel to bring everything together in these final 2 movies.\n\nIt ticks all the boxes that would be expected visually and aurally so we don't need to really discuss these elements.\n\nThe story is key here and the ending is awesome :)",
        "Infinity War had a lot to offer with stunning cgi that basically made the entire film apart from the heroes heads animated but done so well it looks real. The adventure the quest the ultimate event, and over ten years of waiting for the MCU to finish. Thanos really makes you question your morals... if you're twelve years old and don't understand the myth of overpopulation and genocidal tactics. The action and heros are a welcome inclusion and yeah this movie was kicka**. Not as good as Endgame but close.",
        "This movie is currently the pinnacle of marvel movies. I've heard people criticize this movie for incredibly stupid reasons like being \"to long\" or using cgi. Those people are called weirdos. Watch the movie. It's good.",
        "Okay, plenty of action, lots of humor, excitement galore...so why the 1 rating from me? Because, and I'm not telling you one word about how it ends, this has to be the WORST way to end a movie I've ever seen...and wished I hadn't. The heck with it. Guess who won't be lined up to see how the next one goes? That would be ME 'cause frankly, at this point, I don't care.",
        "This is the best MCU movie I've ever watch. A great story, a lot of intense action with a powerful villain, a great CGI, I loved it. This movie was better than any other MCU movies, even Avengers Endgame. I really hope that the Russo brothers will return to direct other MCU Movies again.",

        "The rating of 10 are obviously people under the age of 18 or extreme fans of Marvel. This is not even the best Marvel movie this year(Black Panther had better story & drama), definitely nowhere near 'best superhero movie ever'. The action and special effects are very well done, the pacing, powers and 'decisions' are on par with a B-horror movie. When having the ability to end a scene quickly or leave a scene quickly, our 'heroes' would stand there and trade one-liners. I seriously considered walking out at the lack of competence. For the record, I loved Avengers, loved Winter Soldier so it is not like I cannot enjoy a superhero flick. This one is not(unless you are a fanboy(girl).",
        "There isn't anything better than this movie right here it's legendary.",
        "Not to say that it's perfect, but I felt that it was able to handle all the characters interactions and the overall story much better than the next film.",
        "By far the best marvel film, it is so good. The most emotional marvel film to date. The battle is the best part and the parts after the battle are very emotional and after 1st time watching you really want to know what's going to happen and gets you thinking a lot. The acting is solid, visual effects are great, definitely a 10/10 especially for a marvel film.",
        "Why is this movie soooooo good?? Because of the Black Order (the villains) & the unexpected ending!!!! The good guys ALWAYS win in Comic Book Movies, but Infinity Wars is 2nd to NONE!!",
        "This film was complete and utter tosh. Judging by the way it has been positively reviewed by some other IMDB members, I cannot help but wonder if we watched the same movie. I fell asleep repeatedly during the opening night screening in my city and I lost most interest in it after 90 minutes or so. (The run time was much too long.) While I've enjoyed quite a few of these Marvel big-screen productions in recent years, I didn't enjoy this one very much at all. Unless you're a comic book fan, I'd take a pass on this one.",
        "Avengers infinity war is exciting and hilarious. avengers infinity war is directed by the Russo brothers who also made captain america the winter soldier and civil war. The characters are combined in new and interesting ways and that is especially the case with Thor Rocket and Groot,The three of them were hilarious. There is also tension because you want to know what happens and who will survive the story. the film is well filmed and the action is well captured. the special effects are impressive and the music by Alan Silvestri is very good. the movie is well acted and especially thanos played by Josh Brolin is well played. Avengers infinity war is one of the best marvel movies and I definitely recommend it.",
        "Now this was epic... surprising plot twists.... so much build up - epic fight scenes, good humour and great banter. The ultimate penultimate and better the 2nd time around",
        "The reason i love this movie well there are millions of reasons but one of the reasons is that THE BAD GUY WINS like i love that its dark kinda its realistic in a way as to say that not all the time the good guys win. I just love movies that shows the bad guys win like this and revenge of the sith i need to see more movies or shows like it coz not all the time the good guys are gonna win i love it i inject that s**t",
        "Avengers infinity war is a masterpiece in every way with an amazing story that is never boring, phenomenal action that's intense but also a lot of fun, amazing acting (stand outs are Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, and josh brolin), fantastic visuals, lovable and interesting characters, a great villain with thanos, hilarious comedy, gut wrenching moments, and a shocking ending. Watch it immediately.",
        "Recommend watching this after watching other MCU movies chronologically!",
        "A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.",
        "Best MCU movie? I really like the way they used Thanos in this movie and in Endgame. He is one of the most bada$$ villain imo.",

        "I wanted so much to like this film but for me it came out as too knowing, self referential and repetitively dull. Mark Ruffalo seems to have changed his character for the worst, Chris Prat/The Guardians of the Galaxy are beyond annoying and several others are badly under used. Also for me Thanos was too human.",

The entire plot took 10 years to develop and is summed up in this latest entry in 4 or 5 sentences. Acting isn't necessary or required, just grimace and look sweaty and vacant. Meanwhile we'll fill the screen with 50,000 CGI lights and explosions and convince you what is happening matters. Well it doesn't.",

        "As epic and satisfying as Endgame was, I think the true peak of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is Infinity War. The brilliant weaving-together of characters from such different corners of the universe into their unique storylines, the incredible examination of Thanos as an actual character in the story, top-tier visuals and action, and a final sequence that is absolutely gut-wrenching and powerful: this film will always stand above the rest for me. The Empire Strikes Back of Marvel films. 10/10.",

Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just \"world domination.\" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies.

        "Best comic book movie ever and the best way to end marvel cinematic world",
        "Suffering hype fatigue, over a year of industry talk about this movie in pre release. It takes away from viewing the movie. In the end it's just more of the same computer generated over the top smash and bash that appeals to 12 year olds or those that are stuck at that age. The first avengers was original. But now what Hollywood movie makers due best, take an original movie concept to cash in until death in franchising occurs. Sorry about raining on your Hollywood comic book Heroes block borer. But the only hero I can see is someone to say enough comic book sequels. They've become boring and predictable recycles. I spent more time thinking about how uncomfortable the theater seat was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie. Seems Hollywood is addicted to CGI for making movies that shouldn't be made. If they keep going this way they could probably try selling a film of things just blowing up, no story, plot or actors acting just things blowing up.",
        "My Rating : 8/10\n\n'Avengers: Infinity War' is a superb entertainer and pushes the MCU forward to it's epic conclusion in 'Endgame'.\n\nLeave your critical thinking at home and enjoy some fine action-adventure.",

The cinematography in this movie is beautiful making it visually stunning. The characters are also very interesting and you care about most of them. I recommend this Avengers film.",
        "I will only say that this movie is twice as long as it should be and has way too many characters. I won't even try to guess why they did that. I love Marvel and have a huge tolerance for bad movies, but by 29 minutes in I was ready to give up. If all the bad stuff had been cut out this would have been a great 90 minute movie.",

        "For some reason, the Oscar voters will never vote for a CGI actor because \"it's computer generated'\". That's BS. The character is brought to life by a real actor, and if the acting is flat, so is the character, regardless of how good the CGI is. Josh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost. Chris Hemsworth and ZoeSaldena also both pulled out magnificent performances, but this was Thanos's movie. Oscars, make a new category for CGI actors!",

I'll never spend a cent for Marvel ever again. After 20 years of iron age ennui, just when I fought they were finally bringing some silver age fun with Ant Man and Spiderman, they release their worst soulless product ever, and close it with a big middle finger to our faces.\n\nJust let this company die out, you'll do the world a service.",
        "This movie is a piece of crap, just like every other marvel movie of 2017-2018. The storyline is bad, the acting sucks, the jokes are stupid. Thanos is the worst villian ever; his acting and personality in the film is pathetic. This movie is a waste, not a classic.",
        "I wasn't expecting much going in. I figured it would be all action, since there are so many characters. But I at least thought some of the action would be entertaining. But it wasn't. Not one action scene was any good. Thor Ragnarok was a masterpiece compared to this. This movie was truly dreadful. My girlfriend, who normally likes any superhero movie that's action-packed, even though this movie stunk. Many boring scenes of talking....all about nonsense. Because when every single character can do absolutely anything....when every character has powers that are limitless....like for instance, let's go to outer-space, let's teleport, let's shoot a rope that curves 20 times and wraps around our opponent....when anyone can do anything....the result is total boredom after a short while. The 9.0/10 rating here is Fake News, I guarantee you that. Statistically impossible....especially for such a bad movie. I was sooo bored.",

        "Marvel seems to be on a roll towards killing off this franchise. The previous entry...Black Panther...was, generously, just OK but Av:IW was just awful. This entry was abt an hour too long and way too slow to develop. I had trouble staying awake at times. The final battle scene was OK but the entire movie was dark. I don't mean the theme, I mean the pucture itself was dark. So dark that in some interior scenes it was difficult to see what was going on. Save your time and money.",

The Marvel franchise went downhill since Iron Man 3 which hurts so bad considering he is my number 1. But this movie took the cake. There were so many inconsistencies, so many random characters which weren't introduced in the MCU (only in the comics). There were far too many big egos and sub plots to try and cram into one movie. And to the masses, it was good. So hats off to them for making a crowd pleasing movie. But to the others who like some sense and substance when they pay good money to see a movie, try harder.",
        "The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy combine forces to battle Thanos (Josh Brolin). It seems he has a glove that needs five stones to give him power to control the galaxy. He has three on the and will do ANYTHING to get the last two.\n\nIt's too long and has no ending but I still loved it! The CGI Is flawless, the action scenes are fast and furious and the story whizzes along. The movie does assume you've seen every Marvel comic book film to get the characters so be warned. The acting is great and the movie manages to juggle multiple characters and plots and still make sense. Can't wait for part 2! :)",
        "This film is better than the hype.This is one of the best movie of Marvel ever.",
        "All the aspects of existence will remember this film as one of the best. Great character build, the story stays consistent and knows exactly what it wants to do and who to draw in. The action is chair gripping and very tense. It's rare that we see a villain act out of what they believe will be for the good of the universe. This is a movie that we knew was coming and one that no one was ready for.",
        "After each marvel movie, you wonder what new could they possibly introduce now, and the mcu never fails to leave you awestruck at the end of the film, or at the beginning, or in the middle or at any point in the movie. They don't always show the heroes win, that's what give their villains respect and importance, so the mcu is not only about the avengers, it is equally about Thanos. No matter how tense the situation is, there is no shortage of witty and sarcastic comments.",

The premise of the movie was laughable and I'm a bit surprised that it's the best Disney/Marvel could come up with. It was like something DC/WB would come up with.",
        "This is one of the absolute best movies of 2018 and how it didn't win any Academy Awards is astonishing to me. I think this is Robert Downey Jr's best performance, and Thanos is definitely the best MCU villain to date. Also, the twist at the end was just perfect to set up Endgame, and the Guardians joining the Avengers was amazing. This movie was a perfect Avengers movie. And the action and storytelling is the best of any MCU flick.",

        "There are six Infinity Stones, the film explains, Some are spread across the universe, but half of them are on Earth, where they've play The film can't spread around its camera time in equal measure, but it does give all the characters an equal shot at despair. A decade of films have led up to Thanos, and Avengers: Infinity War delivers on that threat with a film that upends the entire fabric of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. No character is safe from the far-reaching implications of his actions, and it's impressive to see just how dark Marvel is willing to go for this story. Even the biggest fan favorites are truly vulnerable, and the movie reinforces that idea - relentlessly, at times - as it sprints toward its final stunning moments. By the time the credits roll, audiences will no doubt be aghast at just how far the Avengers have fallen.ed significant roles in past MCU movies. Thanos is trying to collect all of them,This is a comic book universe, after all, and the fact that Infinity War is able to embrace this darkness in the first place is a wonder. The only real crime is that audiences will have to wait until 2019 to see the conclusion",
        "Maybe I'm just sick of superhero movies. But I found myself bored and so sick of the mindless violence in this film that really just lacks a good strong story at its core. Superhero movies have overstayed their welcome for me. This is the last one I'll go to see I'm done.",
        "A supremely entertaining movie. I was honestly not very fussed with the MCU movies watching them come out over the past decade. However I've recently rewatched everything together in chronological order and I can now truly appreciate what a feat this is. Wow. Bringing everything together the way they did, the fan service, epic scenes and one hellava villain. Well played Feige, well played.",
        "Yep, you heard me....Just don't. If you love these characters, were hooked on the previous movies, *don't.* If you deal with anxiety, panic, depression, or anything else, *don't.* This movie is not like the others, and honestly, does not show much screen time for most the characters. It is much more violent and emotional than the previous films, but more than that, it is extremely disturbing. Basically, if you feel obligated to view it for your favorite characters, just beware, there's not much screen time for them, so don't push yourself, or feel like you have to do it. Also, I would definitely NOT take kids to see this, as the movie has a very dark and disturbing atmosphere to it.",
        "A legendary film that needs to be watched by all. Amazing story, graphics, and performances by all.",
        "This should NOT have worked as well as it did. So many characters into only 2 and a half hours... and it knocks it out of the park. The acting, the story and the effects were amazing. Thanos is the best villain.\n\nI will never forget the reaction i had to the ending in the theatre. I didn't expect them to go that route.\n\nI personally think this movie is better than endgame. It holds up to rewatches better than its sequel.\n\nOverall, a landmark achievement in the film world.",
        "I really enjoyed Thor turning up. Loved the bit with the spiders with the fighting. It looked like a real war. Titan was really cool.",
        "I really liked the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Likewise Iron Man & The Avengers. But these never-ending franchise add-ons are pretty boring unless you're 12 or a CGI junkie. There's very little evidence of a story behind all of the mind-boggling action, over acted drama, and special effects. It drives me nuts anymore, when fighting takes a 5 minute 'time out' for a lame, \"poignant\" dialog scene. I guess that I've seen too many of these to enjoy them anymore.",
        "Absolutely stunning movie with a great plot and a thrilling ending!",
        "Mostly the fanboys giving it 10/10 but this is just another superheroes movie.\n\nEnding is definitely unexpected which left the theatre audience speechless.",
        "Scene after scene just explosions and hollow dialogues that were meant to be funny but they\u00b4re not. This montage of CGI with idiotic dialogues serves only for bucks, it\u00b4s not made for cinephiles not even for comic collectors like me. Avengers: Infinity War is dull, not funny, extremely artificial and definetely extremely boring, btw I love Marvel universe since I was a child but this is not Marvel, its garbage",
        "Honestly though, at this point people can't leave marvel alone because their to good at making movies. Movies like these should show people super hero movies aren't always stupid idiot baby shows. People who say superhero movies don't count as movies believe that only realistic to real life types of movies are considered \"art\", and even if that's true why do people like matrix, lord of the ring, incredibles, alien, back to the future, the dark knight, Jurassic park, etc? Easy, because those movies are good and a lot of people like them, those and both marvel are completely unrealistic fictional things that could never happen in real life but no one cares, there still good and could be just as entertaining. Nothing wrong with movies like these (excluding all the rare weird cult type fan bases outside of the movie or stuff like that).",
        "Jurassic Park, The Sixth Sense, Alien, Harry Potter and The Hangover are great movies. Putting all characters, realities and styles of these movies into one would probably result in a hidious thing, and that's what's wrong with this Avenger movie. There's too much of everything. More heroes, villains, battles, worlds, stars and CGI do not make a better movie. I really liked the first two avengers movies wich also did have a lot of heroes, but it had it's own style. This was a mix of everything that didn't really match. Thank god part 2 of this movie wich had a lot more of what Hollywood movies often tend to forget : a story, emotions, a twist, a plot,... That could explain the very high rating here, allthough a clickfarm also could. If I get the chance to see the sequal for free I would, but if I miss it, that's just fine.",
        "Have been waiting a very long time for a superhero mashup like this film to come out. Great preformances from the actors, and an overall fantastic story. Josh Brolin really does shine as Thanos.",
        "I'm tired of the comic based movie genre which further signals the death of original scripts and content. Don't get me wrong, originality alone does not make a good story. This movie continues to try squeeze water from a rock and I leave wanting so much more. The movie was much too long and especially the fight scenes. As in the old Wendy's commercial, \"Where is the beef?\", or in my case a good story and characters I care about.",
        "It is the best comic book movie ever made in history.better than every single movie",
        "In all my years as a Marvel Comic fan this is the worst outing as far as I am concerned. Yes it did follow through on many out lying factors but I was gob-smacked as to the ending. While I will not give away the ending I will say I was greatly displeased. It would make me think hard about spending my money on their next Marvel outing",
        "I'm probably the only fan of Super Hero Squad: Infinity Gauntlet but if you found this Avengers: Infinity War too heavy you should give it a try. Infinity War is filled with more super whiners than super heroes; unless you like your superheroes to whimper, demand to be sacrificed, argue, and to die. Not my idea of good times. Not lining up to see the sequel/conclusion. I'd rather read the comics, or watch it on cartoons. Also, it's stupid that the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer aren't in this universe.\n\nTry to say something positive: ok, the villains were different and refreshing. And it was cool to see so many Avengers represented. Had some cool scenes. Gave it a generous 6/10 but will never watch again.\n\nHero up! and watch Super Hero Squad or for something less childish, Avengers Assemble Season 2, which also tells the story of Thanos.",
        "I think infinity war is one of the best Avengers movie. There is too much action, also I like development of characters. We can say too much about this movie but I am too lazy for this and I'm not eloquent person, so that's all what I can say:)",
        "This movie amounts to a melange of violence against a plot of nothing. If you have an invincible monster exactly what can happen in the end.",
        "Incredible movie. Every scene was amazing. Zero flaws. This is peak of Marvel that told a beautiful story with the villain at the center of it. This was Thanos' story and his victory. The fight scenes were beautifully done and the CGI was impeccable. The Russo Brothers did amazing!!",
        "It's better than endgame. This is very nice movie. I enjoyed it, and sorry for endgame.",
        "This has to be the best Avengers film. I love them all, but the ending of this one leaves you on edge which I LOVE!",
        "Just watch it this movie has everything what u wanted.",
        "Because guess what, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is a straight up porn for any fan of cin\u00e9matography. The plot is as simple, formulaic and stupid as it can get. There is a huge amount of holes, henny. The chemistry between actors (hence acting) is non-existent. All that we get - is a portion of idiotic choices just to excuse the upcoming \"ACTION\". Ye, baby, gimme more... These sweet fireworks and a talking piece of purple CGI is all I need.\n\nThese \"Avengers\" might be mentally disabled: can't think OR use abilities OR communicate with each other. Well, at least they succeeded at jabbing one another with some jokes (a benevolent 1 star for this).",
        "An almost perfect movie!! For a long time, we're waiting for a superhero movie that is not clich\u00e9ic and boring, and we have Deadpool,but Infinitty War is a visual show, and it's worth our time. I can hardly wait for Avengers Endgame next year",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.\n\nBut it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.\n\nThis movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios.",
        "Maybe I'm just getting massive franchise fatigue but I found the moving totally borIng. The story is linear, the stakes don't seem real by foreshadowIng the fact that they can change the past, and there's a LOT of backstory they fill in to get you up to speed on all 500 marvel super hero's from their various franchises that it's hard to feel emotionally engage. The power balance between characters strength and weaknesses seemed flawed. One character would be in peril from X weapon in one scene but then beat a more powerful weapon Y in another scene. Movies attain suspension of disbelief by setting and following rules. These rules seemed sloppily applied but all in all it wasn't as bad as Venom...",
        "This movie literally couldve ended in 40 mins why drag it to put more fight scenes and more jokes? 10 years for this movie plot???? did they hire zack snyder or what\n\ncool scenes but couldve been better thanos is weaker than he is in comics. black order is way worse!\n\nfor character strengths, whos ever stronger than another?! one character looks weak at a time OBVIOUSLY to pave way for \"heroic\" scene or entry of another and later the same character does a move proving to be the strongest in the battle zone. screw this logic.\n\nalso, if infinity stones are from before the universe, blah blah blah, how do they only affect a mile long lmao? so either thanos is weak or the stones (or both) in mcu",
        "One of the best movies ever made! I am speechless. Congrats to all the people involved. They deserve a standing ovation.",
        "This movie literally has the whole potential of marvel cinematics and makes you go through emotional roller coaster, from laughter to crying. Amazing!",
        "They did a wonderful job with the villain. Sound effects were good. A variety of characters. It felt like they were trying to mash a bunch of political views into the story though which felt forced and sort of ruined it because people are trying to enjoy the fantasy movie. Eg: girl power thing, the white and black thing. Very uncomfortable for some viewers. Would of been nice to focus on the story",
        "I just love the marvel movies . i was very excited when the movie started. the movie managed itself vey nicely according to the story and made the viewers very much excited about the next and the final part of AVENGERS.....",
        "It's the best super hero movie by a mile!!! YAASSSSSS.",
        "This is a culmination of over fifteen movies and an improvement on a very high bar which was set. Bringing together an even bigger cast many of which I could never picture together only a few years ago.\n\nFrom the outset this is a roller coaster which blends heart breaking tragedy, breathless action and pure drama oh and not to mention some well blended comedy at key moments.\n\nHard to find a fault with this movie but can not wait to see if they can lift the bar even further in future.",
        "Characters make in this film really seems to be original ,filmed very good ,can hold audience maximum duration in the movie , good job Marvel Team and Congrats for grand success of this movie.",
        "This movie was litterly the same as the avengers and civil war. Nothing new here except that the hype is getting stronger??? By rules of nature hype must die down over time but marvel fanboys want more bad movies? Disney's board of director's and their shareholders are laughing their ass off. They acquire the rights of a universe with some superheroes en then they release 5 superhero movies a year that are complete and utter trash but its fanbase will love it no matter wat. now a cgi war movie (were we all now how of how it will end, it doesn't becouse Disney will keep spitting out these movies until marvel fanboys stop going to these trash movies.) Is considerd better than movies like Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, forrest gump and Leon??? Well if this is the case than i will leave this site and never come back becouse i use this site to see if a movie is worth seeing. But if a crap movie like this is considerd to be as good as THE GODFATHER!!! then i can no longer trust this site and will de-recommend it to everyone that wants to use it for the same purpose as i did.",
        "I don't typically write reviews; however, someone needed to balance out the over the top love for this bad plotted film with way too many stars. For me, it all comes down to this question: \"Can this movie stand alone without having seen at least 75% of the other Marvel movies?\" The answer is NO! I know I've seen most of Marvel's movies (loved Black Panther) but I think to enjoy this film you have to be a serious Marvel fan. Even with as many of the Marvel movies that I've seen, I still didn't have enough back story or character recognition to pull together this plot which seemed to me to just be an excuse to have CGI battles over and over. Then, to make matters worse, it's sooo looong. Add to that, that I need to see a sequel to see how this story ends and I hate it - 1 star out of 10 - done and done.",
        "Second best film right behind Endgame. Brilliantly made and greatly acted.",
        "What just happened? from the first minute it was kicked off with action, and never really stopped. it was fight after fight after fight. it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, and also made me very emotional. very well done",
        "\"Avengers\": Infinity War\" is an epic unlike any other. It's a reminder of how far the MCU has come in 10 years and this movie capitalises on its bloated, but beloved cast to draw you in. Every character gets their own moment to shine a little, the dizzying, vibrant comic book action is satisfying and defies conventions. While admittedly, this darker chapter in the Marvel movie-verse is oddly paced and suffers from the occasional tonal inconsistency, all issues can easily be forgiven as almost each scene is a sizeable dosage of fan service. Josh Brolin as Thanos deserves all the attention he gets, as he is a villain with a tragic story to tell. For really the first time, the consequences are felt and resonate long after the credits roll. non-stop comic book action and surprising emotional depth. While a little uneven at times, its beloved cast, outstanding villain and sheer scope never underwhelm and the end product is something truly epic.",
        "Wonderful graphics, intriguing story, strong acting, but some of the cheesy jokes are making these movies less than laughable...\n\nOf all the comics I read in the 60s and 70s, I don't recall any emphasis on laughs...\n\nI love a joke as much as the next guy, but it's hard to take a comedic line seriously...\n\nStill, a great show and I'll be long anticipating to learn where it goes now...\n\nThough it seems readily apparent!",
        "Relies mostly on shock value. not much substance or plot. undid all of thor's character development in thor: ragnarok (loss of eye, hammer). good acting, though! overall, shocking but not surprising.",
        "Best villain on MCU also the introduction of them was top notch showing how horror and terrifying he was. So many epic / nerve wracking scene, love how many characters in this movie and they still got so much screen time with no too fast impression, very well written screenplay.\n\nWould give 8.5 but there's no half here.",
        "Can you imagine a better comic book movie? So much going on from start to finish, and yet the story is well-written, every character is unique and brings extra flavor to the film, and every transition fits perfectly. The Russo Brothers really outdid themselves, I was utterly captivated the entire movie and will probably rewatch IW multiple times without getting bored. This is a treat for comic book fans everywhere. Also, how about Josh Brolin as Thanos? Ridiculously good!",
        "Infinity War is the pinnacle of the MCU. Out of the dozens of unique characters in the film, they managed to give each decent development. The atmosphere is perfect, displaying both the seriousness and darkness that Thanos brings while still including some good humor. Infinity War takes the action/comedy combo of the rest of the MCU but also manages to escalate the gravity of the situation. The moment Thanos sets foot on the screen, he is intimidating to audiences and heroes alike.\n\nIn the end, this almost seems like a film more about Thanos than about our heroes and is a refreshing approach. Definitely one of the best superhero films ever made.",
        "I wish I could have my 2.5 hours back. The film was over-long and packed with way too much violence for what it delivered as entertainment. It also spent too much time focusing on the villain and his rationalizations for genocide. I found myself wondering if such indulgences would seem inappropriate to dwell on for a real mass murderer like Rudolf Hoess, why is it appropriate dramatically for Thanos? Answer: It's not.\n\nThis film was easily the worst Marvel film I've seen.",
        "I really tried to like this movie. I smiled and expressed enthusiasm. I bounced and nodded. I boned up on the Marvel universe. Finally the day came and I watched the movie. For some reason I was completely bored. One fight after another. Lots of stuff blowing up. Lots of people running around. Characters blowing up and running around at the same time. Is it possible I have become overstimulated by this type of adolescent entertainment? Believe me, my girlfriend and I have a better relationship than some of the so-called romance subjects in this hyped up disaster movie. I think I have grown up and comic book characters are no longer my role models. Oh well.",
        "A film that exhilarates and cheats you at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes. Sure, non-stop action with all your favorite heroes and foes, yet an overly fast paced plot leaves only the outstanding SFX to remember when you feel cheated by the ending, and knowing you have to wait another year to close-out the mystery. So until then, you have to jump to your own conclusions. Not a fan of these type of plots. Still, exciting and well directed and acted. A generous 9/10 from me.",
        "The movie has some entertainment value, but don't believe the hype and think you're going to see an intelligent or coherent plot, something innovative, or even something you haven't seen before.\n\nDisney/Marvel is riding the wave and releasing movie after movie (rightfully so) to get as much profit while the craze lasts. There's not much differentiating this Avengers movie from the other Marvel movies.",
        "As I do with all Marvel stuff, I've loaded it onto the tablet I keep in the bathroom. The scenes are perfectly cut for some minutes in there. And it doesn't matter if you don't remember your last visit after a day or two, there's no correlation. Wether it's shapeless, explosive, dripping, ludicrous or misleading, it always ends with the feeling that there could have been more. But even if you try harder for another minute, there's only void. And as soon as you stand up, the whole stuff is flushed out of our memory. Only persists a reminiscence of nauseating miasma. Mankind seems to enjoy it. Well in that case, I've got a be an alien. I've decided to quit eating any fibre to never have to endure it again.",
        "I mean I don't get it why this movie came in the top 250 movies in IMDb. I am not saying that this is a bad movie but the best super hero movie ever? People have just have just made up their minds that it's avengers so it must be a very good movie. The pervious avengers movie were better than this one. In this movie everything was scattered, the good thing was that they connected everything with the previous marvel movies that is why I gave it a 5 rating or else I wouldn't have given it that also. The end especially, people are left clueless as to what is about to happen. Only that person will know who has actually read the comics. I was shocked to see that this movie is above Fight Club!! I mean what on earth are people thinking? This is just my view on it though but I don't think this was a good movie, there was just a lot of hype created for this movie because which people actually started believing that this is the greatest movie ever made while in reality it was just an average movie.",
        "From the story to trying to incorporate The Black Panther into the story just hurts the franchise all together. The story starts off good, gets better then goes to the dogs with a ending that just does not make sense.",
        "One of my all time greats. In any way perfect, with one of the best Heels in Movie History...thank you",
        "Its cgi fun but also a big chaotic holey mess. Too much bludgeoning.of forced emotions and a lot of idiocy and actions Seriously surprised at the 8-10 syar ratings..",
        "This is a film made for children, not adults. Ninja-Turtles kind of movie. Stupid jokes, no plot, non-sense whatsoever. At least, when I was a child, films used to make if only a bit of sense; not any more for milennials, it seems. New world, new styles, very little brain. Pity...",
        "It was boring and I Sleep when I watch the movie It was Kid Family friendly I don't get any jokes the best thing in this movie is Thanos Poor CGI",
        "First off the movie was great from begining to the end . A roller coaster ride of adventure I enjoyed it every minute and went out the theaters wanting to see more. So expect me to go see it again before it end its run.! No super hero movie has ever come close to what people at Marvel are doing at the moment. And Avengers Infinity War said that furthermore this movie soared through my expectations. The visual was spectacular the action was explosive and satisfying. The Russo's have crafted Something truly remarkable and freshness that you'd never expect. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing narrative possibilities that strech in any direction. On the strength of this outing, that's Something to be anticipated, rather than feared.\n\nI highly recomend everyone to go see it",
        "He is a sentimental proletarian, willing to sacrifice his life's favorite to rectify this chaotic and overcrowded universe. After the renovation, he didn't want to engage in slavery or become an emperor. Instead, he lived in seclusion in the mountains and forests. Watching the sunset, he lamented the uncertainty of life and perhaps had time to raise chickens and other vegetables. Reducing half of the population in a random way also reflects its fairness and innovation, which is a rare example in boss.",
        "What a terrible film. Theme was incomprehensible. Acting though was quit good even if the acting was all CGI. And, the ending???? WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

        "This is an Epic! Instalment in the MCU, The story of unity in the face over overwhelming odds in inspiring.\n\nIf you haven't started the MCU Universe don't start here the story told over the years to get to this point is amazing.\n\nIt is something the human race should aspire to do, put others first and do the right thing.\n\nAvengers Assemble.",
        "This film is one of the final chapters of the Marvel superhero story that started 10 years ago.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War has a story related to a series of previous Marvel films. The eternal rock line that has appeared in a number of films is now a source of trouble",
        "Complete downer movie. I can't believe I paid money and wasted hours of my life watching this trash. If I could go back in time and stop myself from seeing it, I would. I don't watch superhero movies to walk out of the movie MORE SAD than when I walked in!",
        "If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones. So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!",
        "Full of CGI, no dialogue, action packed and zero substance. If you still like these kind of things after a tone of other superhero movies, you will probably enjoy it.",
        "While the specials effects are spectacular, it's the writing, the overarching plot and how everything comes together so organically after so many years that makes this phase exceed the superhero genre. No spoilers, but this movie subverts every Hollywood movie cliche that has ever preceded it and proves you can produce works of art in any genre.",
        "Most of the characters can only leave an impression of the last moment of death.",
        "This movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time. If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of \"everything is gonna be alright\" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don't get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more. I'm definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie.",

        "Thanos is the most powerful, he always defeats all the heroes, (but they always like his action) and we only see (thanos is in wakanda and killing Vision). It will be that the stones are entangled in various scenarios; that they are not well, by the power of thanos (when it was the snap), and that the heroes solve the revenge.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is a spectacle to behold to the general audience. To the avid Marvel Studios fan, however, it is the epitome of movie going. It spends next to no time explaining the close relationships some characters share, and instead, builds the most memorable villain since Heath Ledger's Joker. If you have watched all of the other Marvel movies up to this point, you will be delighted, debilitated, and craving more.",
        "The CGI is great, the acting is good, the action is wonderful, Thanos is really scary, every hero (almost) is here. And yet things make little sense. There are again confusion between forces that have many orders of magnitude between them, there is little strategic or, indeed, tactical logic in this \"war\". I enjoyed the film and I am sure it's going to blow so many people away, but it was so damn pointless.\n\nAnyway, the idea is that the movie is just the first of a two parter so my recommendation is to wait until both movies have been released and watch them back to back. I know it's hard, with all the references flying around you and friends wanting to discuss how Star Lord destroyed the universe (oops!), but I think you will enjoy the ending a lot more knowing you will be watching the rest in a few minutes and not next year.",

        "The writing was so bad. Too many characters, horrible humor and one liners. It was cringeworthy. Just a bunch of mindless fights and battles we've seen a million times before and then the cringeworthy exposition and bad acting slowed down, low tone, over dramatic speeches.\n\nEvil man or group wants to destroy the world and just before they succeed they are stopped by the super hero(s). Seen one you've seen them all. SKIP!!",
        "The hype of this movie has been .. enormous ... and then they cr-p out this from their b-hind. This gives me the EXACT same feeling as the totally mind-ruining sequence in Dallas .. just before the character Bobby is waking up .. and the last most part of the series .. had just been a dream. I'll eat my shorts if the next movie doesn't have any kind of similarity to that Dallas plot-turnaround. If the Russo brothers wanted to sink the franchise to the bottom .. they sure have succeeded. I know I'm a minority in my opinion .... but maybe I'm one of the clear visioned ones, seeing what this movie really has done as far as ruin the future avengers or marvel movies. I feel cheated of any future experiences. This is not a spoiler, I'm just stating facts, together with my own opinions of a sad and boring predictable action-upgrade for every sequence .. that is the Russo brothers amateurish way of directing a movie.",
        "Foreword: I was dragged to watch this film.\n\nDisney are trying to hard. Trying to hard to cram superficial pop culture references into every 5 minutes of \"dialogue\". Trying too hard to take a tongue-in-cheek, meta approach to tired superhero movie cliches, like that makes them any better. Now they're giving us an predictably unpredictable ending to a mediocre procession of cliche, angsty superheroes.\n\nDisney have utterly destroyed modern mainstream cinema.",
        "Superheros are super because they do amazing things compared to the rest of us in this world. Here however, everyone does amazing things, always, for too long. It becomes boring. There is no normal world in the background to provide the contrast, it is one (long) fantasy tale. They're all \"super\" so no one is super anymore. And I feel some character have lost their true nature. Iron Man for example: what defines the character is his suit of armour, high tech sure, but still \"clunky\" and \"solid\". This new nano tech suit fits and looks like a soft glove: transition from a knight in armour to a well dressed, tailored character. Of course the movie is visually striking, but again, from the first scene to the last: I got used to the visuals after about 20 minutes, the rest felt to me like repetition.",
        "Positives:\nDirecting and the script\nMain cast\nThanos\nMusical score\nAction scenes\nScope\n\n\nNegatives:\nNot much",

        "Infinity war was a bit sloppy with its character development and story telling, but reasonably successful at jamming so many characters together and keeping it funny and mostly entertaining without making it feel like a comedy. Despite its length, the movie kept enough humor and action to keep you interested and kept the movie from dragging.",
        "I have seen every crazy movie in this crossover series, and I am now done.\n\nThis was too dark, WAY to slow, and disjointed beyond belief.\n\nEnjoyed Deadpool 2 much better which I saw last week when I couldn't get seats for Infinity Wars. I can't understand how word of mouth would bring people in to see this drivel.\n\nAs always, we sat thru the credits which unfortunately showed more of the same coming.",
        "After 10 years, marvel still makes their fans wait another year by bridging this movie to yet another movie. Same old stuff from marvel. They have become the Starbucks of the superhero genre. The basic b*tch.",
        "My fav Marvel character is there for like a minute. Its dissapointing.",
        "Avengers Infinity War what's the best are the Avengers that I've seen today 8 I enjoyed it thoroughly a highly recommended all the action and drama and all the characters were really good",
        "What a movie! This movie is exhilarating. The excitement never ends. Extremely well-crafted, with awesome characters, jokes, and action. One of the greatest endings I've ever seen in a movie.",
        "Great ending to a wonderful adaptation to the series. Well done Stan would be proud!",
        "I have no idea how this movie managed to get an 8.6. The story writing is exceptionally bad, and cliches used are dimes a dozen. It seemed a very rushed story involving too many actors and super heros. I do like super hero movies and do enjoy a good fantasy, but this was not it.",
        "With every Marvel Cinematic Universe film, the stories get better and they each get deeper. They also are getting longer, this film runs for 2 and 1/2 hours. Well worth the runtime, and you'll get a glimpse of nearly every MCU character to date, which is cool.\n\nIs the end of the MCU coming? Maybe in a few years from now (2019), it'll be epic!! The Disney studio has done a tremendous job with bringing the films from script to screen. I may be a tad biased, but the MCU is much better and higher quality than the DC universe. In twenty years, the MCU films will be remembered much better.\n\nInfinity War is a great comic book film! Watch the entire MCU to understand the story though, or you'll be lost. Happy watching.",
        "Where is the Hulk ??? OMG without hulk!!!!! Seriously now??? I think you can't make completely a good movie... I remember in the first movie Hulk when he get aggressive he became bigger and more powerful.... what are you doing???",
        "A Roller coaster ride of 2.5 hours. I don't think any other superhero movie can match this. The dialogue and screenplay was top notch especially for the character of Thanos.",
        "Not to be cerebral because this movie is not that. I had to put my input as well and agree that this film does not deserve a high rating as IMDb's users are placing it to be. This movie is tiring in both a good and bad way. Too much action crammed in a 2.5 hour movie. This story should have been serialized or someplace like Netflix where they can hash out a story in an episodic format, like a comic book. I agree with others with plot holes, but we must remember that this is a comic book movie and you have to expect that. I see where certain Hollywood producers are criticizing the comic book film genre and the constant release of these films. I feel that the genre has peaked with this movie.",
        "Movie was hell, can't belive the hype around this film. So lame and plotless. Made for the children and morons of the world. Glad every tool in the universe saw this. Hard to review this cause it has no story.",
        "Producers focused so much on visual effects and getting all the 'stars', that they forgot the important thing; the plot. Almost three unnecessary hours to get to an ending of a 'story' that stayed just as it started.",
        "Though surprisingly rich, the film's storyline remains incomplete. Feels more like several movies squished together. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" isn't a perfect film, but it's probably exactly what it wants to be. A massive spectacle full of fun character moments and impressive action sequences. It is an entertaining movie but one that leaves too many unanswered questions. Also it is too long, too dark and too confusing but the humor and all star cast helps you endure the overrunning length. On the whole, \"Infinity War\" is what fans have been clamoring for - an action movie that puts everyone under one cinematic roof, that puts all the good guys against the ultimate big bad for a better universe.",
        "...a great mashup of genres, some hilarious moments, creative action, a fantastic arc for the mad Titan Thanos, and a brilliant concoction of bringing together all the disparate threads generated over however many filmmakers and agendas over however many years. It's certainly a film that requires previous knowledge and it's certainly the first of two films but on a second watch the film breathes and its juggling of tones and steady hand under the Russo's is very clear. It's an event film and is in a class amongst the best we have these days. I was overly critical the first time but this time I enjoyed it for exactly what it was and appreciated its flow and clarity and quality. It's clever and fun and certainly a benchmark.",
        "The movie is a great example of kitsch. A definition from web: \"Kitsch is art that's garish, nostalgic, and very low-brow. Some people who love the aesthetics of souvenir culture think kitsch is really cool, while others think it's in very poor taste.\n\nKitsch is a German word that's been adopted into English, meaning \"worthless, trashy art,\" or the quality of that art. A ceramic figurine of a puppy with sad eyes is pretty kitsch, as is a velvet Elvis painting. Of course some people think that kitsch is really beautiful and fill their homes with stuff that other people consider trashy souvenirs. If your painting teacher tells you your portraits are kitsch, that's probably not a compliment.\"",

        "Hegemony is a sentimental proletarian who spares no expense in resolving this chaotic and overcrowded universe. This is not a slavery to emperor, but a retreat in the mountains and forests.

Deducting half of the population in a random way also reflects its fairness and innovation, which is simply a rare model in the boss.",
        "I don't know why there are so many positive reviews for this movie. I guess these days you jam a bunch of big stars, overdo the top special effects and a flimsy story line and you get a blockbuster movie. SMH",
        "This movie is literally the best movie out there.I was completely amazed and the russo brothers pulled off the greatest achievement of all time.This is history and will forever be.",
        "Superhero movies CAN be great. Not this one. Only giving this movie an extra star because Robert Downey, Jr. is the only good thing in this movie. This movie is WAY overrated here on IMDb. Probably fine for Marvel fan-millennials, but if you have not seen all the other movies or are over 40, my advice is to sit this one out. No plot, overuse of CGI, etc. etc.",
        "I guess I didn't really know what to expect from Infinity War but like everyone else I was stoked to see it. I must be getting tired of the Marvel Universe because I thought this movie was very mediocre. I didn't get what they were trying to do with Thanos and the kind of ridiculous ending. After the extra post credit stuff I kind of left the theater with an \"Do I really care anymore.\" I kind of got the feeling that the rest of the silent audience were either confused, stunned or didn't care either.",
        "Arguably, the best MCU movie ever made, and yes, I watched Endgame. Many people say Infinity War is the action and Endgame is the brain and I agree totally with that, but in Endgame there are many things that can be questioned, the decisions, things that did not make sense, things that can't be explained, some rushed choices and many more. But Infinity War is perfect, it is balanced, it is well written, it is action-packed and the most important thing, it never gets boring, not for a single second. There is always something happening, something big and exciting, heart pounding and stressful. There is happiness and there is grief, there is team work and there is power. Incredible re-introduction of all the characters that we've seen throughout the MCU journey with some of the most amazing visuals and CGI effects ever seen in the movie theaters.",
        "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" is a bit of an animal, packed with action, good storyline, a good smattering of humour and really good special effects. The film is packed with many hero characters, that sometimes makes the viewer struggle to work out how they all fit into the script. You have to have watched the previous Marvel movies, in sequence, to recall each characters role and \"powers\". This is a long movie, but it is an action rollercoaster. I have to say that the ending is in true Marvel movies tradition; it is like wadding through extra thick treacle, it is that slow and drawn out. But, it is clever in that it keeps the view hooked and on the edge. It seems like this is it, game over, but we shall see. As I said, this is a really good movie, perhaps the best from Marvel Movies in my opinion, I really enjoyed it. The special effects are just superb, the storyline is full of twists and turns, and all the different actors brought together works in perfect motion. Well worth watching, you will enjoy it I am sure.",
        "Its like every other superhero movie...nothing special and waaaay to over hyped!! Come on guys..you really trink this is better than fight club, Forest gump, Matrix or lotr?! It is not!!",

        "After the Thor ragnarok ending. Thanos is on his hunt for Infinity stones. Avengers are split up and without plan. Thanos has a plan, and a great one. Thanos is ready to sacrifice, but the Avengers arenot. Thanos snaps completing his destiny and removing half the life. This movie is about Thanos and all the setup that was set for him in Infinity Saga. Thanos is right in his conscious and is just watching the sunrise at his Garden!. He justifies the role of character.\n\nBlack order is weak. They couldve been more fierce. You have to deal with emotions and the deaths. This shows if you have a plan, execution and will you can do anything. and also when to strike the enemy (at their weakest) and till now they havent lost and when they lost, they lose big time.!",
        "I understand why Marvel fans like this movie, but I wasn't impressed.\n\nFrom first scene to last it is just bang, bang, crash, smash, bang! The story is very weak and there is zero character development. Maybe the characters were already fully developed over the previous 30+ movies and hence why so little attention given here.\n\nI'm just not invested in the series and so don't find the Avengers movies to be much of a pay off, but get why others do. Personally, I found it to be an exhausting, unrewarding experience.\n\nI still gave it 7/10 for its appeal to the fans, but possibly 5 or 6/10 for myself.\n\nRecommended for the fans, not anyone else",
        "I mean this was a decent movie, but come on. Ranking above \" It's a Wonderful Life \" and \"The Usual Suspects \" is bullshit. Marvel doesn't make cinematic classics, they make action filled blockbusters with no substance and 8 year old could understand. Take notes from Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, because that is a real tale of humanity, and human vulnerability in the face of action. Quit with this bull crap and give it a ranking it deserves.",

        "I was so angry after watching that I had to write something. Boring boring boring, the biggest reason for that is scenario 0/10. It is too long, if I hadn't go to cinema and bought ticket there is no way I would have patience to watch it until the end. Everything already seen in previous marvel movies, it seems that every new is even worse with lower quality and I didn't even have big expectations before the movie. The main reason I decided to watch it is IMDB rate 9/10 which is total fraud and paid advertisement. There is no guarantee if some character is dead that he will remain dead, everyone could resurrect...Go watch anything else than this. My last marvel movie for sure, so angry that I don't watch american movies in cinema any more, all the same, low quality in recent time, just to make many fast, without proper scenario...bull..it",
        "A good movie overall...but there's a few things that I just can't get over. First, the whole theory that this mighty Titan is going to reek havoc all over the galaxy so he can \"reduce the population by 50%\"...really??? All of that effort expended JUST TO DO THAT??? Well, mourn losses and have babies. So stupid it can't be overlooked. Another, Quill is NOT that stupid...to risk (50% of the pop of the galaxy). The action scenes make up for the plot stupidity...but you can't have a great movie with such silly plot holes.",
        "I was waiting for this for a long time but I have slept during the film... The animations, effects were pretty good but unfortunetly It was boring. I am not sure If I want to watch it again.",
        "Another hit by Marvel assembling the Avengers against one of the most intimidating movie villains in history - Thanos. It took them over 20 movies to get to their most defying antagonist and the wait was worth it. Josh Brolin's performance as Thanos truly stands out among a sea of Hollywood A-listers portraying characters that became iconic. The movie is a action packed thrill ride from the opening until the shocking ending and it keeps you on the edge of your seat during the whole run-time. A must watch and one of the cultural phenomenons of modern cinema which will be remembered and re-watched by generations to come.",
        "I am totally shook and mindblown. I can't believe how good and bad this movie is all at the same time. I can't believe they let the movie end the way it did but there has to be another in the works. Thanos is totally and completely pure EVIL just like the EVIL lying crooked corrupt chump trump and his family and administration. This movie will make you cheer the good guys and break your heart all at the same time. There has got to be more in the works.",
        "This movie ended up being even better than I expected and I expected a lot. Marvel is really doing their thing",
        "There was obviously a LOT of hype about this movie, but it actually lived up to it! I laughed, gasped, cheered, almost cried...It definitely helped to have seen the other Marvel movies for background, though. I loved that so many of the characters got together for the first time, and it was hilarious to see their first interactions, especially when they didn't know who each other were. The acting, special effects, music, emotion, action, humor and drama were all excellent! Can the sequel come out next weekend please?",
        "Its perfect. It gives you everything you want, it gives all the heroes perfect amounts of screentime, it has a perfect villain with motives you can understand and even support, the fights are one of the bests in the entire MCU, even despite watching it like 15+ times, I still have chills when all the heroes appear, on all the fights, when thanos gets another stone and specially on the ending. Watching this movie is literally one of the best experiences you could ever have.",
        "Another Marvel cgi stupid movie with dull dialogue, idiot characters and jokes about sex that i hate it. Pointless, stupid and cheesy violence and the cast is awful. I didn't like it. I didn't enjoy iy. Especially Guardians Of The Galaxy is terrible part. Why people like these movies? Teenagers only could appreciate this movie. It's fart, not art!",
        "Movie was good until the ending. Absolutely sucked. I would have much rather had them make a 4-5 hour movie than have them leave it like they did. After that ending I'm not sure I care to watch anymore Marvel movies. And if I do ever watch more of them I'll wait until they're on Redbox or at my local library so that way I don't have to pay an arm and a leg to potentially suffer this kind of disappointment from a movie again.",

        "This movie is so boring I had to watch it in installments. Some folks say it blows your mind but I just think it blows. I probably over-rated it as a 4 but mostly because of the special effects. Weak plot, too much jumping around, WAY too long. Even the battle scenes drug on much too long. Thinning the herd may have been the best end solution for the movie. Too bad it didn't happen in the first 30-45 minutes. I was ready to dissolve into ashes by the time the credits were ready to roll. I think the people that loved this movie beyond compare are the same folks that would wait in line for 2-3 days for the release of the new iPhone.",

        "Although I have seen it before, I am still shocked about the way it ended and how could such an evil, if you call it evil, won... That's really unexpected even if I know what is going to happen.",
        "This movie came out last year, but it hasn't changed in any way. It's still one of the best MCU movies. This movie encompasses one of the most interesting villains on-screen. Thanos decides to eliminate half the population of in the universe because he believes thinning out life will get rid of conflict for resources that would otherwise kill us. And like everyone has said by now, the CG on Thanos is fantastic. Mix that with Josh Brolin's performance and you got an amazing character. But while Thanos is the biggest part in this movie, all the other characters get plenty of screen time and each scene feels organic and the pacing has a really nice flow to it.",
        "Sure, its fun, entertaining, yeah. Top 200 movies of all time? No. This is an action packed exciting roller coaster but its not \"cinema\", it's an attraction. I feel like there should be a seperate category/platform for this type of thing as one wouldn't want to give this a bad review. Nonetheless, great finale for phase 3!",
        "Can anybody explain to me, what was good about this movie other than the special effects? I left the movie dissappointed and with a grudge against Marvel.",
        "So boring. Feel like watching stupid drama series. When I see this movie all I can do is boring and think when this gonna end.",

Nothing resembling believability in any second of the film, boring dialogue, a total excess of forgetable characters. The physics is terribly inconsistent, the cgi bad, the characters are boring. The action is just like a transformers movie, just pointless things moving around. Not only dull, but cringeworthy.",
        "I read the original Infinity Gauntlet series many years ago, and while the storyline isn't exactly the same, they did an incredible job bringing it to the big screen!\n\nThe action and portrayal of the superheroes was very well done and I was excited to see Thanos in the ending credits of so many of the Marvel movies. I knew what was coming. However, I was disappointed that Death wasn't Thanos' love interest, it still came off as exciting and fun to watch. Head and shoulders above Endgame for sure!",

        "It's amazing how differently people react to the same movie. I read the accolades this elaborate bit of silliness gets and I just don't understand it. It's a mass of dazzle in its computer graphics but with a story line for low energy morons. The story belongs in a comic book for juveniles. It's nonstop action all right but with nothing else behind it: no story, no suspense, no McGuffin. A real waste of time.",
        "Infinity War is a astonishing film which serves as the culmination of everything that occurred in MCU since the first pictures. Would seem, the movie had to turn out obscure and overloaded, but screenwriters so skillfully bring one moment to another that the movie bewitches with the first until the last minute. \"War\" connects those who didn't know about existence of each other, divides the teams which developed in the past, transfers characters from one region of the Galaxy in another, accompanying everything with grandiose battles. At the same time the narration remains clear and fascinating. Of course, if you've watched the previous movies. It's not a movie for those who want to get acquainted with Captain America, Thor, Hulk and other famous characters. The film is shot for fans, and the better you know the MCU story, the you derive bigger pleasure from viewing.",
        "Avengers Infinity War is the definition of mania. Everything just finally unravels on screen and it certainly messes with your mentality if you've been sticking around with the franchise for the past ten years. I'm more than pleased with this exhilarating MCU flick. (Verdict: A)",
        "I was disappointed. Normally Marvel produces very great movies however this one was a flunk in my opinion, to much was jammed all at once into it and not only that there was just not enough detail to storyline such as previous Avenger movies.",
        "Once you get past how cool it is to see all these characters on screen together, this movie is very lacking. The characters have no consistency, the deaths are hollow and are just there for shock value since we all know they won't say dead, the power levels of the characters and the stones fluctuate to fit what the plot needs. This is a very flawed film, but with that said I still think it's the best marvel film by far. The action and Thor's subplot are both good and Thanos is great, his character holds the movie together.",
        "This was a half-decent movie. I really like the parts that have Dr. Strange in them. If there is one criticism of this movie, it is that of the decisions of the heroes and the mistakes they make during the course of the plot. It's like they're all suffering from Bipolar and can't compose themselves or take themselves seriously enough to get a grip! I mean after all, the fate of the entire UNIVERSE is at stake!!!! Yes that is literally the plot line. I will now have to do some research because I am not a comic book guy, so this peeked my interest.",
        "After ten years you would have thought Marvel would have figured out how to craft this climax, but this easily one of the worst Marvel films I have ever seen. Plus knowing everything will be undone in the next one is just the final nail in the coffin.",
        "...maybe because of all the hype and the buzz created before the release. The 9.1 rating I saw on IMDB (on April 29) surely contributed to raising my expectations too. Great production, but it was a bit \"all over the place\". Entertaining nonetheless.",
        "First of all, some reviewers think that whoever doesn't like the move is an idiot, obviously those people are the idiots because these are only opinions, now about the movie, I didn't watch it expecting much to be honest, there is a lot of action, more than you have seen in the other previous movies, but my problem is with the plot and how the bad guy could have easily been defeated in more than one way during the movie but obviously no, which only shows to me how greedy the movie producer are, I think many people don't care if the story is bad as long as there is action, but for other people like me this is really an insult to our intelligence. I won't waste my time and money on the next one.",
        "Unpopular opinion: the Avengers movies have been suffering from the law of diminishing returns. The solo movies still work brilliantly, but the giant ensembles started collapsing under the weight of characters and plot lines right around when Ultron showed up. This one faired slightly better for a few reasons. First, the giant cast divided and conquered, allowing for A, B, C, D, and E plots - and each story worked pretty well. Second, they have introduced so many new (and funny) characters to the MCU that this edition was infused with some fresh energy and laughter. Buuuut...there were still too many characters. A movie like this cannot reach the heights of Homecoming, Ragnorok, or Black Panther. Less is more. So this film inevitably succumbed to being more about setting up future franchises than about the characters themselves. It was fun and intense, but I'm looking forward to when the stories get smaller and more focused again.",
        "Okay comic book film that is a 3 hour lead up to the next one.",
        "Waste of time...may be the most expensive, dumbest and soulless film ever made",

        "I don't recognize the THANOS The MAD TITAN from the comic books. Thanos would NOT waste his time balancing the universe if he didn't get something out of it which was Lady Death's love. Lady Death's influence with romance makes more sense. Disney's Mickey Mouse version of Thanos was easy on the Avengers. The MAD TITAN in comics books would have not been sooo fun loving and bubbly, hilarious. Thanos motive in Disney's Mickey Mouse Avengers Infinity War movie is stupid and illogical. Mickey Mouse has turned Thanos into an EMO CRYBABY. Booo!!! Kiddie Disney ruined Avengers Infinity War which is really the Gauntlet story. DIsney can't get the titles right either. Booo!\n\nMickey Mouse has taking over the Marvel Universe making all comic books for the kiddies kids and less for adults. Booo! Booo! 1/10 stars",
        "Having seen the first two Avengers movies, I really did not understand the hype with the franchise because the first two were pretty average in my opinion but then infinity war is completely different. It's amazing. The visual effects are stunning. The villain of this particular movie is what makes this movie fantastic.",

        "Avengers: Infinity War does a good job of taking moving parts from the 18 previous Marvel films and putting them together into one, cohesive machine. Each superhero gets his or her chance to shine, and Thanos holds his own as the antagonist. This movie can't really stand on its own, but is has an epic feel, as well as enough humor & action to keep fans of this cinematic universe entertained.",
        "Here they are battling a villain so strong, that all the power they have is just not enough.\n\nThey have brought in the entire marvel cast and this movie is on an epic proportion. Far outshines all the Star Wars movies.",
        "Very confusing story. In my personal opinion Thor should have long hair. Captain America should not have a beard and wear his uniform. Hulk should be more powerful than what was shown on this movie. Ironman's nano tech suit is a joke. The Avengers seem to have no powers in this movie.",
        "Why even bother having actors in these films by this point? Funny Disney can spend hundreds of millions of dollars when their only set is a big room with green walls.\n\nKudos to the seven hundred and fifty nine thousand animators on this film. Good work.",
        "I am a big fan of Marvels, but this movie was a crushing disappointment. The effects was great, and......... that's it. The movie made no sense, you'll be mostly trying to figure out what's going on even after it's done. What a disappointment!! It honestly hurts. After watching Black Panther, I was so pumped up, looking forwards to watching this film, just to get a smashing let down! I'm actually afraid of watching the next Avengers. SO crushing it is! OUCH!!",
        "Though not as bad as Black Panther, still lately the quality of all Marvel Films is rather poor and only geared to making a quick buck. Please Less Quantity but More Quality. Let's hope DC is not going in the same direction.",
        "Avengers infinity war is one of most epic comic book films ever made and it is huge in every way possible,starting with cast,epic battles and showdowns between heroes and villains,some great quotes and music and direction that was able to follow this massive story and stracture with great success,russo brothers were able to make a film that everyone thought it was impossible to made but they were somehow able to pull it of,thanos is one of best villains of recent years or he is maybe even best villain of decade,in short infinity war is epic film in every way,there is some staff that didnt work for me like some humour and black order was wasted for me,but the rest was incredible to watch and witness",
        "Finally the appearance of the best villain in the best MCU movie. There is no time to get bored, it is action from beginning to end without fillers or moments when you would like to get over how they are in many Marvel movies. It's a visual show with all the characters I've grown up with for so many years. I could sit and write an entire novel, but where would the point be? Just look at this masterpiece for you!",
        "The reason i was dumb founded with this movie was probably because i havnt seen the gaurdians of the galaxy movies , doctor strange, black panther or captain america civil war, its hard to keep track of this marvel universe , but either way this film was overblown with CGI and in my opinion this wasnt a patch on the first movie avengers assemble, the inclusion of certain characters made the film interesting to watch but overall i would say it was dissapointing with a bad ending.",
        "Explosions, eplosions and more explosions and then it ends in drama, that you don't care At All, because the characters are given so little time and so few lines, it's shamefull. No, wait. It's actually shameless treating storytelling like that. Why did they spend all this money on this hopeless scipt? I was bored so much, I left mid-movie, went to get something to eat and got back. And I didn't really miss anything. Countless plot holes, nonsensical vilain and the heroes doing constantly things contrary to their character and abilities. And don't anybody dare say these are character arcs, because they are not. If nothing else, they start from the very first scene. Usually I'm patient with superhero movies. They are supposed to be light and fun, so many sins are forgiven without second thought. I'm sorry, this was unforgivable.And not fun. At All.",
        "This movie did wonders for the MCU, it created hype for the somewhat disappointing Avengers Endgame, it left audiences at the edge of their seat during every fight as the tug of war between Thanos and the Avengers was always so violent and unpredictable that truely anyone could have won at the end of this film. Although not perfect, and suffers from multiple forced events and ever changing power levels of some characters, the 3rd Avengers film was a rightful success to the first two.",
        "I thought it would be great but sadly it was too boring",
        "This movie Is over hyped. The title of this movie should be Infinity War Part 1 & I fail to see how another 2 hours of Thanos Barnie like skin and clam shell chin will make for good entertainment.",
        "What a great movie!!\n\nEventually, we're going to run out of resources on Earth. It may take a few hundreds or thousands of years. This will mark the end of humanity, if we don't kill each other first.\n\nThat is the problem facing the human condition.\n\nThanos has a solution for that. Obviously, it is an evil one. But, I can't fault the guy for trying.\n\nComing to the movie, it is a fast paced, well structured one. Can't wait to watch the Endgame now.",
        "This movie is a lot of fun and it has great moments. It is a delight to see the crossover of Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers meet to battle the veiled villain of the last decade in the Marvel Universe. But IMO: Thanos is not the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe. His motivation is not that awesome - and in a way - by making the universe hang in the balance the film raised the stakes so high it was difficult to really care or believe. There is no real drama at the end because like any comic book...the character's will return. However - the fights are great fun. So - like any great crossover...it was big and loud but not as good as a single edition adventure.",
        "Loved this movie, the music is awesome, my grands were watching on Disney channel and it caught this granny's eye and I could not stopped watching.",
        "This movie was basically perfect. I loved every second of this beautiful story. They managed to implement so many different characters, without taking away from the big ones. The action was brilliant, the score was stellar and the visuals were stunning. This movie had so many years of buildup, it was actually so great. Thanos is one of the best villains Marvel has ever had. The calm, with which he approaches every scenario, is frightening. The ending is truly unexpected, but truly beautiful in a way.",
        "There is a giant plot hole in the first 5 minutes. Apparently there was a boarding party and the Hulk character was hiding and sneaking up on the enemy. That is very out of character. Normally the Hulk attacks first, directly, and loudly. That part didn't make any sense. Then the Hulk lost in a simple fist fight, when that character has been through much greater ordeals. Then the Asgard transporter is activated when the machine was already destroyed! Such sudden and severe plot holes really made me p-----... made me angry and I vowed to rate 1 star. That was only the first 5 minutes. How they decide who wins against whom is so arbitrary and capricious, and never follows any sort of logic or consistency. I am willing to suspend disbelief, but the writing must follow its own rules! Characters can be smashed by giant boulders, their skin never tears like its made of diamond, yet they bleed from a fist. Pure nonsense. It never occurs to Dr. Strange to use a portal to get back home, when that is half of what he does. Lazy writing. The rest of the movie was entertaining though, with even more plot holes, so I settled on 6.",
        "It is one of the best action thriller and suspense movie I ever seen .. hats off to the whole crew of this film .. lots of twist are in this movie . Movie is not peredictable . It was great experience ..",
        "One of the best movie with a fantastic story line, must watch and lots of surprises. Loved it",
        "Good memes, would watch again under the right circumstances",
        "Incredible movie. This is the culmination of 10 years of intertwining story arcs. The pacing is almost perfect which is even more impressive when you think about how many characters are in this movie!! Would recommend for everyone!",
        "Well, it is we the people who finance such utter trash by buying tickets so we might as well claim our part in promoting this stupidity! I had bought this as part of a friend's night out at the movies but we found the movie so predictable that we stepped out in the break!! Avoid!!!",
        "Just saw Avengers: #InfinityWar!!! It's EPIC!!! A Masterpiece!!! It's so amazing, brilliant and emotional!!! 10 years of hard work has paid off!!! The unsolved problems left behind. Can't wait for the next one!!! Thank you so much to everyone involved!!!",
        "This film tells the story of the ensemble of Marcel superheroes uniting to fight against an evil man called Thanos.\n\nIt is a joy just to watch the numerous famous faces in the film! The story is good, visuals are fantastic, and there are loads of fighting. It has all the elements of a blockbuster.\n\nHowever, the plot doesn't drive itself, and is not overly engaging because of the vast number of characters in different locations and subplots. It feels a bit fragmented to be. Still, I enjoyed the film a lot. By the way, the ending surprised me a little, and I guess we have to wait for the resolution of the story in the next Avengers gymf.",
        "This is INSANE. This movie is fantastic. After 18 movies, the Directors/writers had to make a decision:\n\nEither write the movie for the critics: Making clear mini arcs for all the characters (which would've been stupid and impossible), plus a theme, plus \"time for the movie to rest, quiet moments\" blah blah blah.\n\nOr write the movie that the MCU deserved. Taking advantage of all the stories, baggage, and great characters the other movies already created and presented.\n\nThank God the Russo brothers/Marvel decided correctly.",
        "Wow just wow!!! I left that cinema shocked and my mind reeling. Absolutely amazing From start to finish action packed, never a dull moment, truly amazing achievement from everyone who worked on this.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.\n\nWhat a villain! Thanos is the most terrifying villain I had seen in comic books movie -Russo's made a masterpiece scenes didn't go away from my head after the movie ended -The scenes where \"Doctor Strange\" , \"Iron Man\" and \"Spider-Man\" were together were so F Awesome! -\"Thor\" was Great! Yes I want to see \"Thor\" like that all time! -All of characters made an awesome performance .",
        "After ten years of epic waiting, we just got a chance to clarify that The Russo Brothers were an awful choice for Marvel Cinametic Universe. Infinity War, including over 30 main characters, starts with a quick plot without losing time to introduce our heroes. The movie goes on with funny bits popping out of nowhere during non-stop action sequences and sends us back home with a terrible ending. Suprisingly, it is not only bad because of lack of drama, but also the glorious fight between Avengers and Thanos brings out nothing original. The movie may serve as a great entertainment for early teens and comic-book fans, but surely not beyond that.",
        "Avengers: Infinty War is a great set up to the big finale for this saga. The characters meet each other and team up without it being forced, and the tone perfectly is set from the very beginning that s**t it hitting the fan. Thanos is not just evil, he genuinely believes hes making the world a better place. He needed to be the best villian of the series and he easily is. The things he does in this movie. Sheesh. This is his movie. These characters have come such a long way, and we got to be there for it all. Which makes it so hard to watch as they all fail, and inevitably fall. Theres tons going on but it's so well balanced. I love this chapter. The only thing I could say is some heros dont seem that strong or important but other than that...amazing. 90%",
        "Wow. I will not give any spoilers away. I will say that i have seen almost every Marvel film and this was the best ever. It blew all other Marvel and D.C. films out of the water. The Visual Effects, the story, the acting (except Ruffalo), the Easter Eggs, the humour, the feels and everything else was Kir\u00e1ly (Hungarian for king or awesome).\n\nIf you do not think this is the best Marvel film, then you obviously not a true film critic. Or maybe you have different taste than I do.\n\nI cannot wait to see it again and that is a rare statement for me.",
        "Yea, Infinity War is not a bad movie, it's semi-fun.. but that's about it..\n\nThe acting was good, the CGI was good.. but the story is too simple and straightforward.. i can't understand why anyone older than 18-19 would be raving about this movie..",
        "This was a bland mashup, suitable for viewers with short attention span. Fighting and action scenes gave way to any kind of story. Oh, yes, all stories have already been told in previous movies...? And every quarter of an hour, yet another acquaintance from DC universe enters the movie. I was expecting Harry Potter and Pippi Longstocking too, but sadly no. Save your hard earned cash, and take your family, or someone you love for an ice cream treat. That is money better spent.",
        "I am not a fan. But I do like a lot of special effects and I do like to have fun while watching this kind of movies. However, you can easily skip this one. It is the worst part in the MCU series. People giving more the 5 stars just for the special effects? C'mon. This not how it is supposed to work.",
        "Typical Avengers film. Lots of action, funny lines and unbelievable plot.\n\nDoes not deserve a 9! Cmon!",
        "This movie is so good especially the villain and how he have been introduced it's just so good I really recommend to watch it",
        "I don't know how or who rated it above 8. Really disappointed",
        "I think a movie is suppose to give you ideas, make you think, pay a better attention on what's going on around you and show some of precious things in life that we miss on these days, not just a movie about comics with zero quality of being a movie ! Despite the war and all those useless speeches in the movie what else has the movie told you ? The mindset of people nowadays is going crazy and mad, this movie does not worth that rating and I don't know why I wasted my time on this useless movie .",
        "Much better than endgame\n\nTill now since last year i watched this movie 6 times and I can watch it again and again and again\n\nStoryline with character development was amazing",
        "This film is one of the best in the history of cinema.\n\nMy rating for the movie story: 9/5 Visual effects: 7/6.\n\nEnjoyable: 8/2 Emotional: 8 To be instructive: 6.\n\nOverall score : 7/86.",
        "A blockbuster film that can't be missed and has awesome special effects",
        "Mashing all superheroes and hoping that it will work?",
        "I really lived Civil War, this was equal or better. The humor was back to were it should have gone, unlike Thor Ragnarok. Guardians Of The Galaxy actors were fun and great. Same for Iron Man. Great movie, thanks Hollywood!!!",
        "For many reasons, I did not give it a score of 10 because I do not think any film is worth the score. But let's skip this discussion. Take a look at Marvel's masterpiece: The Avengers: Infinity War.\n\nIn fact, I can say that this movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The film is like a big tree and overshadows Marvel's previous works.",
        "This movie has hit all points at the highest level. It was hilarious at some points while still being heartwrenching at others. It portrayed all of the MCU characters very well and gave all of them major rolls in the story while not overpowering any one of them. This movie took major risks and I believe that Marvel executed it to perfection. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is filled with heart, humor, and sacrifice that help redefine what a hero should be. The Russo brothers have crafted an epic of galactic proportions that will have fans contemplating long after the credits roll.",
        "Is there such a good movie seriously I thought these movies were just a myth but here it is. I will not give spoilers just saying that every movie fan should watch it.",
        "Very fun movie. Many characters are not wasted, and they all do their job. And Thanos is the greatest villain in the Marvel history. The movie is filled with shocking, impressive and fantastic scenes. This is so great.",
        "Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet -- the evil Thanos. On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment.",
        "I love the plot, but the attempts at comedy are pretty awful (namely Peter Quill, Drax, and Mantis). Their attempts at humor are very forced, not funny, and simply unnecessary. I still give this movie an 8, though.",
        "The best, #1, head honcho, big cheese, big deal, numero uno of the 4 Avengers films. You have action, adventure, insane special effects and CG work. Excellent Marvel sarcasm and interaction between the heroes. One of the best villain portrayals, without going into deep character development. So much that at times you will find yourself having emotions for a positive conclusion for the heel. Only drawback of the film is the oversized cast of good and evil participants, which may, limit the screen time for the hero or villain you want to see.",
        "So many plot holes and plot contrivances, can't believe audiences are this stupid, posibly even dumber than the moronic heroes in this movie",
        "What a lame movie. AND LAZY! How brainwashed do you have to be to look at it as some sort of an art film LMAO. This is the epitome of 21st century trash popcorn films. 100% of this piece of garbage is, well, garbage. Superhero as a genre is a laughing stock.",
        "Infinity is a brilliant masterpiece the visual effects are amazing and the story is well done the actors did a fantastic job playing their characters it's filled with action and it was just so enjoyable anyone who says this movie is bad needs a medic.",
        "As a cinephile since I'm a little little kid, and being 28 y.o. now, I have to say this is THE BEST FILM ever made, to the date, EVERYTHING IS PERFECTION, the script, the production, the cinematography, the jokes, the acting, the characters, the construction of every aspect and hue of the plot, the music, a perfect example of that human beings even we have differences, we are all in the same side, and we have to let those differences aside and join to defend what is right, no matter what, it's an example of courage, human values, sacrifice for others, IT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE to teach and educate kids, about how important is the respect to each other, MAGNIFICENT! it leaves you a message, a beautiful and powerful message, unlike the over-hyped GODFATHER, that doesn't leaves you anything except a bad taste about deaths and crime, no teaching, nothing.Avengers: Infinity War It's like the perfect movie I've been expecting all my life without even knowing it, 10 OUT OF 10, MASTERPIECE.Period.",
        "If you like watching essentially the same movie being re-released every 4 months with a different character in a slightly different colour of spandex going through the exact same story arch as the last hero in an incredibly repetitive formulaic experience, then this is for you... If you like original, thought provoking movies that test you're senses and deliver new experiences, with strong well built characters, unique stories, excellent acting and ground-breaking directing... Then you won't like this. Another year, another endless array of comic book movies; there's a reason non of them never get nominated for best picture & it's not a good one.",
        "I've enjoyed most of the Marvel Universe films but I wasn't as taken with this, basically a little of everyone's favourite characters, but equally not enough of everyone's favourite characters combined to make a slightly less than memorable movie.\n\nOne thing though, this was a movie with a message that humanity cannot continue wasting the resources of this planet or face the loss of at least half of what we have on this little planet of ours. Credit for that as we need to wake up to a very harsh future if we carry on as is.",
        "Perfectly balanced! Russo brothers done a fantastic job. I had doubts how will they present all the heroic characters in one movie. But they nailed it!! Love you guys.",
        "The infinity war is about constant fight and That's it. I hope these fans restore their rationality soon. If this title truly deserve the current rating in the history of cinema, it is the end of the cinema. And perhaps a new era has began: mindless passive Consumerism.",
        "This is the my favourite movie. I Love it. Thank you Marvel for giving such a Masterpiece...... This movie has no comparison with the other movies because I already said that This is the Greatest Movie of All Time.",
        "This movie are so bad from all another avengers movie. All movie is work in space and they get Guardians for this,so now we see they dont have no more ideas just copie from another movies. Stupid film ever",
        "Thanos takes it to the another level. Absolutely stunning.",
        "What. A. Waste.\n\nNo plot. Terrible movie. Super long",
        "The best thing I can compare Avengers: Infinity War to is a high speed roller coaster. From the first action sequence to the last the viewer is flung around various battles, universes and emotions. Thanos was much better developed than I expected, and seeing many characters from different films finally interact was rewarding for those who have been watching MCU films since they first came out. While IW was not the best or deepest super hero movie I've seen, it is unlike any other cinematic experience I have ever had. It's easily the closest I've felt to reliving Saturday morning super hero cartoons in theaters, especially with the \"to be continued\" ending. I was expecting pure fun and I got exactly that. Can't wait for the next one.",
        "SPOILER: Every comment I've read from a 1 Star to a 3 star have ALL stated they hate all Marvel movies. So let me just ask the obvious... why do you bother in the first place? Second, many of you have stated there's no plot. Have you not seen the 29 movies prior or is this your first marvel movie? I'm guessing this is your first. Lol This movie was a treat. I honestly expected to be disappointed and boy was I wrong. I tried to critique it and judge it harshly and I can honestly say this film won my heart. It had that Bane from Batman feel and as much as I hate to admit it... I like when the bad guy accomplishes his mission once in a while. It's satisfying. Not because I'm pure evil or anything but because it goes away from tradition or the norm. It's bold, daring, and a fun ride. If this is your first marvel movie or you think there's no plot do everyone a favor and don't comment.",
        "This movie a little overrated. It is a good movie. But really is no Avengers age of Ultron. It has good acting. The story line could have been better. The first movie of the Avengers it a lot better.",
        "I spent many of hours reading comics in my early years and watched television try to bring some characters to life. tho i was excited as Spiderman, Captain America & the Punisher got shots at entertaining the viewers, we were never in awe of the special effects available today. and here we are 40 some years later, the characters have been squeezed into a few hours of viewing. superheroes with identities that the whole universe recognize (oh yeah, they show peter parker keeping his identity hidden - from his aunt, everyone else can know, just not his aunt) when i heard Marvel was creating the screened universe, the possibilities of where we cold explore only to watch how they have transformed into an unstable mass of special effects to glorify production companies, i guess the only reason i watch them anymore is to see Stan Lee at least participate in the products he founded",
        "The Russo brothers are just fantastic at directing these types of films. And for one I love this ending, this ending is better than any other MCU film. One of my top 5 favorite MCU film up to date. Loved it and I just can't wait for Avengers 4. 10/10",
        "With the beggining of the movie it was full of surpises. What I really liked in the movie was the serious tone and the real threat hanging over the Avengers. Yes...this is THANOS ! He is an amazing villain ! MARVEL Studious show us once again that their production are spectacular visual!",
        "It took me some time to watch this. Overall a good experience but this is not a film in the traditional sense...Sure, it's overwhelmed with liberal preaching and awesome action, but at the end of the day, it's more of a filler. Cheap thrills don't work on me, sorry, not sorry.",
        "Marvel has not followed the comics closely or consistently, hence the reason this film caught me so off guard...it was like GOT on steroids. The body count is ridiculous! People go to the movies to be entertained, this movie is no fun! Most people left the premiere looking stunned or irritated.",
        "Much more engaging and far superior to its predecessor Avenger films...Infinity War is the movie we were all waiting for . 10 years build-up and it came down upon us, with sheer epic scale and gut-punching resolutions. It may over-entice its somewhat bloated array of storylines with somewhat unbalanced character dynamics along the way. But this is not meant to be an ordinary film. It's a Super Smash Brothers Brawl type feature and a blockbuster like no other. Reaching places visually and emotionally that this MCU franchise finally needed to take. Carried by a fabulous performance by Josh Brolin as Thanos, he makes this movie his own, as the Avengers are just there to do their best. But is their best enough. Such an epic experience. It's an event more than a film, and be sure to ready your expectations. Because the Russo's send us off with pure cinematic, shakespearean-esk illuminations. Setting up for maybe an even better Avengers sequel. But let's just hope they don't get too predictable on us. One for a generation. What an experience.",
        "Had great expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed. Tons of action and special effects, but I found myself getting bored. And the ending was horrible. Everyone around me in the theater seemed to have the same reaction. And the comments I heard afterwards seemed to echo my opinion. Sorry I rushed out to see it opening weekend. Won't be surprised if box office results drop dramatically next weekend as word of mouth gets around.",
        "It's not often I write reviews but I had to for this unbelievable masterpiece. It had me riveted from start to finish and made me forget all of the troubles I currently have in my life. I couldnt wait to see all the amazing characters one by one and for the next bit of amazing action, one after another and so relentless. I get bored very easily so when something can keep me so mesmerised for so long it has to be good. My only complaint is that I have to wait far too long to find out what happens. This is by far the best super hero film ever made and for me one of the best films I've ever seen. I'd give it 20 out of 10 if I could. Fantastic. It makes the DC films (which I like) (I'm a big superman fan) look like cheap made for TV rubbish.",
        "This film is pretty good and shoking And itis best avengers movie",
        "Movie is just the average one. Not very exciting or enthusiastic other than spiddy character. Lot of useless scenes to get the viewers engaged. One time watch movie if you have watched all the Marvel movies.\n\nNot to spoil I'll keep it short movie is overratted. One time watch and forget movie. You could save your precious time not watching it though.",
        "Disappointing. Simply and enough said. Do not recommend.",
        "I have never felt so emotionally exhausted after watching a Marvel movie, but Avengers: Infinity War had me experiencing all sorts of emotions. Sadness, hope, despair.\n\nEveryone left the cinema, spellbound, each reaching for the phone to find out if there was an explanation for anything that happens to the movie characters, and most importantly what the ending means.",
        "That's all I am ever going to say about Avenger movies. Pure trash and garbage. Don't watch this, don't let your kids watch it. Pure trash trash trash.\n\nThat's it. Nothing good to say here.\n\n1 Stars",
        "If you are someone who likes watching fireworks shows this special-effects saturated epic might be your cup of tea. But I had to constantly resist the urge to check my phone messages. I have to say the ending was unexpected and Marvel deserves plaudits for switching things around. The rest, unfortunately, was a pretty standard superhero movie.",
        "Boring, plot makes no sense, characters make stupid choices, nothing is explained well. I don't understand how anyone can watch this and think that it's good. It did have nice special effects though.",
        "This movie sucked bad just like all Marvel it's a same thing over and over there was a couple good Marvel movies",
        "Generally with superhero movies you know your hero will win, and as a result the viewer couldn't care less about the story. Why care when you know it will work out in the end? Infinity war tropes that stereotype and gives the viewer new interest into the super hero world that may not always end with puppies and rainbows.\n\nThis is a great movie that tells an in-depth story line of interpersonal relationships while maintaining the action of the story, something extremely hard to do. Thanos was a well constructed villain who truly did make you afraid for the heroes we hope will prevail.\n\nThis one will go down in the record books.",
        "This is personally one of my favorite Marvel movie cause it has pretty much all the Marvel characters. The plot is pretty good. This movie has many good fighting scenes, but the movie also has some funny scenes that at least made me laugh. I think that you get the best experiment with having watched all the previous movies, BUT it\u00b4s not that hard to understand what\u00b4s going on after about 30 minutes to the movie. The end of the movie is a bit depressing, but aside from that it\u00b4s a great movie.",
        "This movie is a very long series of special effects bonanzas / fights and THAT'S IT. It has no purpose - virtually no plot - is endlessly frustrating and at the end feels like you have been promised a trip to Disney World - and you get all excited ( by the marketing / trailers etc . . ) and so you drive for several hours and along the way people in your Car keep being killed in front of you and thrown out of the Car - and right at the end of the trip someone throws YOU out of the Car onto a long desolate road and drives off. SERIOUSLY. That is what watching this incredibly over hyped movie is all about. The VACUUM of EMPTINESS.",
        "If you are gonna watch this then do not waste your money, make it free, it is not worth \u00a315 or $19. The whole thing was a big CGI fight and bored me to hell. Thanks Marvel. Thanks.",
        "Here we go, Marvels never fail me! another 10!, The story line is very good, all Major characters are all highlighted which is very important. CGI is very good as well... I love it. Now, I can't wait for the next sequel 2019.. Hoping to see a new member!",
        "Terrible CGI, so many plot holes, I almost fell asleep in the theater because of how boring movie was, all the characters going to come back so they can make more money off of this stupid franchise. Adventures infinity war is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen it is a cluster of characters that I used to care about, not anymore.",
        "Overly long and full of essentially nothing but CG battles, this movie has to squeeze in every character from all of the other movies into a wafer thin plot (bad guy wants to kill 1/2 of all life) - - - snore. Oh but wait, they \"humanize\" the villain by having him cry once... wow THAT' S SO DEEP, WHATTAMOVIE! It's so sad that children's stories about people punching each other are all that we get in theatres now... but the crowd had a good time, so if you love these MCU movies, you'll probably love this. If you're over/bored of them, this won't change your mind.",
        "You will not be disappointed with this movie.I love every character in this movie",
        "The visuals were great, the music was great and there was some good humour. I like a lot of the previous marvel films. In this movie, I was confused in almost every scene. I felt that the characters' capabilities seemed different from what I saw in earlier movies and, a lot of the time, their actions/choices were bizarre and unfounded. I was often thinking \"Why did...?\" \"and How on earth did...?\" \"Whaaat?\" Having so much of this confusion in the fast-paced, action-packed movie ruined it for me :( I wish it happened otherwise...",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is by far Marvel's most ambitious film ever. And it mostly pays off, after 10 years of buildup. With incredible effects, masterful sound design, great characters complimented by a fantastic cast, and some of the best action in marvel films. However it's uneven tone, some unfocused characters, and probably some of the worst comic relief in a Marvel film hold it back from being a great film. Nonetheless, the end result is a blast from start to finish, that should satisfy fans.",
        "This movie deserves no more than a 7 on IMDB. I could maybe still handle a 7.5. Maybe. Compare it to the greats that scored over 8 people. Cmon really? It is a slightly above average marvel movie, that's it.",
        "Sorry...walked out feels my like I had just seen a DC movie. Depressed and forlorn.",
        "Truly epic, the direction of the movie, the directing of the movie, the writing, the acting, the action, Josh Brolin as thanos, it's all amazing, however there are certain aspects of the movie that I did not like, but they are spoilers, so I won't be saying what it is.",
        "The movie had its moments but overall was a let down. The plot at its basic level is a good story line but the surrounding elements are bad. The humor which is usually stellar in the Avengers movies is poorly timed and poorly delivered. The story is disjointed and feels like they wanted to cram as many superheroes into the film as they could regardless if it made sense. \"Two minutes for you and six minutes for you and three minutes for you.\" Hopefully the second movie will be the saving grace.",
        "Such a waste of money, not mine, but 321 millions of dollars to make a movie like this? Not to mention the cast full of stars.\n\nAlleatory, forced jokes,tiring.\n\nI'm not huge fan of super hero's movies, but this one managed not to achieve my not to high expectation of a minimally interesting and engaging plot",
        "Yes, it is too long, yes it has too many characters all vying for attention and yes the story is convoluted by bad blood, family matters and missing elements. Yet it is still a must see and you will.",
        "The visualization is really impressive. But the story sucks. Marvel is ruining the reputation by putting all the superheroes together without a whole story.",
        "I'd be a diehard Marvel fan. I've seen every one of these movies... sometimes I went to the theater... sometimes I just waited till it was made available and I could watch whenever for free. No matter where or how I saw them I almost always walked saying the same thing... Eh. When Iron Man came out I was still a teenager and I really enjoyed it... but after that it was honestly the most mature of the films until Infinity War or should I say Marvel's Dark Knight LOL! Still had all the Marvel humor but was much darker or really deeper than anything Ive seen from this studio. I bet DC has to be feeling pretty embarrassed about Marvel's CG villain!! Holy crap. Seriously DC... and i'm a fan but go back to the drawing board bc Thanos just literally shamed everything you've done since Dark Knight Trilogy. Obviously I won't spoil anything but I definitely had tears in my eyes at the end... not because I love everything Marvel but bc I was truly that moved. This was a hard earned 10/10... all credit due to the directors Joe and Anthony Russo! The years of hard work I'm sure went into this REALLY SHOWED. Inspiring.",
        "Heros complexes x100... please change story. We have the same disk running for over a decade with hero movies please stop.",
        "More mindless nonsense terrible cgi animation and no story of any interest. Kids dig this crap. We are encouraging a generation of idiots. Get back to making real movies Disney. You used to be so good at it!",
        "Do Not Go See \"Avengers Infinity War\" IF You Want to See the Ending of the movie!!! The Ending is in the sequel: May 3, 2019!!! It's a dirty little trick that I think will reduce the otherwise grandiose profits. Marvel, this was an unwise move. Word will spread. Now people will be overly cautious about your movies. Serial cliffhangers went out with Edison, the Weiss Brothers, and Flash Gordon.",
        "This was the best Avengers yet. Would highly recommend",
        "Before Infinity War for me Thanos is just another genetic looking villian for me so i don't know how much this movie do the him justice but what i do know is he slowly becoming my favorite villiant of the MCU.Infinity War is depressing as hell everytime the heroes get a tiny bit of chance Thanos crush it into dust with his ultra OP weapon The Infinity Gautlet.His ideals of bringing balance to the universe is so wrong on many levels but the fact that he believe that is the only way is what make Thanos so scary and interesting.For more than 10 years the long string successful of the MCU still continue with Infinity War so let see how much they can offer us in another 10 years.(P/S.The best dark storyline of Marvel so far is still Logan btw)",
        "So this is the quintisential super hero movie. A bit of comedy, but not too much, and not enough to make the movie funny, a bit of plot but it is all over the place and mostly made out of plot holes and idiocy, and lots and lots of action for action sake, all leading nowhere in the end.\n\nThere is some hope a follow up movie can make this part of greater arch, but as it stands on its own, it is just too inconsistent to give you that punch in the gut it was trying to set you up for.",
        "This is the Marvel movie that should be getting 7 Oscar nominations. This is better than Black Panther in every aspect, but it isn't a political film so it won't get the love it deserves",
        "There are not many critical reviews here, so I decided to shift the balance a little. I actually like super hero movies, but maybe they have outlived their novelty value. This is just a bunch of ridiculously costumed characters with a series of funny (not!) stereotype lines and a single character excuse for fight scenes. After half an hour of suffering I stopped watching.",
        "Wasn't the best marvel movie but still very enjoyable to watch. Was better than black panther though which only got great reviews from critics bc of diversity.",
        "I love the original Avengers movie, mostly down-to-earth people with a few special butt-kicking skills - I have never been a fan of the Star Trek style other-world alien thing, green people and talking animals just bore me. This movie is mostly not set on Earth, so it lost my interest quite quickly. And then the ending... Marvel, I've never been so mad at a movie. So so so disappointed with what you just did there. I actually wanted my money back.",
        "Quite disappointed. Too much going on, too many heroes to follow. Who is the protagonist? Iron Man? Thor? Star Lord? Dr. Strange? Who do I follow? All of them? They have tried to recreate the impact of the original avengers when they all join up but times by 5. Unfortunately it flops. I will watch Endgame because I have already committed this much but just have to say Stan Lee should not have signed off on any of this.",
        "Great acting , great 10 Years stories , awesome graphics. And a lot of talented actors. Best movie of the year 2018 Good job Marvel I have enjoyed the spectacular movie :)",
        "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch the Avengers trying to defeat the powerful Thanos with the help of their allies. They have to try hard in order to defeat him and they have also to work together to succeed.\n\nSince I had already watched the previous Marvel movies, I have to admit that I was expecting this movie and I had high expectations by it, and I was not disappointed. It had an amazing plot that contained some plot twists that made it very interesting and also plenty of action and suspense. The direction which was made by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo was simply amazing and they succeeded on making the audience follow their characters and be with them through the whole duration of the movie. Regarding the interpretations of the cast each and every one of them was also very good and did their best to have this beautiful result. Finally, I have to say that \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is the ultimate action science fiction movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.",
        "I don't give very many movies a 10 ... actually none at all, besides this one. The reason is, there is not really a dull moment in the movie. I actually cheered and clapped at one point in the movie. You'll know when it happens ;). The action is there, the comedy is where it should be. They did a great job in balancing out all the marvel characters into this amazing movie. If you haven't seen it yet and are reading these reviews to see whether or not \" it's the movie for you.\" Do you self a favor to all of us. Don't see it. You my friend are not worthy. :). Just watch it ! Thank you for everyone who participated in making this movie possible. They don't get the credit they deserve. Hats off to you. Be proud. When sitting through the credit remember the people's names across the screens cause they contributed to movie history. I thank you.",
        "Is the movie worth watching? Yes. Is it deserving of a 8.9? No. It is a good movie?Sure. Are there plot holes/issues? Yes. What percentage of the film is CGI? 90%. Would I pay $20 to see it in theatres again? No. Would I buy it in an $5 Walmart Bin? Probably Not. Would I watch it again? Yes",
        "What a terrible film. no story. hysterical action. awfull",
        "It's a blast when a film not only meets expectations, but exceeds them. This uses the whole toolkit that the Marvel films have accumulated over the years, and finds exactly the right mix of familiar and new, humor and drama. It's like a runaway freight train but it knows that and does nothing to take away from the rush of being on board. Great stuff.\n\nAs far as specifics, the new combinations of characters are a joy, it's confident and intrepid visually and the rationale of why the villain is doing what he does comes across better than one would expect. There are a couple of scenes that seem contrived to push a lever for the story, but in such a grand scheme, hardly worth mentioning. This is far better than Age of Ultron, a real return to form for the Avengers.",
        "While this movie was terrific with tons of special effects and battle scenes, the jumping from planet to planet to magic places to past and present was very confusing... The cgi and battles were awesome, but the acting was so so and cliche. The worst was the horrible confusing ending which made absolutely no sense.. My wife and I both yelled WTF when the credits started, because the movie was surely NOT over... So lame of an ending.. I still do not know what happened... Very disappointed in this one compared to the other ones.",
        "For me, the worst Avengers to date. What's this movie? The first of many to come in a series? I do not know. It's by far the weakest scenarios of all the Avengers series. I gave it a 3/10 for those reasons. Very dissapointed and bad movie.",
        "This is by far the best Marvel film since the winter soldier.",
        "If you're someone who only needs fancy cgi and lots of explosions to enjoy a movie, this is for you. If you like movies that aren't lowest-common-denominator written-by-comittee kids movies, this is not for you.",
        "A bloated smorgasbord of uninteresting protagonists (save Iron Man) fighting an oaf with magic crystals. Not to mention, an overzealous color pallete and use of CGI that left me longing to stare into a dark, bottomless pit for hours. The obligatory Marvel laugh lines were embarrassingly stale, though inexplicably humorous to the audience. From the cheap moments of social awkwardness or the annoying insecurity of Quill vis a vis Thor, I found myself constantly groaning. I say all this recognizing Justice League was also hot garbage, but at least a few of the characters were interesting. Oh how I miss those halcyon days of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy - where the drama prevailed and the characters were worth caring for. Batman v. Superman had it's flaws (Martha!) but at least it's got heart! I found myself checking my watch less than an hour into Infinity War. This crossover was indeed too ambitious.",
        "I thought it would be more mediocre, but in the end, I can say that the whole movie was breathtaking and definitely lived up to its hype.",
        "Honestly, what made this movie truly spectacular and unique was the writing and the pacing which will keep you wanting more.",
        "This movie was so jam-packed with story, dialogue, and events that calling it a movie might be an understatement.",
        "Great film! No spoilers so not much else I can say. Cannot wait for next chapter! When does the next one come out?",
        "Thanos was on a mission, and it was a terrifying one. The way Josh Brolin carried the Thanos character made the movie very awesome.",
        "Thanos' quest to find all the Infinity Stones and his mission was what made him a greater villain than any other from the past Marvel movies.",
        "I'm hoping they can pull it back on the right track with the sequel.",
        "I know this is just another super hero flick or maybe an eye candy for most of adult audiences; however, this movie is sure damn good. Acting, visuals, story were on point and it sure was worth my money and time to watch it in the theatre for 2hrs and 30mins! Don't listen to negative reviews or critics i assure you that if you are a serious or a casual movie goer, marvel fan or dc fan or whatever.. you will enjoy this movie from beginning to an end!",
        "I've read the original comic book trilogy countless times as a kid and I was trying real hard to keep my expectations low for this movie so my inner super fan kid would not be disappointed. But it totally delivered and is a worthy culmination of what Marvel started with the first Iron Man movie.",
        "I wished that the end will be unexpected and it was.... I am sure that i will be waiting for the next chapter Incredible ending I was afraid to blink my eyes to miss any second of it.",
        "It just destroyed the image of the previous Avengers movies. It was simply waste of time and money.",
        "I keep hearing about how complex and unique villain and how philosophical it is, so I decided to give it a chance. I'll be honest and note that as far as I'm concerned comic books are among the lowest forms of media, and the movies all feel more or less the same. I've always been a fan of second chances so I watched it with a friend and by the end it felt like we had seen two different movies. It was just another generic superhero ensemble movie with extra pretentiousness and angst, thanos was just a madman who convinced himself he was rational. It just further shows that being a nerd doesn't automatically mean you're smart, I can't wait until Hollywood gets past it's nerd phase...",
        "Merely 5% is real life images, the rest were virtual. The story unconnected, boring, the end surprisingly unended, to be continued... it doesn't deserve the 9 star rating, who paid it?",
        "I think that marvel is very smart , I advise everyone to see this movie you will never regret Believe me",
        "Wow wow wow. Yes. I didn't think they would meet my expectations but they did. I just came from seeing it in theaters an hour ago but I'm definitely gonna re-watch this entire week. Marvel has knocked it out of the park with not only a legendary film that honestly lives up to its legend but also as the best Avengers film yet.",
        "I love it. Everything in the movie, except for a visual effect shot with Bruce Banner in the Hulkbuster suit near Avengers: Infinity War's ending, is perfect. The stakes are higher and, for me, Thanos is the MCU's best and most compelling villain than Killmonger and Hela.",
        "It's nice seeing a superhero movie where the heroes don't win in the end.\n\nWas expecting to be bored but enjoyed it throughout. Long drawn out action that stays fresh throughout.\n\n4/5.",
        "It does not matter how much of a fan you are, this movie is generic, lowest denominator entertainment. It's fine, but does not deserve its current rating of 9.1. Are you guys kidding? This is as good as The Godfather or Shawshank? Please. I'm sure it'll drop to a more appropriate rating when the hype dies down.",
        "It felt like this part was just a merger of all Marvel super heros with no powerful subject/story line and they just tried to give a gist of what we can expect next from the series, it felt like a total crap. It felt like they wasted not using the super heros to their core. But the visuals were amazing and the villian/Thanos was stagerring. That was all.",
        "All the hype made me go to a theater to watch this. Well... what can I say, it is just like 200 other super hero films. Iron-man firing missiles, spider-man jumping around, etc. There is a villain, very strong villain... and what it is that he wants......? He wants to kill half of the population. Why? Because he thinks there is too much people! What!? A villain that is worried about the environment..... he must be from the green party, maybe he is vegan. Anyway... No story whatsoever, but 2 hours of action scenes and good effects (my wife was sleeping after 1 hour)... maybe good for teenagers.",
        "This movie was so epic and got my heart pumping throughout the movie. This movie is about the villain, Thanos, trying to snap half of the population off of the face of the planet. It tells a great story with great acting and actors. As always, Robert Downy Jr. was great and so was Tom Holland. The movie seemed to build up on Tony Stark's and Tom Holland's relationship. Overall, wonderful movie with great acting!",
        "Infinity war had the best cgi in a movie ever,it felt so much like a thanos movie and will forever be a classic it was the biggest crossover in history to date, its deserving of its 8.5 score but should be higher the endgame thanos was such a well developed villain that felt more like the hero his CGI was unbelievable everything from the veins to the hairs thanos is the best CGI character I've seen",
        "'Infinity War' is overrated. It's entertaining, but I was expecting more. I can't even believe it's somewhere at the top of the best 250 movies list. The direction was OK, definitely not as good as some say, but the storyline was a bit of a mess. Each character was in a different planet fighting for different stuff. I think it was too risky wanting to put together so many superheroes in one movie. We didn't even get to see Captain America or Black Widow for more than 15-20 minutes, in a 2h30m long movie. I was also hoping for a more epic final battle, like in the first Avengers movie. This one was too short and messy. Maybe we'll get to see a better one in the next film. I still think the movie is for teenagers and kids...",
        "I'd say about 7/8ths of this movie is topnotch and worth watching. It misses the mark a little near the middle of the second half, but not catastrophically. Altogether it's a uniquely imaginative and ambitious ride. The action is pretty much non-stop and each actor's contribution takes the whole production a little bit higher. I would not have thought this kind of group effort possible, but it's almost as if everyone in the production felt the need to give it their all. Kudos to the directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, who have never tackled such a large project before. They definitely have the sensibilities and eye to make a movie rock.\n\nIf I had to rank the performances, I'd have to say Chris Hemsworth, Zoe Saldana, Benedict Cumberbatch, Josh Brolin and Chris Pratt were my personal favorites though I'd hate to do without any of the rest.",
        "Infinity War was very predictable for us who read the comics, that is a small critic. Dinklage was out of place, Black Widow felt unnecessary, and Hulk was mistreated horribly. A lot of things was missing as well, and a few decisions did not really work.\n\nWith that said though it was fantastic entertainment, great movie experience, and top 5 marvel movie.\n\nAlso if you are a green party member and you want to kill humans because in your psychotic world there are too many people, you will love this movie beyond compare.\n\nOne of the most entertaining movies ever made and a fantastic superhero movie, but as a movie (in general) it had too many problems to get top grade.",
        "So how many times can you make a movie with the exact same plot. Apparently, as many times as you want . Seriously, too many of these movies, the studies should be investing in something more original and new. I started watching this and I could tell what was going to happen after 5 minutes. I won't be watching anymore of these movies.",
        "This movie is such a disappointment that I don't know where to start: 1) Lack of story line 2) Disorienting camera work in fight scenes 3) Zero amusing/comical value scenes\n\nThis movie doesn't give you anything to keep you engaged. I fell asleep 3 times during the movie and couldn't wait to get out the show. I have thoroughly enjoyed other Avengers movies and Thor Ragnarok recently. This has just been the worst Marvel movie to date.\n\nOnly thing going for it is that you can see all the Marvel superhero characters at once.",
        "Compared to the original story that started with Infinity Gauntlet, this one was very swallow, specially due to the absence of Adam Warlock. Too many jokes, poor story and too many characters simply thrown in the story and used in a very bad way made this a mediocre movie at best.",
        "Same CGI villain like that Steppenwolf, but Thanos is much much more\n\nRecent marvel villains have been awesome Like Killmonger, Loki, Ultron, and now Thanos\n\nNot only powerful physically, but has interesting personality, and somewhat relatable If you just recently watched the movie \"What Happened to Monday\" then you might even support Thanos' actions\n\nThat's it about Thanos Now to the movie itself\n\nIt lived to the hype Not in the way that people predicted, but the epicness most likely satisfy everyone Not gonna spoil, go watch it Though I'm sure most of you have gotten the ticket already lol~",
        "What an incredible film. After watching every movie in the series, to see them come together like this is really something special.\n\nFor the first time, this felt like an experience rather than a film.\n\nWhat they did with Thanos here is nothing short of brilliant.\n\nLoved it.",
        "Film was entertaining, ive watched all marvel movies multiple times. This film is great fun but is far to rushed, of cause with so many characters involved was always going to be a tough one to do, part 2 may improve it.\n\nHappy i saw in Imax but would def wait till on tv to watch again. overall an entertaining but average film with lots missed, nothing special and worse than some of the stand alone movies.",
        "Grass grow in my back yard. Damn, what a long drawn out fight to nothing.",
        "A common correlation I have seem with the poorly rated reviews for this movie seem to be coming from people that obviously haven't seen the previous movies. If you don't know that there weren't 31 movies before this, then you don't know marvel enough to give an accurate review. I understand if you don't know the exact number but you should know that there isn't 31. I can even understand if you don't feel like watching the previous 18 movies before coming to see this one, but then don't give a review on a movie you don't fully understand. But I can't hate on you too much, you gave this film your money so thanks for that, and thanks for keeping this great studio alive because I can't wait for what's to come!",
        "Movie is eye-catching from start to finish, it's packed with action and with all our beloved characters we got to meet through the years. It's different from the comics, but in a good way, story fits this specific universe, and Thanos, in my opinion, is much more complex and interesting character than who got to meet in the comics. Visuals are well done, music is thrilling, especially at the end, crossovers are done in a great way, everything fits and connects the way it should.",
        "Test addresse. Test addresse. Test addresse. Test addresse. Test addresse. Test addresse.",
        "Overall, I liked this movie. It was fun, awesome, and a great watch. I was worried that this would be another huge dissapointment for me like Civil War was, where the trailer was better than the movie. I have to say, they handled his movie pretty well. Still, there are huge pacing issues but it's a comic book movie with a lot of characters so i've got to give it a pass. But my biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't feel like an \"Avengers\" movie- they're all split up and such. The theme barely plays and when it does it doesn't feel quite right. The Russos don't really understand what the Avengers are, based on this movie. It doesn't feel quite as complete as the previous two. Well, this was a good movie, worth the hype, but I hope they improve for the next and final one. Part 2 is usually better, right?",
        "Compared to Justice League's Steppenwolf, the main villian is a bit more fleshed out. What doesn't help is, that his motivation and plan are super dumb if you think about it. The execution also doesn't make much sense.\n\nThe story is full of cliches and non-sensical plans and most dead people surely will return soon again. This movie is 90% CG, some of it very bad and I could believe of even the soulless script was computer-generated",
        "This is a 2018 masterpiece! All the acting, storyline creation, world creation, directing - EVERYTHING is a masterpiece! It is one of my favourite movies of all-time. Once you feel the action calmed down a second later it hits you in the face with double the emotions! Recommend to everyone. Watch it after all the previous marvel films for the best experience.",

        "100 minutes of a glorified Guardians of the Galaxy movie followed by a too long battle scene by which i'd checked out. The ending bits were unsatisfying with an ending that just left you with no resolution. Basically 150 minutes of your life where nothing happens or is resolved.",
        "I enjoyed all of the Avengers movies, but this one was very disappointed.",
        "This is Movie that lead to Avengers Endgame! It was beautifully shot and great story to tell!!! ALL AROUND AMAZING CAST AND VOICES!!!!",
        "This movie is dope and insanely good. I love how the characters clearly portray the role that is given to them",
        "I do enjoy the Marvel films, I have loved every Avengers film and make no mistake this has the lot, most characters are here and maintain the comedy and pace. This is an amazing film and I am now on my second viewing and will continue to watch. It's almost like a tasting menu at a top restaurant, each section and every course whets the appetite for the next course, every course compliments the other and adds to the anticipation. The truth is that by the end of the film, it's almost as though I'm full to exhaustion. Don't get me wrong, I think this is an extroidinary film and a breathtaking feat, I just wonder what course comes next.",
        "This was truly spectacular!! A lot more (excellent) humor than I perhaps expected, although it lessens when it goes down for some great emotional moments. And A LOT of shit goes down. the action set pieces are amazing and a lot of fun to watch.\n\nThanos is also easily up there as one of the best and most menacing villains seen so far. I loved what they did with Peter Dinklage!\n\nThat said, I can easily imagine the movie being hard to follow for those not well versed with the MCU, however, I think they do a pretty good job switching between the different groups.\n\nI'll definitely be rewatching this in the near future.",
        "I left the theater like \" no! No! It can't be!!\" No spoilers here, but oh my goodness what a film! I was literally on my seats edge. There are so many questions I need answering now. Even with the going in and out of scenes it all stayed together, it was very cohesive. Just crazy good.",
        "This film could have failed in many ways, especially if the writers dulled the stakes, but that is the opposite of what they did. This film is tense, dark, hopeless, yet humorous. The film takes risks that will no doubt leave audiences shocked and by doing this alone has made it a revolutionary comic book movie. The characters, the action, the acting, and the setpieces are all done marvelously, and the villain, Thanos, is one of the most intense and frightening villains in Marvel film history and possibly in Cinema as a whole. Whenever he is onscreen you feel as though all hope is lost and that our heroes are in great peril, making this a thrill ride of a film that must be seen. I was not expecting what I got, but leaving the theater, I was absolutely speechless.",
        "Indeed my favorite Avengers Movie till maybe I watch 'EndGame'. Had some dull moments but if the action comes it's really a good and memorable one. Thanos is indeed good and my favorite character in the movie. This movie is a must watch for all Marvel fans period!!",
        "Take a 15 minute Captain Planet episode and stretch it out to three dreadful hours of CGI fight scenes of people you don't care about. There is nothing to keep someone over the age of 13 interested. The plot is nonsensical. Big flashes, loud noises, and cramming in every Marvel superhero for a 2minute scene just made the movie seem like one endless \"star\" cameo after another. Avoid",
        "This has it all and is head and shoulders above Endgame or any other Marvel movie. Action from minute 1, great set pieces, humour, best MCU villain of all time and what an ending, was genuinely shocked and moved even tho I had read the comics and kind of knew what would happen. Nothing much more to write, great movie",
        "There is literally no way to dislike this movie. People complain about humor. Use your brains and you will see that the humor is necessary yet high quality. There are no mistakes in any of the aspects of the movie. Some minor plot holes but thats it. it's a solid 9.5 movie. An epic journey. With more than 20+ characters Russo brothers managed to an amazing movie with that many caharacters. This is literrally the hardest movie ever in cinema history. And they succeeded amazingly. Which Zack Snyder/DC couldnt do with that terrible movie Batman V Superman. Only 2 or 3 main characters. Pathetic. Stop giving bad reviews because of humor you cant understand. infinity War is a masterpiece.\n\nActing = Perfect 10/10 Soundtrack = Perfect 10/10 Cgi/Visuals = Perfect 10/10 (Thanos' Cgi is unique, There is no other cgi as good as it) Story = Almost perfect 9.8/10",

Clever, exciting addition to the Marvel saga In My Humble Opinion!",

        "It's beyond my expectation. Some emotional climax comes from villains. It's sad to watch the film. It reminds me of the ghost story of the saint fighter I chased when I was a child. When one gold saint fighter died.",
        "This movie has been worked towards for 10 years. Many, were afraid that it would not live up to expectations. However, I am proud to say that it exceeded every expectation. This movie is brilliant. The acting, the storyline, it all came it all came together in a MARVELous movie. What makes this movie so good is that it surprises. It breaks away from the traditional superhero ways. All in all, it's tremendous",
        "The hero's are outmatched and the arrival of Thanos lives up to all the hype. 2nd best film of the MCU.",
        "I would love to give this a 9.9 star rating! The only reason I took the 0.1 star off is because I hate that it just left me hanging!! It is torture! Can't wait to see what happens next. If you love Guardians of the Galaxy and the Thor movies, which are the only movies I am familiar with, you are going to have enough knowledge to love this. I don't know anything about Iron Man, Captain America, Dr Strange or Black Panther and I still loved this. Check it out.",
        "I can't understand why you guys liked this movie, it's just superhero turmoil. Just can be watch to waste spare time. I must admit that movie's graphics are awesome but movie isn't made up just with graphics.",
        "If you're not a marvel fan, you will probably not like this movie because this movie has no character development. The director expect you to watch marvel movie before this. I'm a marvel fan, so I'm gonna say this movie is fun.",
        "A purple bad guy with a power glove. 2 billion dollars? Really?",
        "No plot, lots of bangs, confusing, full of cliches. What else can I say?",
        "If anyone rate this movie less than an 8, probably never rated a movie above an 8 in their life. For those who rated 3 and below, probably never even seen the move yet or they watched a bootleg copy.\n\nThis movie is a 10 all the way across the board. From the beginning to the end, this movie captures the moment, while seizing the day. I'm already considering going to see it again.",
        "This movie was GARBAGE from the beginning till the end. Too much super heroes. Too much CGI. Zero plot. Everybody sucked in this mess. The Hulk just got on my nerves and i love the guy. Avoid this if you can. It\u00b4s just an empty shell. Awful movie.Pure GARBAGE.",
        "Despite my contribution to the box office of this movie, I still can't believe it can actually rank 60 on the TOP250 list. Perhaps not all superhero movies end in the same way, this big villain finally won. Well, in fact, I think Thanos is very environmentally friendly. You think about it, because there are too many people, resources are limited, and the distribution is uneven, so he considers erasing part of the population randomly to achieve an even distribution of resources. The destruction of Tynos is random, you know, he is so equal hahaha",
        "Two and a half hours and what do you get? Nothing!\n\nThis film is merely an exercise in CGI, lots of fighting, no actual story and finally turns to dust. I shake my head in shame and can't believe what I saw. Perhaps I was half asleep of boredom and can't relate the story.\n\nIt was definitely a spectacle, but honestly, just a spectacle of nothingness. I must stop wasting my time and don't bother about the follow-up to come. Marvel is no longer marvelous.",
        "Everyone's all suited up, but no-one seems particularly excited about it. (Unlike \"I had it in my hands, Marcus!\" or \"You're sorry! ... Abner was sorry for dragging me all over the world for his bits of junk! ... Everybody's sorry!\")\n\n\"What's up, I'm in costume.\" \"Not much.\" \"Meh.\" \"Geez.\"\n\n(And, as Janna Levin points out in \"How the Universe Got Its Spots\" - the universe probably isn't \"infinite,\" but just \"really big,\" anyway!)\n\nDisappointment.",
        "Over the years, we have watched so many hero movies from Marvel. Slowly.....they become dull . I'm bored after watching this movie. Also, I'm a little upset and angry at the same time. Too splendid....too much going on and the ending is ummmm ok. Some characters I do love are Iron Man and Spiderman. Now.......Let's get slamed by the Marvel's fans. No offense!",
        "Infinity war was something that The MCU has been building up to for 10 years now!! Trust me when I say it wasn't a let down, This third installment in the Avengers Series Is absolutely incredible, Now like every movie it wasn't a flawless film, with 1 or 2 dragged scenes, and Some huge Plot holes! But besides all that The film was Amazing and cant wait till it hits Blu Ray so I can watch it over and over!!!",
        "...it delivers.\n\nBoy, does it deliver!\n\nI'll see it several times with different people in Belfast, and will grab it in 3D IMAX in London also. It's worth it.",
        "Brace for noble self sacrifice, senseless tragedy and straight up murder. The good news: really funny. It would be hard for any film to live up the level of sky high hype that has resulted and to satisfy us of every single one of these characters. This film deliver shock after shock. I dont know how to feel about the ending but the award for the most infinite cliffhanger of 2018 goes to this film. Overall well done!",
        "Miss the movie miss the heroes miss the time i watched the movie",
        "What do you get when you bring together over 20 of the most talented actors of all time to team up in an effort to save the planet from extinction? Infinity War.... I was blown away by the emotion I felt throughout this movie and I just didn't want it to end. I'm a huge fan of the MCU and before seeing Infinity Wars I watched all of the other Marvel movies in sequence to prepare myself for this masterpiece... let's just say that I was not disappointed by any means. Josh Brolin did an awesome job playing Thanos. I will most likely see this film 3 or 4 more times in theaters before owning it on DVD and Digital. Don't even pay attention to Anyone who rated this movie low (1 thru 5), these people don't have an understanding or the MCU and therefore cannot fully grasp all that this movie masterpiece really offered.",
        "Lots of spectacle, clever banter & special effects. Lousy ending. It's really just a trailer for the sequel. I wasted my money.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is Marvel's best film to date, balancing humour, action and emotion surprisingly effectively. It's also surprisingly well paced allowing all of it's incredible cast to have at least one memorable moment. The direction from Joe and Anthony Russo is incredible. The music by Alan Silvestri is incredible. The CG and action is phenomenal and undoubtedly some of Marvel's best. Surprisingly, Thanos has a really good amount of depth and Josh Brolin gives an incredible performance. All the Avengers are great but Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Hemsworth give the standout performances. The script is amazing, both bold and unpredictable.",
        "I was so excited before watch the movie. After watched the movie, I was freezed, couldn't think of anything else. The best movie I ever watched. I laughed, cried and so much involved. I have never enjoyed any movie like this much. It us must watch film but please at least understand what is going on in previous film before you go to movie, you will definitely love this movie. Please dont miss this awesome experience",
        "I think this is true for all the superhero movies, they are degrading with time. And definitely getting worse and worse as you watch them again. I found so many things that just don't make sense, that I keep lowering my rating. For example I don't get why Thanos fights after he gets the reality stone. He would have needed to give a heavenly reality to all of his opponents, then he could kill whomever he wanted without any fights. And no survivor would have any problems with it, since they wouldn't know :DDD. My list of such things like this is already too long, so I'm not gloing to watch it again, othertwise, it would get just one star.",
        "This is the worse film to date for marvel, too many plot holes, it was sold as an avengers movie should have just been infinity war, said every character was in it that was a lie, and was very much the same plot as the title that I have sub lined it.",
        "The final 30 minutes make this an absolutely stunning film. These minutes were fast paced, visually astonishing and extremely well and unpredictably written. Still in the beginning there was some awkward humor and also some pacing issues. But I will say it is in the top 5 MARVEL films.",
        "I keep on repeating the movie over and over again. The movie will leave you in happy mood and emotional as well",
        "After the premiere of the first Avengers movie in 2012, it is threatening its presence in the Marvel Universe.\n\nHe appeared with all his power from the beginning of the movie, not disappointed.\n\nExcellent movie, the best of Marvel from my point of view.",
        "Who wants to go to a movie when they feel worse at the end than they do when they come in? The ending ruins the film and tries to hook you into seeing part 2. I will wait until it makes it to the small screen. I won't lay down good money to feel bad. Nice effects but storyline just sucks. I can't believe all the high ratings.",
        "I cant understand how any movie fan in world can give this movie 1 in score?i think people that do that should be banned from scoring movies.its a well made and a very good super hero movie",
        "Jokes are not very great, too many jokes in the middle of fight ruins the seriousness of the situation. The only things thats good in the movie is Thanos. Not heroes, death of Black Order looks so cheap. Just a another movies for target on general audience and millennials. Plus with a lot of plot holes",
        "I have never felt so emotionally exhausted after watching a Marvel movie, but Avengers: Infinity War had me experiencing all sorts of emotions. Sadness, hope, despair.\n\nEveryone left the cinema, spellbound, each reaching for the phone to find out if there was an explanation for anything that happens to the movie characters, and most importantly what the ending means.",
        "Just dragged on and on.\n\nLol, there is no story. Just BS CGI. Only positive is, it's better than end game.\n\nMarvel should just retire and get out of film making.",
        "I think they tried to do way too much. There's so much going on in this movie with all these different characters and it's just absolutely ridiculous. They should've stopped while they were ahead. This is just stupid!",
        "Without a doubt the most complete cinematic experience I've had since The Dark Knight in 2008, only on a much grander scale. A phenomenal acheivement by everyone involved.",
        "....he will win 100% Oscar for the worst scenario and for the worst director",
        "5/5/18. If there could ever be a \"final\" super-hero movie to end all such movies, then this would have been the one. But we all know that that isn't going to ever happen. The MCU is just too lucrative to ever end, especially when these movies continue to rake in millions. The body count is enormous, but keep in mind no blood was spilled, just dust blowing in the wind, and I didn't see any tears shed because it just isn't so - they will all rise again! Worth catching..",
        "Since I'm one of the last people, it seems, to see this movie, I'll keep it short and sweet. One of the most incredible science fiction/superhero movies ever. Action and special effects are on full tilt.",
        "It was the best Marvel movie. It was nice that Marvel Studios decided to bring all the superheroes introduced yet to face the biggest and baddest villian, Thanks. Great action and a great story. The ending was the best one leaving all the viewers in alot of suspense.",
        "Loved it . Worth waiting ten years for .\n\nCan't wait for part 2",
        "Two amazing Marvel super hero movies with a couple moths of each other. But which is better ? thankfully you dont have to chose.\n\nWhat can you say about this without spoiling the movie ?\n\nIts 2 hrs 40 minutes long, but every minute of it is engrossing. So much action, but done in such a manner that you dont get bored with it.\n\nDC have a long way to go to get to this level.",
        "I want to say I loved it but I just can't.\n\nToo long, too many characters and the plot is just a lot like the other movies from the MCU: predictable.\n\nThe actors were amazing, though.",
        "Honestly what can I say? Marvel continues to nail each and every movie one after another leaving us fans speechless. This movie is Marvel at its bloody best! The most interesting thing about this movie is that everyone has a balanced role unlike some movies where one superhero dominates while the others have a blink & miss role. All the characters manage to make themselves visible and noticed and the movie was very well organized! Hats off to the director duo.",
        "Like every superhero movie, you get into it, at the first second. It is also oversaturated of action scenes without any sense. Is not a bad movie, but not even close to be the best.",
        "Excellent!! Marvel and the Russo Brothers have out done themselves! Can't wait for the follow up next year. Best in the MCU to date!",
        "Sad and depressing movie, made my day ruined, I really don't know why people were so hyped for this lol",
        "I'll tell nothing! The Marvel Policy says \u00ab No Spoiler \u00bb!",
        "Only Marvel can do something like this. Making an uncomplete movie but still have overhype fans. You follow a story about how Thanox achieve the infinity stone. There is only 2 things that matters in the movie. Doctor Strange plan and The snap. All the superhero screentime is so useless. You can basically watch the snap and doctor strange scene and you dont miss a thing. Better make all superhero just sit on a cafe and wait for thanos to complete his thing.",
        "Avengers Infinity War was way too long. Endless fight scenes, nonexistent plot, cheap deaths. The 8.9 rating proves that IMDb is irrelevant when it comes to rating the quality of movies. This was so disappointing.",
        "If you are a Marvel fan then you've probably already watched this movie and really enjoyed it. I thought that there was more of a story than a lot of the other Marvel movies and the special effects were very well done. But... I am not really into the whole lore of the Marvel universe and for me it was a bit of a so-so movie. Eye candy and fight scenes really only hold me for so long when watching a movie.",
        "This was the movie we were expecting for a long long time and while Thanos is the best Marvel villain i got a feeling the movie was a little crowded with all the main characters. Sure, they do need to include everyone but on the other hand we never see them all together and the movies gives a vibe of being rushed around from one place to the other and you constantly need to be focused on what is going on. I love all the characters and actors are amazing performers and the story has got to be dark i do think it was a bit too dark since it does not have one positive moment and the Avengers team gets defeated on and on. Of course there is a sequel coming out but i do think a few positive moments would have been good. I loved all the performances and cgi is amazing so overall a positive experience.",
        "This movie has got to be the most overhyped movie in history. To be in the top 75 highest rated films of all time on IMDB just isn't right. This has nothing special to offer, no good entertainment (except for just action and fight scenes if you think that makes a movie good.), the story is unoriginal and boring, the characters are completely stupid and brain dead, it has nothing good to offer. This is serious garbage, the only good part about it was the end of the Avengers ending in their death, but oh no hollywood can't do that, they need money, and where do they get that?? MORE MARVEL MOVIES, so then comes in end game \"the heroic comeback of the heroes.\". This movie is very bad, do not waste nearly 3 hours of your life watching this.",
        "I really hoped to give this a 10 or 9 but keeping it real here...loved how the Marvel movies keep all the actors/characters together to pull off these Avenger movies. Very good job of pulling the plots of all the individual movie plots together. I think IF you haven't seen all the other movies than you may get lost and/or have less positive reviews. Went to first weekend showing and was not disappointed even with the few miscues listed by others here as spoilers.\n\nDefinitely see the strategy for a Part Two which is coming next year. Hopefully, the storyline will start reflecting the comic book storyline soon or these movies will start to lose us...",
        "10 years of Marvel movies leading up to this-most of them very good. I've read the comics, so I knew what to expect, though I don't recall Guardians of the Galaxy characters in the original story. A lot of great action and surprisingly a lot of comedy still too! Spiderman had the best lines! A very good villain and overall super fun, yet darker movie. Not quite DC level dark, but emotionally I suppose. I did feel close to tears at one point actually, but it's because I've grown very attached to these characters. Of course it ended with a big cliff hanger to be continued next year, but I knew that going in.",
        "I am not the most ardent proponent of the Infinity Gauntlet miniseries (I prefer The Life and Death of Captain Marvel, Thanos Quest and Warlock by the same Jim Starlin), but this has nothing of it. An industrially-made crapfest akin to MacDonald Hamburgers with bored-to-death actors easily repleceable with robots from a car factory. Avoid.",
        "Paying off a decade's worth of narrative & world-building with an action spectacle of epic proportions, Avengers: Infinity War rewards our 10-years investment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with an enjoyable, entertaining & exhilarating extravaganza that manages to live up to its enormous hype for the most part, if not all, and signs off by setting up a perfect stage for the grand finale.",
        "Dare I say Thanos has beaten out The Joker for best villain in a \"comic book\" movie; He is unapologetically ruthless. From the very beginning to end, I was on the edge of my seat. Marvel truly did not hold back with this gem*no pun intended* This is a must see! I just don't know how you can top it!",
        "Thanos represents balance in the universe. He wants depopulation and living in harmony with nature and resources.\n\nOn earth today I am that person. I want the population decreased to 1.5 billion from the nearly 8 billion we are at. I already know how to accomplish this with vaccinations and sheer will.\n\nWhat I didn't like and don't like is the use of females being over powered to try and prove they can do what the toughest men do. In life - they can't and that's a fact. And the stupid wakanda whatever with all those useless black tribes who in real life were wiped out because they were to primitive and dumb. There history is one of massive failure and yet today we try to rewrite this to please those who are failures.",
        "The 10/10's just go to show how shallow general audiences have become!! Far from a masterpiece... lots of camera shaking, too many characters, sensational garbage. Jam packing every single marvel hero into 1 film and an ending that is far from 'deep' and just forces you to watch the next installment to make sense of it.\n\n3 stars and that's generous!",
        "I rented this movie after hearing so many good things about it from the Marvel fans. It took me a few months, but I finally got it. Lots of action and plenty of thrills. Plus those twists (I'll let you see the movie for yourself). And all the Avengers battling a common foe together. I'm hoping to see Avengers 4 next summer. Of all the Avengers films so far, this is my favorite. It's basically The Empire Strikes Back of the Marvel films.\n\nPS: Stay after the credits to see a scene!",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is the BEST Marvel movie of all time. ( My opinion, don't hate me ) The cgi was remarkable , the screen writing was INPECKABLE , the acting was amazing and the list goes on. But tbh I SPOILER WARNING I Thanos at some points doesn't seem like a bad guy , sure he wants to kill half the universe and succeeded. But he wanted to kill the bad half ( Don't ask me why Tom Holland, Chris Pat and Chadwick Boseman were killed) But he wanted to live in peace. But if you saw in the end credits that Nick Fury sends a message to Captain Marvel (Also getting her a stand alone film) meaning that Captain Marvel might be the super weapon. And if you read this far than I got treat for you. I looked online for Avengers 4 and saw the cast and I can tell you that The Black Panther will come back. Don't believe me? Link to full cast list. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/fullcredits Trust Me Tom Holland will return. Marvel can't kill Spiderman. But who knows",
        "This movie is perhaps the most anticipated movie of the year, maybe even of all time. So naturally, I went in the theater with really high expectations. With that, comes the fear that the movie won't live up to its hype. However, Infinity War manages to keep me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. With recent Marvel installments being rather stale, the addition of the Russo brothers really took Marvel in the right direction. For the first time, you can really feel the struggles and despair from our favorite heroes. The overall theme and tone are more mature than ever before. Great move from Marvel to keep audiences engaged. Infinity War is, in my opinion, the best marvel movie up to date.",
        "I think that since the original marvel movies (Iron-man, Thor, captain America,..), the movies have become more meaningful over the past years. I really liked the new spider man and black panther, and absolutely loved Thor Ragnarok. I thought civil war was the worst movie in the franchise and it gave me a lower expectation for upcoming avengers films (yes it was technically a captain America film, but I mean it really wasn't was it..), but this movie was so well written with some emotional moments, I'd totally recommend it to people who enjoy a long, breathtaking but also overwhelming movie. 9/10",
        "One of my best experience in a cinema! A lot of action, great characters, my favorite superheroes movie. I loved Dr.Strange and Iron Man interaction, the guardians of the galaxy are always funny and Captain America was great. Thanos was the best part of the movie, THE villain of the MCU.",
        "Infinity war is an overcrowded blockbuster that does not disappoint. While Josh Brolin delivers a performance of a lifetime as thanos. Putting the mcu in its most toughest spot yet.",
        "Freaking amazing!!! I still can't gasp what I just saw...it was effectively moving & superbly action-packed that comes with a jaw dropping ending which may going to disappoint some moviegoers but I'm sure it'd really make sense to the true comicbook fans. Kudos to the MCU team for making it so bold & masterfully crafted. Some may find lack of concentration or character development for some of their favorite characters but as a whole it didn't bother me much, cause you can't expect each & every character of MCU to shine in their own way of glory in one single movie. Moreover, there's the sequel coming next year and that's where many possibilities lies, even changing the course of its reality! Btw, THANOS RULES!!! Awesome character building & surely going to be one of the best superhero movie villains of all time.",
        "Ironman is still the best for me. But the interaction between all the characters is just fun. Just awesome. I love it. Mabye my favorite Marvel ever. Can't wait to see Part 2.",
        "I am going to say straight away I am not a die hard Marval fan as it all seems a touch far fetched for me, but having said I did enjoy the last avengers film and most recent Spiderman. However this, although not a terrible watch was as if they had given the film makers unlimited access to budget and special effects. And the result was as if every instrument in an orchestra was all playing very loudly and all at the same time. Parts felt like I was just watching a computer game and the cgi, and there was a lot of it didn't feel as good as in others. That being said there were more funny parts in this film compared to the others, but was I left thinking about it the next day? No. Would I watch it again? Not unless somebody else asked/forced me to. So overall 6 but more like a high end 5/10 than a solid 6 and I was glad my ticket price was reduced due to an offer.",
        "What can I say? Not the best Marvel movie and not the worst, not by a long shot. One thing for sure, this is a heck of a ride. Awesome action, awesome payoffs. I had to watch it twice. The second time I watched it, I wish I had a remote control for the Vision and Scarlet Witch moments - as well as anything to do with the green skin chick who makes you yawn whenever she opens her mouth. But yeah, take all that cr@p out and you are golden. Still a fun ride.",
        "Wow. I left Avengers: Infinity War SHOOK. The Russo Brothers did it, it's probably one of the best Marvel Movies. Avengers: Infinity War is one of the few movies that made me wanting to see it TWICE. The tone of the movie is very dark, it's an intense movie and deserves to be seen in IMAX 3D, the format I saw it in. This movie blew me away, the music is epic and gorgeous, the CGI is fantastic, Josh Brolin is also fantastic as Thanos, he is very evil but also has something behind him. It's a great movie, I highly recommend it.",
        "Studios making bad content in order to appeal to the masses and shareholders is like fracking - you get the best return right now but you wreck the earth. It's ruining the viewing habits of the American population and then ultimately the rest of the world.\n\n~Jodie Foster",
        "Antother Marvel flick and a bad one indeed. CGI is very good. Standard these days but the rest....simply unwatchable. Completely insane story like so many other movies....",
        "Avengers Infinity War is the definition of mania. Everything just finally unravels on screen and it certainly messes with your mentality if you've been sticking around with this franchise for the past ten years. I'm more than pleased with this exhilarating MCU flick. (Verdict: A-)",
        "Seeing Infinity War was one of the most interesting and most enjoyable experiences a person can have true they probably might have pulled a RWBY(a Rooster Teeth show which I do recommend) after ten years of marvel movies this pulls all increases into a big bowl of fun .after seeing this movie there were kids and probably adults crying a little bit.but I know that this is a part 1 of 2 so I felt hope that all heroes will come back in the sequel. And no I'm just a comic book reader/video gamer who likes action and for those people, who Don't get the story see all the Marvel movies to understand the plot.",
        "One of the films that finishes with villain's win. Overall, very interesting.",
        "I really did try, but I just couldn't make myself care. The whole film is just one big loud flashy CGI scene after another, with no time to actually feel for the characters. They also managed to make Thanos less visually scary than in the other movies? (To quote my sister: \"He looks like a big purple thumb\".)",
        "I love this movie. I'm basically blown away for the entire runtime, even on the fifth viewing. Action packed and epic. The perfect amount of funny. Filled with beautiful shots. An awesome story with a beastly villain who you begrudgingly sympathize with. I can't believe how many characters were in this movie, as well as the mammoth of a cast that comes with it. So many memorable scenes, and when i say memorable, i mean i remember the exact moment i first witnessed them. The music frequently gives it a Shakespearean tragedy vibe. Well done on all counts (6 viewings, 4/26/2018, 5/11/2020, 7/6/2021)",
        "Unless you're a huge fan of this genre of movie, or of the Avengers, I'd strongly recommend skipping this movie. A friend and I went to see it, and left the theater half way through because we were so bored. Although the special effects are good, there really isn't any plot to speak of. For comparison, Black Panther was a much better movie.",
        "My rating is weak 8/10 but I almost gave it 1 because it is so overrated and sooo overhyped. I think the movie is very enjoyable and very funny at sometimes but it has problems and its not perfect.\n\nI really dont like what they did with the Captain America. He was there just to show off with his beard. And I like that the Thor is most powerful but I dont like that he didnt use powers untill he got stormbreaker. Star-Lord is in my top 10 heroes and they just ruined him in this movie. Movie has some plot holes that im not gonna mention. And all deaths after the snap felt forced. Fanboys are saying it is best superhero movie ever. I mean, its not even best mcu film I think Civil War, GOTG and Iron Man are better movies.\n\nOverall as I said very enjoyable and funny but I still dont think it deserves 8.5...",
        "SPOILER: I have tried to write this review 3 times unfortunately every time there is a problem!!!!! So instead of an in depth review all I can say is this is just not funny and the story line incorporating so many characters (heroes) is confusing and just pants particularly when 50%of said heroes die... all good for a sequel but crap story guys. Seriously unfunny unlike Deadpool 2 which was awesome. To conclude unless you are going to do a lot better than this storyline don't bother with the sequel because no one will be interested..",
        "Comedy, sadness, strength, vulnerability - this film has all and more. It could have been twice as long but still kept the viewer in its grasp. I hope tempus fugit as we await the next installment!",
        "...if only whoever wrote the script had a better sense of humor. Speaking of which, it is perfectly okay if the humor is a little much as long as it carries a certain wit about it, instead of sounding forced and cosmetic and just downright tasteless.\n\nI will not say anything good about the film because personally, the humor made me cringe and it took most of the fun away.",
        "I was very pleased with this movie. It seemed to be a none stop thrill ride and leaves me wondering what is going to happen after watching the showings following the credits.",
        "I left about half way through the movie. Lots of stabbing and banging sounds. If that is your thing you will like it otherwise a lot of mediocre animated action with little substance.",
        "I am a big Marvel fan and I've been waiting 3 years for it. Once the movie began I didn't want the end. It has everything- action, romantic scenes, sad and happy scenes, scenes, where you want to cry out loud, but also- it is funny sometimes. The main villain Thanos is not just some kind of villain- he explains why he do what he do and it is quite interesting and soon it will be reality, I think. I went to see this movie twice, because there's so much things happening at once, that I just needed to see it again. I don't regret it. It is so heartbreaking, mind blowing and you will want to see the Avengers 4 right now. I don't know, what to do the whole year. And worse- what am I gonna do after Avengers 4? I can say, that it was the best movie I have ever seen. Thank you Marvel for those happy moments in my life. Can't wait till' next year!",
        "Yes, it is one of the best superheroe movies till this day. Yes, it is one of the most spectacular ones. But I think there are still some flaws like the \"mini boses\" which have a minimal screen time.",
        "You will cry, you will laugh, you will screem with joy, and at the end you will remember this movie for a long time.",
        "This movie keeps you on your toes the whole time and is a very emotional roller coaster. loved it.",
        "From around 50 movies of 2018 this is the movie that made me agry watching. Probably because Ive seen Seven Samurai, Lord of the Rings, Mad Max etc and I cant agree that the level of action movies should fall in this level. From start to finish cgi was the only good aspect of this movies. Those who like it are probably teens. There was a critic who said this movie puts the Hollywood in danger and he is right. Critics gave this an average of 6.8 in Metascore, though it doesnt even deserve that.",
        "10 years and 19 movies led to this. A decade of classcis planting the seeds for this masterpiece. Greatest movie ever made. Period",
        "Gave it a 5 star rating but the meme has died so it's time for my true rating. Perfectly balanced. as all things should be. in all honesty its a great movie 9.5/10.",
        "To cut to the chase without spoilers. This movie is a drama and i advice everyone who want to see this movie to do it, but not now. You HAVE to wait for the next part of the movie and before that appears go and watch them both. I\u00b4m a very big fan of superheroes and went and saw every movie fom Marvel and DC but this movie only disappoints. I have the expectation to walk out of the theater and be glad with a good taste in my mouth but after seeng this movie i only went out angry with a very bad feeling in my belly. That\u00b4s not the point. I realy don\u00b4t understand why they did it in such a manner when they could have done it 100 times better.",
        "This movie I believe was the best part of the Avengers series. Great story, brilliantly portrayed, dialogues on point and the emotionally attachment with the audience",
        "The more you watch it the better it gets. A masterpiece. Action everywhere If that's your sort of thing and everything hits all the right notes. Only thing is you got to have background info on the characters.",
        "There is nothing but flashy images and superficial dialogues. Having a score of 8,5 is just an insult to the art that it filmography. Scorcese was right, this is not cinema.",
        "Dear Users, In my experience of last fifty years - this is the worst movie. It has no consistent plot - no direction - no editing and most importantly no morale. You will be feeling thoroughly cheated while watching this movie.",
        "This movie made the good cast look stupid and no common sense. Made the bad or evil cast dominating from start to finish. I vote for nonsense movie of the millennium!!!!",
        "Crikey, this film went on for ever thus making it a tad dull. Something is happening on planet a, meanwhile on planet b one team are getting ready to go to planet c, once on planet c, the baddie lands on planet d, team 1 then head off to planet e, while team 2 regroup on planet f and so on. At 2 hours 20, this was about 50 minutes too long. It was an ok film but it was also quite bland. 5.5/10 for me.",
        "Watching all of my favourites coming together on the big screen is exciting as hell. Everytime I saw another hero link up with another I was giggling like a kid. Seriously good movie and time travels way to slowly waiting for these movies to come to fruition, where's Dr Strange when you need him?",
        "Marvel have embarked on a massive project to link up many movies over a decade to a grand finale featuring all of the main heroic characters of the movies. However, the inifinity stones are more of a thread linking the movies than a story in itself. The story of the stones is what infinity wars is about. So it's a new story but populated with characters already developed so the character development is that of Thanos, the villain. Josh Brolin is brilliant as Thanos but his back story is a biit lame, perhaps as a result of distillation from the comics, but still for a movie of this scale a bit thin. All of the Marvel characters are involved and it is just too much for the film, giving it an air of contrivance, Comic relief is probvided largely by the Guardians of the Galaxy even that is not so fresh anymore. On the whole it is enjoyable family fluff but falls in many respects due to ridiculous levels of suspension of disbelief.",
        "Watched it at least 6 times now. Its sooo good. Just job well done",
        "I've grown up with these films. I've grown to love them, I've grown to love the characters. This film delivers. No joke, I'm still sobbing after the ending. This deeply and emotionally affected me. I can't imagine what a feat this must be for the Russo brothers, but I salute to them. This movie is borderline perfect in my eyes. DCEU is over. Pack up your bags DC. Thank you Marvel.",
        "Too much emphasis on realistic violence, whereas the ending was a total obvious bang to wait for the next movie. The story plot was lousy, Might as well turn off your brain while watching.",
        "This was one of the most - maybe THE most - disappointing movies of my life. The worst part isn't even the movie itself, it's that it killed almost every other marvel movie I used to love. I can't even go back and watch the old, good MCU movies having seen the craphole where they all lead. I'm swearing off Marvel, swearing off Disney except for the kids' movies, and trying to figure out how to get the theater to not send the money from my ticket to the studio. I don't care if I actually get the money back, I just don't want it to go to the studio for making that train wreck.",
        "I've seen bad movies before, but I have not felt fooled while leaving the theater before.\n\nI did have doubts whether it would still be possible to make an interesting Marvel movie since the theme has been \"rather\" popular. But some of the Marvel flicks were actually really great. So I was ready to believe the reviews, maybe this one would be good as well.\n\nOh boy was I fooled: Non-existing plot and acting, endless, massive, boring battles with lame weapons and superpowers, each more ridiculous than the previous. Absolutely terrible. I have never felt this angry after watching a movie. This was the last time I trust IMDB for anything.",
        "This movie is a masterpiece, what makes this movie great is balance. Russo brothers did a great job featuring Thanos , all while giving proper shine to each character. This movie has no comparison. Never been a Marvel movie of its kind. After 10 years featuring the villain was a genius idea.",
        "When you watch it gives feeling to have Reaction for every part you see it , you want to shout and clap but I couldn't get the end one hundred percent but I think in the infinity war II it will be more clear",
        "I have always wanted superhero films to go beyond the usual tactics of heroes saving the world (and not just the USA) and make a little sense while at it, which is exactly what Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War manages to do, albeit with some sudden melodrama. TN.",
        "Nothing made sense in this marvel movie. When back in the day people used to make fun of superhero movies for their vapid storylines and characters, i actually found ironman to have a very good character development and even the 1st avengers to be entertaining and most MCU movies to have a logical flow. This movie made no sense and was just 3 hours worth of deus ex machina. This IS ther superhero movie people used to complain about. How did it possible get an almost 9 star rating?!?!?! wtf!?!?! i've nvr reviewed a movie before but i had to this time, it was the ultimate disappointment.",
        "Some people say that the pace is so good that you can't breathe...you can't breathe because even the film can't. It's ultra over-populated, you don't know where to look, you don't know where to invest your time, your feelings. And then those cheap one-lines in the middle of the action...\n\nI like some of the action, I liked to see so many big actors, the CGI is great (and too much also), but...even if I really like some of the solo MCU films, The Avengers are just messy, no development, just scene after scene binded with some cheap glue, bad editing. One of my favourites characters died and I just didn't care. Everything seems so fake, so plastic. Probably 20 years ago, I would love it, but nowadays this is definitely not for me.",
        "What kind of a superhero movie is a superhero movie if they loose? The directors just clearly wanted people to waste money in watching this piece awful movie so that they can again waste money in the next awful movie to get more money with Captain Marvel and Ant-Man. Why? They could have just introduced them earlier and could have made a could superhero movie. This is no way similar to the comics. For a big comic book like me who wanted to see the infinity gauntlet storyline being adapted in live-action ,this movie just ruined. And not just that why do these people show scenes in the trailer that are never in the movie.",
        "Infinity war is a high-paced masterpiece that combines so many interesting characters in a unique way.\n\nI am truly impressed by the way the directors have brought things together and have built up the culmination for the whole MCU since 2008.\n\nVisuals are phenomenal, funny moments are plenty. Despite the relatively smaller focus on character development, I liked that you can clearly see the motivation for the actions of each side. This brings more depth to the story and brings the viewer on a emontional ride.\n\nInfitiy war is full of twists and suprises, and is never boring. I feel like I can watch it again and again without ever having too much of it.",
        "For those who hasn't watch it yet, I need to do my warning: You will not see anything memorable when you go to the theaters. You will see a movie filmed on green screen from beggining to the end and watch over 60 superheroes jumping planet to planet.\n\nThere is no outstanding acting, no appealing visuals, no impressive dialogues, no idea, no plot, no message, nothing satisfying! You may like DC style dark and serious superhero movies, you may like Marvel kind silly and funny superhero movies but you are going to hate this in both conditions.\n\nDon't be decieved by ratings, I don't know what these people watched to give these reviews but the hype didn't worth it!",
        "I do not rate movies lightly and i have only once given a 10/10 to a movie. This is the only other time a 10/10 is justifiable. Every second of this movie is perfection. There is not a single moment of the movie that is not eventful or action packed. Every character gets their moment to shine and it's perfect. If you're expecting a great movie, you will not be disappointed and i guarantee you'll be surprised how much better it is than your expectation!",
        "We been waiting 10 years for this? So predictable, looks more a comedian movie then a action movie,",
        "No storytelling, just action. I don't understand the last scene.",
        "I want to give an expanded review but I'm in shocked. I don't even know what to say anymore. This was so great, beyond great actually. You better watch it yourself and you'll see.",
        "Hilarious man baby basement dwelling tasteless fools.",
        "This was the movie I've been waiting for in every Avengers film. Lots of heroes fighting lots of villains. It's a little mindless but very fun if you enjoy Marvel.",
        "I guess there isn't really much point in reviewing an Avengers movie, any plot details could be considered spoilers and as a reviewer you have to walk to egg shells so that you don't give anything anything away. That being said I do want to give a strong recommendation to Infinity War for any fans of this franchise, it's funny it's heartfelt and it go's to some unexpected places. Despite a couple of moments when a character says or does something a little out of character for them and some hard to follow moments of action this is a great movie.\n\nAlso Edinburgh looks beautiful in it.",
        "Boring movie, few good bits but not coherent and cohesive. needed more dialogue and conversations. Needed to take its time. Too jam packed. I liked thor and hulk in the thor 3 movie. I liked Ant man 1. I liked Iron man 1,2,3. The good part in infinity war - thor was good. thanos was ok. wong was good. dr strange was good. bruce was good.",
        "I wish Marvel would stop. I'm done with the cartoonish CGI, poor action scenes and weak plots. I was so bored I started skipping scenes to get to the end. Horrible movie.",
        "How in the world thid movie get a rating of 9 imdb. Expected a lot but failed all my expectations. storyline is so flat things are happening too fast with different marvel character popping out in every scene. I think good movie are really scarce these day",
        "Best awesome movie in decades ! Speechless ! Just three magical words \" thank you MARVEL \"",
        "Why does everyone think this movie is so good. I feel asleep",
        "...you probably should avoid movies based on comic books. Fun summer blockbuster...now you got it. Ignore the trolls with the 1/10's and the 10/10's from the fan boys and you are left with a good flick.\n\nFor me the pace was good and it didn't feel overly long. CGI was throughout(as expected) without being the star of the movie. Decent storyline and plot and very well scripted. Amusing in spots...a bit dark in spots.\n\nPlenty of star power in this one and marvel continues the humanizing of heroes that it invented(the humanizing that is) back in the 60's.\n\nShort review, but ultimately it comes down to I recommend the theatre for this one and don't regret spending the cash even a bit.",
        "A trash CGI movie full of super heros with poor story that might be enjoyable for toddlers and kids.\n\nIt's the same as previous ones, don't waste time and money.",
        "This movie was pretty much what I expected it to be. 2 movies squeezed into one or at least a lot cut away. There were too many fast cuts to count and about halfway I was constantly wondering where are we now. A lot of action with (unnecessary)feels parts in between. There were a huge cast but it was handled better than in Captain America Civil War. Humour was mostly ok and too excessive.\n\nI suppose it's not bad. At the very least time flew a lot faster than in some previous Marvel movies.",
        "I went into the theatre almost being prepared to be disappointed. Just because it was part 1 and a lot of times the first part of movies aren't the greatest. But wow! This movie blew me away. Is was really great. There were sad moments, but also comedic relief that didn't make it come across like they were fitting to many genre's in one movie. The end of the movie will shock you and make you realize that marvel movies can still surprise you. They really put a twist on things that you won't expect. So if your iffy about seeing it because you were disappointed in Civil War. Don't be. The abundance of characters did not ruin the movie at all. I highly reccomend WATCH THIS MOVIE.",
        "All I can say that is I'm not satisfied with the movie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I need to watch it again 500 times",
        "The culmination of ten years' worth of work there's little to say about infinity war other than the highest regards, action packed and straight to the point this film brings a great threat and a fantastic villain and was honestly a great watch at the cinema. At times tear jerking but mostly heart pounding and thrilling this is a landmark in cinema I can't speak anymore highly of it",
        "Trolls sayin this is a bad movie and don't deserve this 8.9 rate. Sorry guys but I have to say it is the best superhero movie ever. The directors made no mistakes. It is just perfect. And I belive somebody doesn't like superhero movies, it is not for them. It is for the 300k people who voted 10*. Peace",
        "Great cast and Amazing CGI. Story line has too many holes to even summarize. Fight scenes, especially with Thanos, are shockingly unimaginative. Where is the thoughtful use of each hero's superpowers to push Thanos to the brink of defeat? How many times is somebody going to try and hit him on the chin only for it to be shrugged off? C'mon. $300M+ budget needs to go into thoughtful writing like what as done with the depth of Thanos character to make this the masterpiece it should be. All that said. Solid 8 star and great movie. Could have been a real classic and not just a blockbuster.",
        "Good flick with a steady plot and good family fun. Show started with action and kept it interesting all the way.",
        "Maybe it's only me but as time goes by the newest avengers movies seems so boring and worse and worse... I won't say it's that horrible just much less then what I've expected and...\n\nstrill you should propably watch it... you might like it you may not... it's hard to say...",
        "This is a very good film (brilliant in places), with good character time for most, some reasonable humour alongside the violence, but it's bloated - just far, far too long. By the time it wraps you give up caring. And it feels like the MCU is nearing the end with its visibly aging stars.",
        "Seriously! This is an action packed movie that you can enjoy, have fun, be emotionally invested. If you read a critic who making negative comments because the storyline doesn't seem too deep or some other stupid reason, don't listen. If you enjoy superhero mashup movie, this is the ultimate one. Doesn't get bigger than this. Get a popcorn and watch the movie. Most importantly, enjoy!",
        "If lazer tag with hack writers sounds like your idea of a nice Friday evening then good for you. I, a man of taste, prefer to shovel baby feces into my mouth and scream at my dog",
        "What a film. Best marvel Avengers film to date.\n\nEverything about this film was perfect. I don't really have any more to add!",
        "Such an action packed movie. A lot of sadness action and comedy. Greatness.",
        "All Marvel movies look the same, sound the same, feel the same. I thought I was watching Black Panther again. And with 20+ super-heroes there is no time for character development. The first Avengers is still the best, by far...",
        "All throughout these ten years everything has been building up to this movie, and it surely does pay off big time. The action is incredible and the characters are so well used, it gets the plot moving constantly. Thanos is fantastic as the villain, and certainly the best MCU villain ever. Definitely one of the best superhero films ever made, and a total joy to be able to see it on the big screen.",
        "If not the immortal stupidity of the actions/heroes in films, it would be a great movie(thinking out loud: just a couple of seconds it was necessary to wait, you idiot). And sometimes I felt like relevant in the previous films jokes, here often inserted just to fill the airtime. In all other respects - an excellent film.",
        "I have the feeling that the makers of this film wanted it to be \"The Empire Strikes Back\" of the MCU. Without speaking to any story details, I'll say that from the very opening scene until the final shot of the film (and the post-credits preview scene) it's a \"downer.\"\n\nSo, if you're the type of movie-goer who feels entertained by emotional downers, then you'll enjoy this film. My guess, however, is that most people who go to a Marvel film expect action AND a \"feel good\" at the end. That's not this film.\n\nI'm glad I waited for the Amazon & iTunes RENTAL to come out...this is not a film I want to own, or will watch again.",
        "This is without a doubt the best MCU movie ever made! Yes, even better than Endgame which I feel is a disappointing conclusion. This movie is almost flawless throughout! Nothing seemed out of place or annoying. This one definitely isn't overhyped & deserves the praise it got! 10/10 easily!",
        "After a reading a negative review or two I really don't understand what goes on in people's mind. After watching avengers infinity war, I can't really describe how epic-much this film is not to mention this is just part 1 of the infinity war. This movie gets straight to the point of having to get everyone back together in hopes of putting an end to thanos before worst comes worst. Before reading any comments, see the movie urself and be ur own judge",
        "After 5th time to seeing this movie, Im writing this review. Infinity War is not just a movie. It is a consequence of events in Marvel movies for 10 years. It is a huge responsibility to make a movie like this. Because it has to be a bridge of phase 3 and 4, considering MCU will be continued for years... Also this is a big comic book event and it has lots of characters. Russo Brothers and writers did a brilliant job on it. It is amazingly epic, it has action all the time, it might make you cry few times, it can make you extremely laugh, it makes you thrilled and surprised. Shortly, you feel a lot of emotions during Infinity War. Even if you didnt watch any marvel movie, it can blow your mind too. No doubt, it is absolutely one of the greatest comic book movies in history. Im counting days for Endgame.",
        "I think I can't talk to much about this movie, very perfect. The most best selling movie comics of all time.",
        "The story, the effects, the way it wraps up all the movies, its just genius. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time.",
        "Avengers Infinity War is bigger and better then any other movie.",
        "Infinity war is based on 2 things first thanos & start conclusion of 1st avengers in these movie perfectly time space for all characters",
        "This is the best superhero movie. But not a masterpiece.",
        "I've watched infinity war four times now. Every time i watch it, i like it better than the previous time(s) I've watched it. Truly a masterpiece",
        "Boring, stereotypical, American action film, with too much comedy thrown in. Way too campy. Marvel movies are just horrible.",
        "I was wondering who a sequel like this reaches a IMDB score of 8,6. Starting the film I had great expectations! But I really found NOTHING in this movie that is worth more than 4 stars. This is a senseless digital action trash with no story at all! It\u00b4s just a bunch of knows characters fighting the almighty bad guy ... No new Ideas, not funny, not emotional, just explosions and fist fights with some magic artefact lacking any sense. And the end of it is just -to be continued-. Even that tiny bit of story is not even told to the end. Its a shame that this move stands among great films with a rating of over 8. If you watch it please rate it properly and send it down to where it belongs!",
        "Marvel never disappoints when it comes to production values. \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is no exception. It is beautifully and atmospherically designed, smoothly shot and edited, and the special effects, not overused or abused, are among the most extravagant and impressive for any film seen in recent memory. It is tightly directed, dynamic and rousingly scored.\n\nAll in all, a great movie.",
        "I have a few questions about the film. But yeah, he's awesome. Thanos is really great. He surpassed perhaps (and made according to the pattern) Fisk. Kingpin is great. Undoubtedly, some of the deaths will be reversed in the second part (either Thanos has not lost all the properties of the stone and we will find those killed at the Grandmaster). If we talk about films divided into parts. Infinity War utterly defeated the Deathly Hallows, and Thanos Volodya. The red skull is the best thing in the movie in my opinion)))",
        "This is one of the best marvel movies ever made!! Such a great acting with great adventures .What I am surprised about is that this movie has lots of great famous actors, and actresses! You got people like, Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man Tony Stark, S Johansson as Black Widow, and Chris Evens as Captain America! The superhero characters are super cool, and fun to watch in The Avengers!! The action is strong, and well packed!! The acting is great!! I still enjoy Marvel a lot! It is super fun, and exciting to watch! Chris Hemsworth as Thor is a good choice! He does a great job with that role! But I do give The Avengers a 5/5 stars!! It is a movie that is definitely worth a watch!",
        "Not to mention what the plot of the next movie will be, but for this avengers 3, there is no villain, only justice, no villain, only hero!",
        "I can say that it is the best movie with a bad ending. I got goosebumps every single minute throughout the movie, and I still get goosebumps watching scenes.",
        "After 2 outstanding Avengers movies comes this one. It seems that their only goal was how to make this one so long and without victory for Avangers , so we have to \"wait\" Infinity war part Two. Shame on you Marvel. You spoiled everything you did great with Tony Stark and Hulk.",
        "You know that feeling when you're bursting for the toilet, I mean you have the sweats you're back teeth are floating, you can feel it touching the cloth but your miles from any decent place to go so you hold it and hold it. But then you get home, race to that porcelain prize.\n\nIt sits there like a gift from the gods looking all shiny and white, clean and pristine then you proceed to bomb it like a middle eastern country. You remember that feeling of relief, joy, rapture you might have even commented to yourself it doesn't get any better than this, well that might be true until you see Infinity War, it's that good\n\nNow where's the toilet roll????",
        "It's just not a very good movie. Loud dramatic music while a city is destroyed. Tense standoffs where only one good person fights one bad person at a time. Does this sound like every other Marvel CU movie ever? Yep. Like I said in the title, if you're 12 years old you would probably rate this high. Scar Jo and Falcon are the absolute worst characters. I won't give it a 1 star, but I definitely will not rate it higher than a 3.",
        "The movie was great and they manage to give screen time to almost all the characters, eventhough it is not an easy task. However, I don't understand why marvel use such crappy background music? Infinity war has horrible background score as if you are watching an 80s sci fi movie!",
        "Abysmal and embarrassing cinema. The outcome of dumbing down and treating the audience as morons.",
        "Best marvel movie yet, so much action and sadness at the same time. Can't wait for the 4th avengers",
        "I'll keep it simple, I expected more and got less. All the other Avenger movies were a complete movie. They had a plot, a war, and won. This was not that. This was a part 1. And none of the ads mentioned it was a part 1. My expectations were dashed.\n\nIt was too much and much too inconsistent. Battles that should have been won were not for stupid reasons. I started to cheer and then had this WTF happened?\n\nIt's worth watching, but, well... just but...",
        "Maybe if it wasn't so overrated I'd actually enjoy its CGI. Anyway, it's very monotonous and long, nothing really stands out and a twist in the end is so predictable. It pretends to be serious, but why would even bother? Jokes are so dull they make you cringe.",
        "I've heard Avengers: Infinity War paralleled with Empire Strikes Back - not a bad comparison. Fantastic movie. If it's not the best Marvel has made, its definitely one of them. If you liked the original Avengers movie, this one will blow your mind. It's so great to see everyone together, to have Thor with the Guardians, to watch Iron Man and Spider-Man fight alongside Quill and Doctor Strange. I've seen this twice already, and I'll be seeing this yet again for sure. The wait for Captain Marvel and Avengers 4 is gonna be harder than ever. Times cried: 2",
        "There was balance between explosions and quietness. I was sceptic, I thought I would get empty feeling like what usually I got after watching summer blockbuster movies. This movie is different, I felt lots of emotion afterward :)",
        "I really enjoyed this, I think every Avengers movie goes from strength to strength making it even more gripping to watch, roll on part 2!",
        "Wow!! That movie was really awesome!!! I loved it !!!!",
        "Nice to see a \"villain\" that is not just an evil stereotype.",
        "Went to see this movie yesterday with no expectations and absolutely enjoyed it. First book I read was a comic book in fact. I found myself feeling like a kid multiple times in this movie. It is great entertainment. It has the feel of th comic books. Obviously, this is not a Bergman movie and will not win at Cannes but it does an excellent job at what a blockbuster should do and what it should be.",
        "This movie is seriously bad. The story goes that Thanos wants the gauntlet to snap his fingers. He kills avengers and lots of action oh wow so cool lasers rays guns magic wow so entertaining. It throws a bunch of fighting in and talking thats about it with a story not even that good. Its a bad movie and very overrated only made for troglodytes who only watch movies to see action.",
        "Oh my god. Incredible movie. I enjoyed seeing all the stars in one movie. I expected this movie for so long. The story is great, the cgi is flawless. Thumbs up for Russo Brothers for this incredible directing. Along the movie there are some minor flaws in the story, but in the end is good. The end is heartbreaking. Good job.",
        "Mind-numbing, give me your money for nothing, story what story, guess the number of celeb in... In short - lazy and bad, so so bad...",
        "Looks like Marvel got tired from the stereotype that they never truly kill their characters and they started to swing the sword left and right. The franchize went from no death to a freaking graveyard in one movie. So Marvel tried, but still MESSED UP big time! Peace.",
        "I just came out of the theater watching this movie and it has everything - from humor to drama, action, visuals, concept and characters.\n\nThanos stands out beyond our expectations. As there many characters, this makes them less special. Many characters dies unexpectedly.\n\nI would have to say that it is the best movie from Marvel's Studio. I loved Thano's characters so long after the Joker from The Dark Knight.\n\nLet's see post credit scene gives another movies or not.\n\nAll these years of hard work is paid off. I can't wait for Avengers 4 now.",
        "Wasn't expecting much from this one, but this was actually pretty good! I'm not a fan of Marvel or really just superhero films in general but this was entertaining and even somewhat risky in some aspects.\n\nIt doesn't really do anything exceptional, and there really isn't a protagonist or 3 act structure since this is more of an event rather than a film. For what it is it's good. Not a masterpiece, doesn't deserve that high of rating on this site, but it's solid.",
        "The same movie, a different name. That\u00b4s it. Nothing changes except the color of the cape.... Theme Parks are fun to watch but not seriously. MCU is extremely overrated!!!!",
        "This movie is full of emotions, ups, downs and will make you leave the cinema feeling a mixture of them. Plenty of humour and action.",
        "I was a big fan of Captain America, Winter Soldier and Doctor Strange, but i had enough.",
        "Absolutely Amazing. Lives for the hype. I was surprised to see how serious this movie is compared to other MCU movies. If you're going to see this movie expecting those classics gags and one liners from the other movies this is not it. This movies has complex and emotional carachter arcs and it all comes down in such a perfect tone. 10 years lead up to this. Definitely worth the wait. The only downpoint is that it lacks the cosmic ingredients from the cosmic (if you read the story you know what I mean)",
        "A must watch for all MARVEL Superhero movie buffs, rest if you cannot resist give a try, you may like it. The movie is funny, has a story (does that matter) and carries one of the best Superhero movie villain in the history of movies (probably). He grabs more screen time than most of the SUPERHEROES in the movie. Moreover, Thanos is a villain who also 'cries'. Surprisingly, the story does not end here, i.e, after over 2 hrs. Yes it has a sequel! I would not be surprised if Thanos is made a SUPERHERO. He has the moves, the voice , the power.",
        "There is nothing about this film for anyone above the age of 12.",
        "It puts all of marvels other films to shame. This is truly incredible. I had my reserves because there was going to be so many people in it but it works. I need to see it again in the cinema.",
        "Aw yeah it's pretty good. 10/10. Come on, it's an avengers movie. What more can I say?",
        "So I just got out of cinema. That ending was huge disappointment. Unpredictable yes but disappointing. Even more disappointing- lack of Steve Rogers / Captain America fights. I mean , COME ON, He deserves more than this!!! Thor had the spotlight. I do understand he is god but I like Cap more and I think he deserved another killer fight choreography as in his own movies. This was about the team yes- but I simply like his character the most of all avengers. Thor scene gave me goosebumps I admit. Humor is amazing through all movie. Especially The Guardians. All in all, this movie was entertaining, much better than the first Avengers (which I didn't like) but it's still not perfect. Most characters still look over cartoonised , or simply look like a psp game. The Lord of the rings convinced me long time ago that a fantasy/sci fi movie it doesn't have to look animated. I am not saying it should be 'DC dark' but Marvel must grow up. It's time!! Teenagers will have the most fun of all while watching this, it fits their age in maturity.",
        "I'm fed up with CGI superhero films but this addition is not bad at all. I didn't see the ending coming!",
        "This movie was so good and was a better to be understand.loved the whole story and the character of the thanos was so good i think they did not make him as a just a villain but he has also a feelings about his adopted daughter but movie has some critic that the thanos is considered as a villain but he has also a good emotions for his daughter?? what? he loves his daughter so much but he also sacrifice his daughter?this should be considered as a big critic for this movie.and end was so shocked and curious that every person want ahead of this movie right now.though it was a best and good adventure movie can't say that it ruined the movie,only sensible people will get this kind of movie.",
        "So I'm not going to review infinity war into great detail, since as I'm writing this there's over 850 reviews, in a span of the movie being out for only 3 days, but I will say I'm a huge MARVEL fan. Bigger than you believe. The movie was near perfect. Probably ranked in my top 3 favorite comic book movies of all time. It was an emotional roller coaster, and it made me cry. And that's saying something since Logan didn't even make me cry. The visuals are amazing, The Black Order was amazing, one of the best part of the film. It's also crazy how much character development Thanos had in one film. The Russo brothers actually made me love him. And to conclude my review, I walked into the theater paying 20$ and walked out having to pay 300$ a week. If someone can send me Marvel's address and everything so I can bill them for my therapy sessions that would be great :) one more thing I would like everyone to stand 2 minutes in silence for our fallen cinematic universe; The DCEU, may they rest in peace.",
        "Did not disappoint. What a brilliant start to part one of two. I found my self leaning to team thanos we defo see a side to him finally after 20 movies that have been building up to this. He's not the crazed lunatic he is made out to be he's a realist anyway hope u guys enjoy",
        "It is a well balanced movie. Best Marvel movie in the whole franchise. It has a cohesive plot and flow. Thanos War is an apt title as this movie focuses on the villain more then the 20 or so superheroes enlisted to fight him. You get to see the world from thanos's eyes. A different perspective which is what makes it different and better. If you waited for an epic Thanos movie you have got it.\n\nThanos gets fully fleshed out and his motives and desires become clear. It shows what he is prepared to lose in order to gain his goals. He is the only decent villain to come from marvel and rightfully so as the stakes are never higher. There is plenty of action and it isn't just mindless fighting.\n\nThere are only some flaws but you forget them cause the movie is good.",
        "Didnt like it at all, so much going on, too much actually going on, another open ending, how many of this movies are they gonna make? Might aswell make tv series out of them.",
        "This movie will make you cry, laugh, and smile!! Literally every emotion you have, this movie will make you feel It; it is that good!!",
        "I won't say superhero movies are my favorite genre but I watched most of them as I like easy entertainment sometimes and that's exactely what you get with Marvel and DC Comics charachters movies. In Avengers: Infinity War you get what looks like the end of an era. The ending and explanation of alot of questions from other Marvel movies. You won't get bored with this movie as almost all Marvel characters figure in it. Not only the story is entertaining but the CGI's are like always stunning. They clearly spent a high budget on the CGI's and it shows, it's all quality.",
        "If you are not a fan, don't watch it. I nearly fell asleep at the middle of the film.",
        "OMFG, best superhero movie EVER\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
        "Too dumb for words. I don't buy Andy Dwyer as anything close to a badass. And a tween Spiderman? Explains a lot about the people who rate this high.",
        "This is one of those Movies that you can watch from start to end and not get bored at all! Endgame wasn't even this good. Everything is great from Visuals, Music and Story. I can watch this once A week and never be bored by it. A very rare masterpiece.",
        "I was not amazed by this movie! Black Panther is way more culturally relevant.",
        "SPOILER: The ending was unclear. The death scenes were disappointing to the point of unbelievable. To find out the main characters actually died the way they did with little emphasis would be massively disappointing to all audiences.",
        "The problem with this movie is, it has no heart. It's formula, amped up with effects. A movie designed by committee, hoping fireworks and \"metaverse\" (ugh!) characters will print money. How souless it all is.",
        "Call it a secret recipe for great film making, marvel keeps getting better and better!!",
        "Great movie! Must see. Curius what the next one wil bring. Can't wait.",
        "I was not disappointed!! This movie was a roller coaster of emotions but I loved every single scene. This is a must watch!!!!",
        "Went down the 'event cinema' route. Lots of flying about. Lots of confused fighting. Too many characters. Ludicrous, unjustifiable character actions used to move the film along. They opted against using too much humour this time around too. It felt like a film made by committee of management consultants.",
        "I knew almost all about this movie before I saw it: Superheroes disagree amongst themselves, but must stand together against some CGI villain, This CGI villain is off to destroy a city.... no wait, we've already done that, the World..... no wait, we've done that too, THE UNIVERSE, and the superheroes more less prevail in the end, leaving some sort of cliffhanger though to ensure further profits from the next instalment.\n\nPlease... a little more orginality next time, Marvel?",
        "How to throw all storylines on one big heap, put them through a blender and see what's left. What is the point of this movie? Find out which characters are worth saving for the next installment? What a waste.",
        "It's been about an hour since I saw this movie and I'm still in shock. This movie was absolutely overwhelming from start to finish, and it really brings a strong emotional aspect that we have never seen from Marvel before. No doubt this is in my top 5 movies of all time, and there is no reason why you should not see this movie. But, before you see it, if you are not familliar with the marvel universe, I recommend doing a little bit of research before going.",
        "6/10 - this superhero crossover had too many lead characters to where the story felt like it was all over the place and not really connected",
        "The story is about thanos is collecting infinity stones so he can wipe out half the universe and now the original avengers have to get help from doctor strange, spider man, the guardians of the galaxy and a bunch of others. So let me say something this movie is awsome the special affects are good and characters are good the ending was so surprising.",
        "Rank system i use is it can only be ONE movie that is the best and then get 10, to get a 9 it have to be something extraordinarily like Alien and so, a 5 is a ok movie nothing more nothing less its simple a mainstream movie.\n\nAs i wrote in the topic it was just to much to many super heros and mix off them simple felt to much and the Movie was like 1hour to long.",
        "Best movie i seen so far it is so awesome a lot action it is very funny it has shocking ending it is very heartbreaking it will make you it me cry but i still love it",
        "For me this movie is good because it makes a good example why a eschatology is basically a stupid idea. The plan \"for the end of times\" falls and any two pieces won't fit together, leaving the story in need of a very dynamic part to simply jump from one aspect to another. And in this case, the script does deliver: they have to jump far and to jump often and with enough FX so audience won't stop to think WHY? In a way the audience becomes a junkie saying \"gimme more\".\n\nI was quite disappointed of the end, but thanks to Wikipedia now I know that was actually Part 1, and there is a Part 2, pretty much like the final part in the Harry Potter money machine.",
        "This movie is packing many aspects into its backpack and amazingly it succeeds delivering all of it. How is it possible to fit massive load of heroes on screen? Is the directing and cutting hasty, editing messy?\n\nThe answers are; Very possible and no, there isn't anything wrong with the linearity of plot and scenes.\n\nRusso bros have obviously been workshopping the content for years and it has paid off. Presentation works, no side jumping plot, fitting many top actors with enough dialog to keep everyone on the board with his/her favourite superhero along the ride.\n\nMovie actually is best of superhero movies that have been made till this day.",
        "I'm gonna keep this short because you've heard this everywhere, but Avengers: Infinity War is amazing. Probably my favorite film out of the MCU. With the amount of characters in this film the Russo Brothers had to juggle, it's astonishing this movie worked. Every character felt like they were apart of the movie in a good enough way, there was a perfect balance of screen time. And they managed to write Thanos as one of the best villains EVER. Visual effects are perfect, I mean what else do you want. This movie also had a whole lot of hype around it and it was one of my most hyped movies of all time. Infinity war gets a 10/10",
        "Whether or not you are a fan of the MCU, you have to admit that this film will be a part of cinematic history. The MCU is a massively successful franchise, a franchise that has made more money than any other franchise in history (true, there are more films in this franchise, but that's still an accomplishment). Not all of the films in this franchise are good, but almost all of them are watchable (at least once). This film was really good, but, like I said above, you really have to put in the work if you want to reap the rewards. If you like the MCU, you already know you're going to see this movie anyways, and you're probably willing to forgive it for most of its flaws. This movie is absolutely worth seeing. It won't win any large awards at the Oscars next year, but it's certainly a very well done and extremely entertaining comic book movie; in the end, that's why we came to the theatre.",
        "This was epic. It has claimed my spot of favorite movie of all time. The action was AMAZING, the twists were CRAZY (seriously you don't wanna be spoiled for this). LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!",
        "Doesn't have to be underrated only because it's a unrealistix sci-fi super hero movie for kids (and adults as well). It's a good movie without prejudice. Hail Marvel, rip Stan Lee.",
        "This is everything I wanted it to be and more. Will go down as the greatest cinematic event till next year when we do it all again",
        "The culmination of all that came before. Can't wait for the next one!",
        "A great job at what could have been a big mess. So many characters, such different tones in the worlds of the different heroes, such a big story arc to be told in one movie (Ok, the rest is to be told 26 April 2019, but they covered a lot of ground in this one). Things that caught my attention: great performances by all the cast, real stories interweaving the larger story, not just 3 minute cameos. Laugh out loud lines. A real threat demanding great cost. Spectacular success for the Russos in a Herculean endeavour. Just really well done! On a rewatch, I bump up my rating from 9 (superb) to 10 (I don't know how it could have been better) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Advenure}",
        "Decent comic book movie, but way overrated. This should have been spread out over a few movies instead of Thanos just steamrolling over everyone and everything. Thanos was a way better character in this movie.",
        "The rhythm is a bit bad, especially the garbage of the Galaxy, which is stirred up in the middle of the mess, let's die quickly. In the end, the close-ups of eliminating hegemony are too short to fully show the complexity of picking up everything but getting what you want. This is one of them. How can Hollywood always deal with the third part of the series now?",
        "Love it this is by far the best marvel movie it is just like it made it for me",
        "Thanos was great as villain (his motives, not so much), the action scenes were good, I liked most of the character interactions, there were some emotional scenes that were done well, and a few things will transpire that you won't see coming, which was very exciting. A lot of the humor was contrived; some of those emotional/dramatic scenes were ruined by poorly timed jokes, something that Ragnarok and GotGv2 suffered from immensely. Way too overcrowded with so many heroes and not enough characters development. The plot is good but it's a mess. Doctor strange was a great addition to avengers movie but not with star lord and his crews. Overall it is a forgetable movie as it has absolutley no impact for the MCU. Eveirthing they did in this movie will be undone in the next one, and that is for sure.",
        "An American action thriller; The Avengers assemble for a third time and the result is an astonishing and sensate extravaganza, ambitious in scale, imaginative in backdrops and attractive settings thanks to some wonderful CGI rendering. The movie's biggest accolade should be reserved for the writers who had to satisfy avid followers of the film series by featuring and distilling so many outlandish characters from previous sagas and still make it entertaining. The result was a success - the heroes' egos jam up alongside each other beautifully. Robert Downey Jr is on top form once more, and the Guardians of the Galaxy troop provide welcome comedic relief. Also, Thanos, is the most meaningful and personal antagonist of the series. All in all it is an exciting epic, but with the dizzying array of heroes came a steady succession of overlong fighting sequences which occasionally lack a pulse and will become desensitising for some viewers who will say there's only so many times you can watch someone being kicked and punched through a wall.",
        "This is not one of the best superhero movies for me, probably because I'm not a big fan of putting so many characters from the \"universe\" in one movie, be that dc or marvel. After getting over myself and the fact that spiderman is in space... I watched it for what it was, a fun special effects action movie of good vs evil. It is definately evil they are fighting...\n\nA little long perhaps, but cramming all of the characters in here from avengers, guardians of the galaxy and so on, then it has to be.\n\nIt's a fun ride and worth a watch. Whilst a good stand alone movie, it does set you up for part two, even referring to \"End Game\". So despite its flaws I'll certainly watch Endgame.",
        "Story is scandalous. Too much heroes... you know what I mean. It really hurts during watching.",
        "Infinity War is a wildly ambitious and entertaining ride. For the first 90 minutes it pulls it off. However i was bored in the last 60 minutes.\n\nIt's very funny, and many of the characters are on good form. Thanos is an intimidating villain, cunning and cruel. But like so often with Marvel he does come up short. And blink and you'll miss Black Panther, bar the fantastic Wakanda battle,\n\nEveryone floats away at the end, and it will do likewise in my memory.",
        "Just getting silly. Not really interested anymore. Lost interest after 20 minutes.. Bye bye... Silly verse..",
        "The Marvel Cinematic Universe's newest entry is its biggest, most ambitious piece of storytelling in the studio's 10 years of existence and the minute you exit the theatre, you'll be lining up at the box office to buy another ticket. It's that good. Roaring through 160 minutes of action, humor, character development, epic evil and moving nobility, it is darker and edgier, yet lighter and more stirring than anything offered in another superhero franchise.",
        "Way too smashy-explody for my liking. Also, Thanos is a bumbling idiot.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War getting anything above a 6 ratings destroys my faith in IMDB's rating system. Once I got past the first page of 10/10 ratings, the rest were 1, 2 and a few miscellaneous 5's. Four of us sat down to watch this movie last night and only two of us could finish it. I apologized for renting it and threw IMDB's ratings system under the bus. I kept waiting for something redeeming to happen, but it never did. The countless times I said, \"Well, that was stupid\" went on through the entire movie. Plot holes, lazy writing or whatever you want to call it were just constant. I will not wait through another 2+ hour movie in this series hoping for something redeeming to happen. Oh, and taking the red, white and blue away from Captain Am.., wait, what's his name again? Steve somebody. No, I'm done and whatever gaming of the IMDB ratings went on makes it of less use too.",
        "The result of 10 years of work is wonderful, film with good moments. Comedy at the right time Many sad moments are also present, in my opinion the best film with super heroes",
        "Infinite war is not a bad movie at all, but I feel like people are overrating this movie way to much telling how amazing the acting, story, and scenes were. Maybe it's because I haven't watched all of the previews movie, but to me this was just something to waste some time with, it had some good moments but overall I wouldn't say it deserves to be so high on list.",
        "I'll try not to spoil anything, but let me say that this is by far the best marvel film, if not just the best film, I have ever seen!\n\nThe story was great, the acting was great. You could see everyone's emotions just by looking into their eyes.\n\nI will say, you need to be prepared for some extremely emotional sections, especially the ending.\n\nI'll also say that there is only ONE post credit scene. It comes after the long credits, so be sure to wait through the whole thing!\n\nThis was an AMAZING film. Go see it now!",
        "I rewatch it. The story line converge to Thanos win, this turn the movie quite predictable.\n\nThe holes: Loki could have escaped with Tesseract.\n\nA mole can pass through Wakanda shield .\n\n. .",
        "Highly recommmend watching this film. Lot of fun seeing it with a group of friends. After seeing it at the cinema, it leaves you completely shocked, with plenty of great comedic and dramatic moments scattered throughout. Definitely one of the greatest Marvel films to date.",
        "Why has a O.K marvel film BlackPanther got so much hipe when this film has better special effects and story and blackpanthers performance in it is better. They might be waiting till finnal chapter to give this franchise credit.",
        "I left that cinema shocked and my mind reeling. Avengers Infinity War was executed amazingly. Perfect balance of drama, comedy and action. Congrats to all the cast and people who made this movie! You did us all proud!",
        "To be honest there are many things which you can applause for Being a Marvel & DC Comic book reader i would like to say :-\n\nIn 1 line - \"Be prepared to witnesses this spine chilling story\"",
        "This was one of those rare movies that kept my attention. The scenes where amazing, acting was spot on. Tom Holland was the best thing about this film! I'd get it 11 stars if I could.",
        "This film blew me away with how good the acting and the special effects were well done Marvel, please don't listen to all these idiotic people that gave it terrible reviews they're wrong.",
        "The movie can be described as \"decent\" at its best. The movie fails in its length and use of CGI. I don't think there was a single camera shot that didn't include some kind of CGI. The acting was okay, but the humor was misplaced. It's time for the avenger movies to end.",
        "This movie took me on a ride my shoulder muscles are soar my head hurts and my freakin heart hurts! The ending will destroy any true fan of these films! But they did a fantastic epic job from hiding it from us! My mom was so upset I couldn't believe it! And not gonna lie I cried a few times! Especially the Spider-Man part! Be prepared for this film! It won't go the way you want it too!",
        "Stud 10 S?\n\nMastered invisibility :)\n\nBlanket of Death :)\n\nSometimes you have to just enjoy.\n\nSkeletor!\n\nSwords to Plowshares.\n\nVery interested as to what will happen next.",
        "I'm not a Marvel fan, but the films before I did like because of the humor and nice storyline. But this film started like I missed out on a movie, but I found out I didn't. There's too much going on, it's an overkill on action. Ok, the action is actually very good, but it is way too much. So my tolerance for Marcel ends here. But ok, I will watch the last one. Only to see how it ends...",
        "I have never wrote a review on a movie but this was just absolutely spectacular! Best movie I have seen in a long long time! Definitely a must see!!",
        "The only movie I've seen where the villain really does what he said he would do.",
        "An epic undertaking on a massive scale that definitely pays off - it successfully combines each of the characters (and their franchises) together well, weaving them into a new story which they can all (almost equally) partake in. Visually it is superb with excellent special effects and settings throughout, and there is the right amount of humour spread across the characters. The plot transitions from the different group of heroes well, and manages to balance the story with the action - the slower, emotional scenes often have the same impact as the large scale and explosive actions scenes. However, the same criticisms of the Marvel series of movies are still there - the heroes are thrown about seemingly to no consequence, the plot just trundles along at times with little respite, and some of the fight scenes are so quick so you can't see the action.",
        "It is a great movie and one of the best in the ucm is next to endgame they are my favorites I almost cry in the cinema for this movie and thanos is wonderful",
        "Reviewing this after end game. This movie is hard to beat. They did an excellent job with this MCU film. Thanos was excellently presented.",
        "Excellent visual effects, creative and artistic in 3D. Too many characters in this film with too many subplots. Many of the main superheroes have been stars in their own superhero films. Not much time spent with each one, but there were some entertaining, but brief, performances. Most of the film involved aliens and superheroes being either blown up or shot. Although I felt transported into outer space with the amazing visuals, the story seemed to never end and was predictable up until the ending. I think I saw 1,000 aliens get massacred in total. The ending stunk, a real let down.",
        "It shoudn't end this way (starts crying). However, it was great. Marvel really knows how to entertain.",
        "Lengthy, but worth the watch. Packed with action and humour.",
        "In terms of content, the third part feels rather void for strangers to the genre. Because all in all, compared to the first two parts, there is simply more action, more superheroes and even more aggravation towards the unforeseeable end. But it's great to see the Avengers getting more and more involved in the story from part to part. In this third part it gets serious. Because the villain is attacking the earth. Here too, new heroes are added, such as Spiderman and Doctor Strange. The technical effects in this part are extremely overwhelming and well done. Camera, sound and music result in a uniform dance. The film captivates you and sprints from one action sequence to the next. Only the final remains, and with it the last part of the Avengers.",
        "I think this film is an excellent film, entertaining, thrilling and enjoyable to watch, this film also features a story that is not easy to guess and makes the audience curious and want to continue to look forward to its continuation.",
        "This is my first review on here so gonna keep it short and simple. I saw Avengers Infinity War at the midnight showing and it was so worth it, the film exceeded all my expectations and as soon as the credits rolled, I wanted to watch it again. Full of laughs and shocking moments that you won't see coming. This is one of the best superhero films ever made, GO AND WATCH IT!!! I'll be going watching this again at the cinema, no doubt about it.",
        "This is honestly my all time favorite movie, yeah they only show characters for a few seconds here and there but do y'all realize how many characters there are? i mean all i have to say is the jokes here and there made me laugh really hard spiderman (Tom Holland my king) had me bawling my eyes out and movies that make me feel emotionally connected to characters are my favorite kind of movies, i have said my peace, now go on with your day and have a blessed day.",
        "One of the best films, both visually and in terms of story line, to come out in a long time",
        "One of the best films, both visually and in terms of story line, to come out in a very long time",
        "Marvel is known for its Trash CGI movies that only Kids can like. Its just bunch of Clowns flying around trying to be Cool.",
        "Wait a second people. I see bad reviews. Predictable? Dude it's a comic based piece. What are we expecting, Batman?\n\nWithout any spoilers I think we can tell that the only one actor in the leading role was Josh Brolin as the main character Thanos. Perfectly built plot around Thanos. The ones who found holes (holes, really?) will never understand how this masterpiece was perfectly balanced and also placed Thanos short but emotional trip in the MCU.\n\nI guess the only marvel movie fans will like this movie. But for comic fans like me, who know all the characters for a long time... wow this is an additional treat to the universe that the comics gave us since we are child.\n\nLong years behind us lads! It was worth the wait! ( :",
        "Best avengers movie ever. Great laughs, action, surprises, effects. I watched it 5 times since it came out. no joke.",
        "The film is all that Marvel has promised and more. Incredible from start to finish, tense, exciting and emotional moments. Thanos is the greatest villain in film history, well developed and motivated, he is so sadistic and remarkable, and Josh Brolin's performance was fantastic. The CGI is perfect.",
        "Avengers always packed with actions and excitement . But this infinity war broke all of the records . Its the negative role played magnificently outstanding in this story . The human side of the greatest villain of time rise question about the harsh reality and defination of war . I think the God of the war stole the avengers sparks . The story tried to explain the balance of existence and told a epic story beyond writings and visualization .",
        "This movie was an experience full of adrenaline rush! for the sake of all the great fights, all our heroes stuck under the same roof. However even if it was fun and pretty much enjoyable I didn't really get into it and the problem here is the fact I am not that into the Marvel universe and this movie felt like a sequel to every standalone Marvel film that came out last year so I felt like I was missing on something, and couldn't fully connect to the story it was like starting to harry potters saga with the 4th movie, you'll enjoy the action but you won't feel passion and compassion to the characters. and this is the case with every Marvel movie I've seen so far.",
        "Marvel has been building towards this movie since the MCU began in 2008, and this movie meets every expectation for such an ambitious climax. This film doesn't get a 10 from me because I never really felt a particularly awe-inspiring moment such as I did during Captain America: Civil War, although this movie still produces plenty of scenes that make any invested fan experience a range of emotions.",
        "This thing dragged along. Didn't know half the characters. Wish I'd have saved my money.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is so good, you must see it in 3D. Every Avenger is here, from Spider-Man, to Iron Man, to Doctor Strange, to Black Panther, and others. I won't spoil anything, but this is a movie my theater was engaged in from start to finish. It surprisingly had a lot of funny parts in it, as my theater was laughing through much of the movie. My theater started booing and jeering when the credits started rolling (although many stayed through the credits in hopes of a post-credits scene).\n\nThis movie is must-see.",
        "This on was a money grab. Don't get me wrong I liked them but just this one was not for me. Sure it's good for one watch if your bored",
        "WOW! No wonder any movie related to any avengers character would be a guarantee box office!! Every character has his own charm. The computer graphic is so over the top!! Well done~",
        "The standard for every crossover movie Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think \"Infinity War\" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in \"Endgame\" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly \"Infinity War\" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.",
        "No comic movie could ever get the reaction that Infinity War gave fans throughout the world. Its emotional, funny, engrossing, action-packed and, well, different. Its the most different movie we have gotten from a superhero film to date... and thats a good thing.",
        "Review: I felt out of place because I didn't see the four or five marvel movies that helped put together this movie. The direction and screenplay are really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this three out of a possible five stars.",
        "It was very badly written. I just got out of the hall after the interval it was so bad lol!",
        "It honestly doesn't get bigger than this! We've been waiting 10 years to witness Thanos' wrath.... and it's here! In full blown force two and half hours of madness that even for how long it is , it will literally have you wanting more! A superhero masterpiece!",
        "Ok, first of all this is a cheesy pop corn movie. But hello, it is about superhero's. Ofcourse it's going to be tongue in cheek over top action. But it does it perfectly. Greatest movie of its genre and also has a bit of soul. The CGI and cast alone give it a 5 star rating. Then the movie itself rounds it off a ten. Yes ten as it doesn't put a foot wrong. Ignore the 1's. And 2's as they are just morons. Watch this movie but I'm guessing if you are reading this you already have.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is absolutely everything that every comic book film ever wanted. It had the action, humor, and heartbreaking scenes of their favorite characters died in the film, and I can't tell you who dies in the film. I really enjoyed Part 1 of Infinity War, but If you have not see Avengers: Infinity War, go see it. And don't miss one post credit scene. It might surprise the audience.\n\nThanos will return",
        "This film is so funny and dark at the same time. I had an absolute blast.\n\nThese brothers directed winter soldier and civil war, so I knew the reviews would be believable.\n\nAt solid 10/10 film with everything you didn't expect and more.",
        "This movie is the best MCU movie by far. Thanos in this movie was amazing, easily the best villain I've seen in a movie (up there with darth vadar). The story is amazing and if you have watched all the MCU movies prior then you will have no problem in understanding every part of this movie. This movie is more than just an action/superhero movie, it is a really emotional rollercoaster with twists and shocks. Without spoiling anything, this movie will leave you shocked and craving to see what happens next for the avengers and Thanos.",
        "No one should be surprised by the film's lack of creativity. There is an evil villain who comes from space (like Freezer) who has powerful allies (like Freezer) and is looking for some infinity gems that at this point are very similar to dragon balls. By putting them together he will have immense power (as in Dragon Ball). The good guys unite and battle here and on other planets (as in Dragon Ball). The final battle aspires to be monumental and there are rare animals and structures (as in the Lord of the Rings). Some of the good guys die (as in Dragon Ball and Lord of the Rings). There is a bit of drama with relationship or relationship problems (as in any movie you've ever seen). I rescue a couple of interesting sequences that make this waste of money worth a six. If it were for the lack of creativity, artistic laziness and lack of interest generated, I would give it a three.",
        "10 years and 18 movies, we've waited and waited for our childhood fantasies to come to the big screen. This movie doesn't disappoint. In true marvel form, it gives us all the action and laughter we want, along with a wonderfully put together story. Bringing together this cast of well established characters was an awesome feat and done to perfection. Each character has their own set of little things that make them great and it was truely cinematic gold to watch these hero's meet one another. Action packed and edge of your seat adventure. There are surprises and cliffhangers and I'm sure Infinity Wars 2 will be just as entertaining.",
        "I'm surprised that almost everyone loves this movie, because there are parts that make me think \"WHAT? WHY?!\" It made me mad at the Russo Brothers until I saw \"Endgame.\"",
        "The more characters there are in a movie, the more one or two people need to be at the center of the narrative. The director chose Thanos, no problem, but no argument: his motivation is only a few words of reason?? How can the audience be emotionally invested in him when his choices and sacrifices are so inadequate? There are so many heroes that each one just shows up with a face to show that I'm there, just like a robot executing a program. Thanos is the villain in most of the scenes, but I don't think it is plump enough. Even the love between father and daughter is weak. The action is a bit less exciting, and marvel's massive Death is just a cheap way to keep the comic line in place and constantly disrupt the drama's mood as it goes along.",
        "Very good CGI, Nice Sceneries and Colors but apart from these the movie is mediocre to bad.\n\nLong, boring at some times, acting is not so good ,story is a bit messed up with plotholes etc.. The ending however is quite good and unexpected!\n\nOverall a good and fun movie for kids but a boring CGI demonstration.. for adults.\n\nVery Overrated.",
        "This is literally the best Marvel movie I have ever seen, I found it brilliantly well structured, well thought, and even just straight up funny. Anything less than this quality would have been a disappointment, and boy, this did not disappoint!",
        "Marvel has become stale and repetitive. The plots to a lot of these movies seems to always repeat it self only under different characters and the CGI stuff is just fake as ****. Unfortunately I liked this one and I don't even know why. Maybe I'm on crack. I don't know. Anyways I really don't want to say anything more because I hate myself for even saying I like this garbage.",
        "Avengers Infinity War was far from the best movie ever made but is a pretty great, the visual effects were beyond amazing, the character interactions were great, the performances are wonderful, and then their is Thanos who is by far an amazing villain, one of the best villains ever and the best Marvel villain, surprisingly the story was well done, and the 3rd act is where the meat and potatoes are, not going to spoil anything but it's not like any of the other Marvel movies. And by That right there, You get the best Marvel movie.",
        "Does Marvel deliver on Hype ? Yes Does Marvel do Justice to all Characters ? Yes Is Thanos able to match awesomeness of Avengers ? Yes Is there epic fanboy movements ? Yes Does the movie deliver the hype ? Yes Hail Marvel",
        "WTH!? I hate you Thanos, but Josh Brolin did an excellent job...I am very disappointed with the ending though.... How long do we have to wait for answers?",
        "I'm not a huge over the top marvel fan by any means but I do like some of them. I loved Wonder Woman and this one as well. There were a lot of characters and storyline but I wasn't bored and was quite impressed actually. Good emotion, heart, comical moments and of course action. I liked being introduced to the Guardians of the Galaxy because I've never seen any of those movies. Overall I liked this one and was very entertained!",
        "One of the best marvel films they've made, its got me desperately needing to see No4, so many shocking moments at the end, just brilliant",
        "Why did the producers have to keep the plot quiet till the end? Because it sucked! My kids love the Avengers, but I have since deleted all DVR recordings of them after watching this! Who in the world gave these jokes for producers money to destroy a franchise? Idiots!",
        "I watched Avengers at Midnight on release day. I have not stopped thinking about it since. My life has been consumed in way I didn't think it could be. I thought I was stronger than that. I will be going back to see this again this week, No other film in recent memory has made even consider doing that, let alone opening up an account on a generic review site just to help expel some adrenaline. I know reviews are an opinion, but if this film isn't a 10 across the board I feel a sadness for the people who voted lower, I fear what they are searching for in life does not exist.\n\nThe basically nailed it in a way that I could not imagine possible. Heck I still don't know how they got it so right! Just go and see it, then go and it again",
        "After 10 years of amazing movies, the Russo Brothers have managed to create a brilliant continuity to the stories and link them into 1. With amazing production and CG that rivals any I've seen before, I was taken into this universe and was part of every charachter's thoughts even the evil Thanos. Well played by all, well produced by Marvel, this movie is a definite must watch, Josh Brolin made me forget he was CG. Cannot wait for next year's installment",
        "I was so looking forward to this film and it did not disappoint. Epic action scenes and just the right amount of humour. I enjoy the references to the other Marvel films and I would say this is my second favourite (after Thor Ragnarok). Can not wait for the second and make sure you stat til after the end credits finish",
        "This is actually the best Avengers Movie i've ever watched, until now Captain America 3 was on the top of my \"favorite marvel movies\" but now Infinity War is on the top.\n\nThe whole thing is just amazing ! I was so scared to be dessapointed but im not at all !! Its the first time i actually cried for a marvel movie !!!\n\nIm amazed !!!\n\nCant wait to see Infinity War part 2, im ready to book my ticket in the cinema.\n\nbtw, Where is HAWKEYE ?????",
        "Suspenseful al the way through to the end. I did not like how wakanda was just used just as battleground it could have meant more but other than that I loved the movie",
        "The storyline begins it's end run with Thanos (Brolin) on his mission to collect ALL the infinity stones. The film jumps around quite often but engages the audience with the Avengers spread out and fighting separate battles. The question WHAT does Thanos really want. The answer is not trivial as we see in his dialogue and speeches, world domination and to kill half the population with the snap of his fingers.\n\nThe fight sequences as usual are tremendously done and the CGI is completely amazing. There are some funny quips along the way, inside plots and story's we see expanding. I truly liked the film BUT I was not prepared for the loss of heroes we had to suffer. I look forward to the next installment to see what happens. I give this a 9 out of 10.",
        "I hated the ending because it obviously left an open to another movie. This is stupid and I will never purchase a marvel movie again because of it. I expected a complete end to the movie",
        "Wow... paying off ten years of excellence was mostly worthwhile and genuinely shocking. This movie assumes you are a fan and know these characters. It jumps right in to the action with no set up or exposition. You are IN this movie right from the start.\n\nThe development and ground work from the other 18 films pave the way for a truly emotional drama and mind-blowing experience. And that's just what this movie is... an experience. It's a thrill ride start to finish including genuine \"white knuckle\" fear for some favorite characters. A valid complaint would have to be that this is without a doubt a part 1. It's an incomplete adventure. Yet, having to sit an entire year contemplating what we saw and what's going to happen now only adds to the fun. The after credits scenes is probably the best of any Marvel film. Also, some characters really do get very little screen time. Surprised at how little Cap, Hulk and Black Panther had to do.\n\nOverall, Infinity War is every bit as epic as advertised and a year can't fly by fast enough.",
        "The movie was average, nothing out of the ordinary. Marvel has already set the standard for the superhero movie and clearly doesn't plan on antagonizing the cash-flow formula of it's success. I will never understand the Black Panther lure and I don't consider it to be a legitimate superhero...and I've tried. Also bored with Evans as he just cannot act. Everything else was well done.",
        "How does an audience connect with a giant purple cg Josh Brolin? Younger people will have no problem with it I suspect. They are part of the gaming generation/culture. For those who desire an experience that is bit more grounded. Blast off in your rocket pack. So much of this movie is cgi it becomes distracting and even corny. The script tries to weave too many characters into a straight forward story. The result is a messy flat video game movie the equivalent to children playing with their action figures at recess.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War - This superhero epic definitely lives up to the hype, with amazing action sequences, the perfect amount of humor, and great character interaction.",
        "Th russo brothers truly went all out directing a visual spectaculal, with a great plot, soundtrack and gathering all the MCU characters from tbe 10 years of MCU. Josh Broslin as Thanos steels the film as one of tbe best villians yet. Althouth there are some pacimg issues, this film is definitely ranked high up ad one of the best comic book films I have ever seen.",
        "Due to the most recent release of Avengers: Infinity War, the writer of this review has abstained from writing the movie review on this movie.",
        "As I do all the Marvel films constantly look out for Stan Lee and he arrives pretty quickly in this one.Had to admit had a little chuckle at my over enthusiasm at looking out for Mr lee.But there you go my review of this film is from my initial will it won't it be good or great after my last foray into the marvel universe left me feeling a little less than thrilled with Avengers Age Of Ultron and it being one that I wanted to finish as needed to see it through to the end in a desperate desire that it may get better toward the end but unfortunently it didn't. Infinity War however was absolutely the opposite holding my curiosity from start to finish. Incorporating a entire cornucopia of Marvel characters and holding you on the edge of your seat until the end. If as I started I was metamorphasised into the aforementioned mentioned Mr Lee I would be more than happy with this showpiece of the fantastic realm that is Marvel.",
        "I saw avengers infinity war last night and I had to pick my jaw off the floor. While this movie is huge and filled with some amazing hereos it should actually be named Thanos: infinity war. While it mainly follows thanos on his journey we see just how powerful, and intimidating he is. The Russo brothers had high expectations for this movie and they delivered. This movie is too big to just see once, good thing I'm seeing it again tonight!",
        "Although visually cool, the story is full of flaws only help a poorly deisgned plot. Heroes are nvincible or weak when needed by the story, Thanos is randomly cruel or nice, stones are used only when the story needs them...\n\nIf you are able to totally shut down your brain for more than 2 hours, you might like some GCIs.",
        "This movie is one of the top movies on this site, and rightfully so. The majority has spoken, so pay no attention to the anti-Marvel trolls who are rating this movie a 1 star. I'm an unbiased reviewer here because I am not normally a comic fan. I have to say that I have seen this film first hand and was thoroughly entertained. I was dragged here by my boyfriend but surprisingly enjoyed it. Great storyline, insane CGI, excellent fight scenes, drama, comedy, just about everything. Seeing this in 3D is even better. 10/10 and nothing less",
        "A movie that's gonna be remembered for many decades to come. Epic movie. Why are all the ONE STAR reviews most helpful? Are you kidding me? 10/10",
        "Avengers Infinity War its more than good, its funny, exciting, sentimental and manages to find a balance when using its characters, thanos is a better villain of the MCU, and the truth revives by much my love for the genre of superheroes.",
        "I could not stay calm throughout this movie. I felt every kind of emotion possible. Watch this movie!",
        "This film is quite a blast the a film like this with so many character's should be bad but this film does it well you will have a damn good if you are a marvel fan but if you have not seen any of the other film's you won't like it.",
        "Avoiding spoilers, this film is a thrill ride. Its well paced, with good back story to Thanos as we learn who he is, and why he is who he wants to be. Some absolutely more than epic funny moments as all the heroes we have grown up with over the years meet and team up with each other to beat Thanos. I can't think of a single thing wrong with this movie.\n\nThe ending has been hot topics since it released into cinema however, I enjoyed the ending. Its surprisingly takes a dark turn and ends in an odd way. However this part 1, and part 2 will be shortly following next year.\n\nBut in my opinion so far its one of the best Marvel Films I have seen since Iron Man. It was done very very well, and the film did not feel overwhelmed with all its heroes.",
        "Nothing about this movie is memorable. The story was so bad that had to be sololy to make another movie after this which they did.",
        "This movie is absolutely marvelous ! from the beginning to end, full on mind blowing actions ,hilarious scenes And funny dialogues .Fast paced ; Highly engaging screenplay ; a lot of superheros in this movie! all are right fit ,everybody got their wonderful moments ! Stunning cinematography , great background score work . AND well talented perfect direction to this gigantic film ! INFINITY WAR IS OUTSTANDING ,EMOTIONAL, SHOCKING AND SPECTACULAR BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT\n\nMY RATING -9.8 OUT OF 10 !!!",
        "Best marvel movie of all marvel movies. This movie does not disappoint. I had really high expectations going in and when I left the theater, this movie blew way past my expectations. Absolutely amazing how they pieced everything together. A little bit of suspense, comedy, drama. Overall this is just an amazing movie. When I said the best marvel movie, it is literally the best marvel movie out there even if you included the fox family. I gave it a 10 because it was very well deserved. I really wished the mutants played roles on this movie just like the comics but unfortunately fox is in the way. Even though the lack of mutants divided the MCU I still feel obligated to give it a 10 because it most certainly deserved it. great job to all who worked on this movie. This is probably not part of the review but I saw a very old couple watching this movie, like I mean 80 years old old and this just shows how marvel comics and the characters created transcends generations after generations which is great because it brings everyone together.",
        "With too many heroes to give attention to, the film flounders trying to attempt to give some sort of drama to a big purple power ranger who looks and acts like the least threatening villain since Goldar.\n\nWhile the superhero action is crunchy and bashy and all things visually appealing, the audience is left wanting more. Action should be used to drive the story forward, not as filler in-between pauses in the story.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War does not disappoint. There are many serious and light-hearted scenes, yet they are timed perfectly as to not undermine the emotional impact of other scenes. Marvel holds nothing back, and no one is safe. The plot was fast paced and filled with action with brief moments of rest in between. Thanos is not your typical villain as he struggles with his own decisions. Overall, a very good film.",
        "Avengers started off REALLY great, gets a LITTLE long in the tooth after an hour and a half and wraps up with a HEAVY but at the same time rather anti-climactic ending that feels incomplete as a movie... pretty good but not GREAT. First hour was dynamite though.",
        "The story was so so great , I really like it too much . the acting was magnificent , and the fighting scenes were amazing. It's really worth my time , that's why I recommend it to all.\n\n8/10",
        "Just amazing,so amazing! I walked out the movie theater with a broken jaw Just so fun to watch and crazy how they mad this film just so amazing!",
        "This is by far the best Marvel move made to date, and I feel like I say that after each one I've seen but this will absolutely be a staple in the franchise. Everything was done to perfection. Action 10/10, Humor 10/10 (Well executes and timed), Suspense 10/10, Drama 10/10. You get the picture. Best. One. To. Date.",
        "Meh, its alright. The CG is nice The fights are cool The Story is dumb The deaths of no weight Their was no reason to care what happened",
        "Hey! Yes i mean it. Watch this movie before the time runs out. Best of the best. The end will give you big big punch. The only sad part of this movie is that we have to wait patiently for the next year Avengers. Just staggering!!!! And ya.. just don't miss the post credit scene. I repeat, do not miss..!!",
        "Baffles me how people can genuinely sit through this cringe fest. Watch more movies.",
        "You know you can wrap a a pile of poo in pretty paper and bow but still a pile of poo and thats what this movie is sooooo disapointed",
        "It beautiful visual effects, fantastic directing, emotional, epic, funny, fun, dark, intense, etc. The movie is mostly action and adventure so there technically isn't a build up. Instead the movie starts off with a bang all the way until the end of the film. It has a balance of almost every genre and the Villain was extremely well written with a reasonable backstory behind his name.",
        "This is my favourite movie of all time. Action,comedy, and good old comic book fights. Loved it",
        "I'd like to say I don't understand how anyone could like this except I know how much people lack empathy for characters or just enjoy being upset. I personally don't. And i dread every movie with hero crossovers as they supersede anything that could have mattered from one of the stand alones. I don't get invested in super hero stuff because of movies like this. Hope everyone likes their soap opera in tights.",
        "Best marvel movie yet it is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen",
        "This is quite simply phonomenal, unique and stands out to all other marvel movies. I would recommend this to almost anyone.",
        "Just neglect the so called reviews.Its personal views and differs from person to person.Make your own review and keep it to yourself.",
        "This movie is a mind blowing as it contains marvel universe. My all expectation is about AVENGERS 4. After the tragedy, i only imagines about next .",
        "All I can say is wow, been a marvel fan since the 80s and this just blows any other superhero movie away love love love",
        "What happens when your favorite heroes from all the MCU movies come together? Answer: Greatness. This movie has great action, comedy, and even some very sad moments. It shouldn't work but it does. You have a great villain who is empathetic, dangerous, and respectful. You've got Star-Lord, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Gamora, Spider-man, Rocket, Drax, Black Widow, Vision, Groot, Black Panther and so many other characters. Everyone has a good joke. Some of the scenes will even bring tears to the younger or more sensitive viewers. This movie's ending is awesome, yet it still leaves you wanting for more. If you love any of these heroes your in luck. You must watch the movie for it is absolutely awesome.",
        "I was bought a ticket at the cinema for this film and didn't really want to go. Don't get me wrong I love Marvel, I love DC more but everything Marvel is good and worth a watch but I thought this film was a step too far for the cinema, I couldn't really be bothered after Black Panther, another Marvel movie, groan....... Anyway, the actually film was flipping amazing!!!! There was none of the back stories or build ups or fluff pieces it was just a load of super heroes kicking backside!!!! Thor just owned it to be honest, Iron Man is awesome and my favourite character, Downey Junior carries the character now to be honest, they just keep increasing his powers probably to match these super duper evil guys but I dont think they need to, he is awesome as he is without extra nano super ridiculous hammer tech!! Make the armour harder and the beams more powerful to be honest or something, he doesn't need guardians of the galaxy god powers manipulating his suit. Anyway, the film is the beat yet even though I didn't want to see it, THOR rocks.",
        "Whatever the story lacks, Computer CGI compensates.",
        "I should start by saying I've only given 10/10 to two other movies, that's how rarely I give them. This has all the elements of a great movie, I couldn't ask for more. It took me through various different emotions; and it kept me excited and on the edge of my seat. I couldn't wait for what would happen next.. and it never ended.. The action just kept coming. The movie made me feel like I was part of the avengers, and as if I was being carried along this enjoyable, exciting journey; and I found myself cheering for them. I just loved it.",
        "I love this! I like the plot, the actions, the casts. When I watched this one, I was expecting something big, spectacular as the closing of Avanger series. Unfortunately when Endgame was released (I queued on line and got uncomfy seat in the cinema because so many people wanted to see it), I disappointed with that. Now, I'm remembering this film and comparing it with previous Avenger series, if I can give score and review this, I'll put rate 9 for this one and 6 for Endgame. I still remember the actions and storyline in Infinity Stone, but all I can remember about Endgame is just about the first 30 minutes in boring conversation film.",
        "This movie is a bit longer than 2 hours, it took me about 4 hours to finish it.\n\nWhy? Because I paused frequently. To check this, to do that. Basically, I was bored.\n\nIt was too jumbled, too many heroes in the same room. First half in: way too many jokes. I swear I was expecting someone to fart at some point.\n\nall the others looked pretty worn out and tired as I felt at the end of this movie.\n\nNot many sparks. Mostly CGI and fan fiction. And dramatic music, pretty much non-stop.\n\nNo soul. No soul is the death of love.",
        "This movie is epic in all definitions. 19 movies to add up to this and it could not have been better. I was slightly skeptical a couple of years back, but after the last couple of Marvel movies (Doctor Strange, Black Panther and Thor Ragnorok) I had high hopes, and they were most def met!!! This movie makes the inner comic book nerd child in me drool in amazement!",
        "There were a lot of great things about this film, Thanos being the highlight of the film, but still it did feel a little crammed at times. Some things about this film were overdramatised And it felt at times there was too much going on.\n\nSaying that though on a pure enjoyment and plot scale this film does almost everything right. It was not predictable which meant there was genuine surprise for the plot twists. Overall Marvel have done a good job with this movie bar a few details but still a great movie overall.",
        "Marvel studio outdoes itself once again in the Avengers series. How is it that a film of this nature could be so grandiose and powerful? Can be so heroic yet funny at the same time? The malleability of the team is simply incredible and you just feel the culmination of years of hard work paying off in this masterpiece. The antagonist's ambition and motive may be simple, but it feels realistic and most important asks questions about humanity and mankind, making him one of the best villain the series has showcased. The film is also a treat to the eye, and perhaps the best showcase of modern cinema. The only negative is perhaps the lack of closure, the feeling of yearning for more. There is no doubt that the film is a cash cow for Disney, but if anything it is a gorgeous golden cow, just keep milking it please.",
        "Amazing movie making experience tying together all all of the various Avenger themed films into one, huge super hero adventure. It was kind of fun remembering which character was with which. The film is long, with some of the expostional dialogue dragging down the spectacular set pieces, but I still enjoyed it and the script has plenty of humour. In my mind Marvel still out weighs DC when it come to character development and story telling",
        "Where has her accent gone? She was European in the last movie. Now she's American?",
        "Well i diddn't expect something different .a Brilliant movie with Awesome Villain and Great humor .it totally lives up to The hype",
        "Even if I overlook the Witzelsucht - the lame, inane attempts at humor - there are many other reasons to dislike this movie. Instead of expending the effort to portray the hulk longer than one moment, it actually upscales a little person. WTF? I will never pay to see another Marvel production!!",
        "This is the greatest super hero movie of all time.",
        "Thats why she was never around in the current Avengers movies.. And also.. Why her beacon is a 90s era pager.. Haha sorry I'm slow.. But I just realized that while watching CM.",
        "Honestly this movie is equivalent to Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows Part 1. (An awful movie in the series) Yes (as all other reviewers who given it an 8 or higher have argued) this movie has had a lot of build up and it is meant to be the \"final\" act; however that doesn't excuse it's inability to create an interesting plot. Similar to HPDH1, this movie focuses too much on setting up for part 2 that is seems like this was more of a money grab. It is a movie worth seeing but perhaps not in theaters. I suggest, have more self control than me and wait until the second part comes out so you can immediately gain some closure that the first part fails to achieve.",
        "The most intense, complex, and stirring Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet. Its kind of amazing is how seamlessly the various pieces of the Marvel fit together. Avengers: Infinity War successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. This is the movie not to be missed.",
        "How they made such a great film with so many characters is amazing. Loved it",
        "It's mind blowing,amazing,thrilling movie.Specially i liked Thanos.Thank you MARVEL and Russo Brothers.I cant wait Part 2.",
        "This is the movie I've been waiting for ever since Thanos was shown at the end of \"The Avengers\" and it was worth the wait. War is right because there is so much action, funny, sad but worth every second. Though I would have expected it to be a little bit more serious in the matter since Thanos is trying to wipe off half the population. Bubbles was not necessary for this film either and the Black Order was not as powerful as I would expect them to be. In all though a fantastic film with such a great villain in Thanos. He lives up to his nickname the \"Mad Titan\" and he's basically the main character in this film since he has character build up than any other character in the film. If there is any superhero movie to be seen this year it is this one none can come close to this amazing film!!",
        "The movie overall was great, and while I'll keep this spoiler free, I highly recommend that you go in with absolutely no expectations regarding character deaths. I went in with a mindset of who I felt, that I knew was gonna die. Now when it came down to it, and I saw how wrong I was, I was upset, and while I was thinking of it, I had no one to blame but myself, the movie was fantastic, and one of the best superhero movies out there. Please. Don't. Go. In. With. Expections.",
        "From the moment it starts you are on the tip of your seat. Every scene is critical and are non-fillers. Thanos packs a punch and all the Avengers catch a piece of it. So much happened it's worth a second trip to the movies.",
        "What a bad movie from marvel, it is not satisfying at all had many stars with a million place cutting off the story every 15 minutes.",
        "The Russo Brothers have created something that could have messed up really bad. But it doesn't and is complete perfection. Lets me first start off by saying the wait for Thanos was definitely worth it. Josh Brolin puts in a spectacular performance into Thanos and really does scare you and most importantly you buy his motives, I would even go as far as saying that Thanos is maybe the best MCU villain to date. Another thing that I would applaud the Russo Brothers for is definitely not pulling any punches, when action is needed it is great, even better than their last superhero movies. And when their is emotion needed you definitely feel it. But one of my favorite things in this movies is the Universal stakes really hit home on a visceral level were this may not be the case on many of the past comic book movies. Lastly, this is not a stand alone movie, this is a movie one decade int he making and you definitely feel that fro the opening credits to the end credits. I would strongly recommend anyone who has invested time into this series to watch this movies or maybe even your casual moviegoer.",
        "Only avengers movie that I actually enjoyed. All the other ones are garbage. Still don't get how its rated so high ?",
        "The key points are so stupid, I know you are going to make a sequel, I know that the future can be rewritten, but that punch was really stupid.",
        "Wow. Just wow! That's really all I have to say.\n\nWhat an emotional roller coaster. There were a few times where I almost cried. The detail of the movie, the acting, the directing, the music, the countless hours of special effects work that went into this movie.....beyond my imagination! Well and beyond my expectations of a Marvel movie. But this is not your normal Marvel movie. This is a HEAVY movie. Please see at your own discretion.",
        "It might just be my favourite Marvel movie. It cuts out all the boring stuff I don't like from the other movies and only keeps in the stuff I like, which makes this the quintessential Marvel movie for me. However, I feel like this movie may have been a little too good. I like this one so much, that I honestly don't have much reason to go back to any of the other Marvel movies. Infinity War has all my favourite elements from all of them and none of my least favourite. Why sit through the others when I can just watch this and get my fix? Anyway, this movie was great and I can't wait for Avengers: Endgame!!",
        "More serious drama from Disney aimed at teenagers and above. Should be more universal. I'd prefer it to have been more fun like Guardians of the Galaxy.",
        "An amazing theory filled with action packed drama, avengers infinity war definitely nails it when it come to hero movies, and definitely does not fail to disappoint all hero movies",
        "So many movies were made before this title. Connecting them all and binding them is remarkable...then to make the audience think question what happens in the next movie!...that's gold sensational... This movie is done so well that it is plotted for its sequels...I would say the enitire movie infinty war ends like anyother movie's inmtermission phase...The difference is we have wait till they screen the sequel...Sad thing for was the way they have pictured HULK..,but it was intelligently prepared if you seen Ragnarok...Thanos the mad titan is really strongly convinced with his ideals...but his ideals is questionably stupid. Thor's character from his earlier movies of being a hot headed barbarian to the rise of godliness is well put in this movie. Gaurdian of Galaxy guys...the all had improtant roles to play..especially Groot and Gamora. I would recommend this movies to other but after watching a Marathon of all the movies earlier. Only that can bring out complete enjoyment of this movie.",
        "I don't usually write reviews but after I saw this I knew I had to. This movie had a great combination of action, story, and it's fair amount of tears throughout. I feel like if you're going to see this see it in the theater with your friends not by yourself. You'll need someone to talk to after the movie.",
        "I wonder why the ranking of 2018 is higher than 2015. The thing that i hate about this one is those strange creatures. What the hell the talking rabbit doing here !! Is it a cartoon for 5 years kids?!",
        "Great film with plenty of action, adventure and did i mention action packed ? . Yes this is a film for the saturday night roster enjoy",
        "If there was any more CGI, they might as well have made a cartoon.\n\nThe dialog and delivery was just cheesy.\n\nGiven the massive variety of powers, strengths and vulnerabilities of the characters, there should have been plenty of the more human based ones that were crushed or crippled if they were subjected to the brutal fights.\n\nI get that it's a comic book film, and disbelief needs suspending, but this was just utter cr@p",
        "Very well done movie Tense Gripping Fun Clear Exciting\n\nMy only real critique is that there were moments that were meant to be very emotional that kinda fell flat. But that wasn't enough to make it a bad movie.\n\nIf you like Marvel at all, watch this movie. You won't regret it.",
        "Not too bad but really overhyped, Boring in some places, funny ay other ones, i rate with 6 because was entertaining and has good effects but ser not enough for being a movie, i didnt liked it, sorry.",
        "My bf for some reason enjoys these comic book movies, with the exception of Deadpool, Thor Ragnarok I don't see why fandom. I have seen three now where the story jumps about, the cockiness of the protagonists of not willing to work together, hence why they fail dragging these scenes way longer than they need to. This film could have ended If Starlord didn't interupt the gauntlet removal, or Thor not doing a head shot which he should have known. Somewhat predictable, and felt like 3 seperate unit directions going and slapped and edited together to make a film. I prefer spy, giallo, comedy, action, Thriller things with realism.",
        "Amazing movie from start to finish, love every moment, to see our hero's struggle against Thanos, and a movie been long awaited and didn't disappoint, defiantly in my opinion best Marvel movie.",
        "MARVEL AT ITS FINEST ! Infinity War is an absolute achievement !",
        "The other reviewers are all trolls hating on this movie. This movie was amazing and one of the best",
        "This simply should not have worked.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War is one of the most ambitious films in cinema history. I have so much respect for the Russo brothers for managing to make a film with this many characters and this many plot points feels cohesive and endlessly entertaining. I think the real triumph of Infinity War is how watchable and fun this movie is despite being 2 1/2 hours long, full of characters and constantly hitting you in the face with really depressing stuff. Let's hope that the Russo brothers can pull of the same trick twice.",
        "That's all you need to know if you are an emotional person. I went through tons. I can't wait for Endgame to come out to complete this movie.",
        "It's been 10 years since this cinematic universe kicked for with 2008s Iron man. And oh boy does this film deliver on everything. It's action-packed, hearbreaking, thrilling and everything it should've been! This film was well worth the 10 build up and now it's just 1 year for the next one to see how this story unfolds.",
        "This one was for the true fans. I can relate to those who have no real vested interest in these characters. It's a long, confusing, space war movie with cool special effects. But to the true fans who knew almost exactly what to expect, or knew what or whom they were seeing; this film is a modern masterpiece. The magnum opus of the MCU. What other superhero movie in a universe known to be free of consequence could invoke such a broad dynamic of emotion? I am a grown man, jaded to most things in this world, and I shed more tears for this film than any other. I also loved the humor. There were times when I couldn't help but belt out a hearty HA much to my embarrassment. But at times I could hear a symphony of noses sniffling behind me. This one may be hard for young children, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't see it. I saw it standard, but now I know that I need to see this in IMAX before the opportunity is lost forever. If I could give it 11 stars, I would. Don't wear makeup to this one.",
        "This movie deserves all the positive reviews that it's getting. It stays true to what Marvel is and it only makes me more excited for Avengers 4. Nothing wil be the same. So worth the time. Will absolutely have to see it again. 10/10.",
        "I'd waited years for this film, perhaps that's why I felt a bit let down. Over all the acting was great, and the action better, but with dozens of characters struggling for screen time, the movie was rused and hurried from one scene to the next.\n\nThe space scenes were excellent, but the plot back on Earth involving the Earth bound heroes could have been handled much better. Perhaps when the second half of this story comes out, I'll change my tune, but I enjoyed the previous two Avengers films much more.",
        "I worried I'd, in my mind, hyped this movie up too much. But it was the movie I needed! Brilliant ... fingers crossed the sequel Mensa all the damage Thanos has inflicted on the universe!",
        "Absolutely my favorite marvel movie. Wonderful acting, action , comedy & drama all mixed together like never before. Highly recommend to watch in IMAX!!!",
        "This movie kicks so much ash that i cant think of another superhero movie that have maked me so exited and impressed after leaving the cinema. There is nothing wrong with this film, acting amazing, characters you just care about and a story that tales you on a journey you wont forget any time soon. One word masterpiece.",
        "This movie got me full chub. I was rock hard the whole time. Thank you marvel.",
        "Excellent movie Best marvel movie Watched it a few times now... If you don't like DC or MARVEL.. please do not leave negative comments as your opinions do not matter!",
        "It's an alright movie but in my opinion it's not the best MCU movie tho",
        "After watching Infinity War last night my heart still hasn't dropped to under 100 bpm. The movie is breathtakingly beautiful, and will make you feel almost every emotion possible. The Russo brothers did an amazing job balancing the enormous cast, and made a movie which scale has never been scene before! The movie is entertaining from the first minute, and will leave you with your jaw on the floor. My only regret is, that every time I will watch a movie in the future, I will compare it to Infinity War, and I am afraid it won't even be close",
        "Wow! This was amazing. I'm still racking my brain with what happened in this movie. The action was amazing. The plot was emotionally charged. And next to Black Panther, the best Marvel movie ever made.",
        "Yes, it's worth watching on the big screen for the incredible MCU-multi-main-character action showdown sequences, that all these films have built up to, as well as the relentless pacing from it's \"medias res\" opening. It's also a welcome change because it pulls the rug from under most triumphalistic (Disney) American films in that it's wiling to eliminate characters and leave the audience at a loss to how the narrative will move forward in a world where the ones you're counting on are so utterly defeated. But what's most striking, and terrifying, is how timely the film is (the Russo brothers' helmed Marvel films have said a lot about our socio-political realties) with a villain that views the world as a zero-sum game and so believes it is righteous to cast aside entire populations.",
        "Thanos a well written villain however he can be slightly boring, props To Josh Brolin. This doesn't change the fact that this and most of the Other MCU movies are absolute rubbish, not worth watching unless ur a child Otherwise I recommended you speak to a doctor",
        "It was an amazing movie. Sometimes I was laughing or I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next . Can't wait for part 2. I recommend this movie to all marvel fans out there. Thanos is one of my favorite marvel villains ever Josh Borlin did a fantastic job playing a villain.",
        "Infinity war's hype was huge. so much nobody thought it can live up to that. I myself was ready to be disappointed. Boy i was WRONG and i couldn't be more happy. Russo brothers nailed it. they made something seemingly impossible. putting all those heroes together without making it too crowded, and everyone of them has something to do. Action is great, acting is perfect, story is very good, CGI is impressive and Thanos is by far the best MCU villain ever created. focusing on Thanos help the movie to keep it together and preventing it from falling apart. everything spins around Thanos and his motivations and it's better this way. I was hooked to my chair when watching it, lots of surprise, shocking moments and perfectly directed. it deserve every penny you spend. DO NOT MISS THIS.",
        "A Marvel fan would love this film, action packed, and enjoyable plot. However, if your not a marvel fan or watched it in a while you will have to catch of with some of the most recent films however avoid if you don't like marvel films as it will only be a jumble of nonsense.",
        "This movie was funny, exciting, epic, and emotional. Marvel rewards the fans who have been watching every marvel movie for the past decade with an epic superhero movie that will never be duplicated. By far the best aspect of this film is the interactions between the characters, which were brilliantly written and well acted. Is this movie perfect? No. Of course this movie has some trouble combining all the characters together while attempting to move the plot forward, but everything comes together perfectly with the most emotional and gut wrenching ending to any superhero movie I've every seen.",
        "We are waiting for this movie and finally it cames ! Everything on it was amazing. The story and the characters perfect, the plow twist fantastic and the end........OH MY GOD !!!!! I'm looking for the part 2 !!!!",
        "But we knew that, right? So Infinity War is just like a good warm up for the great finale. That means my rating is not quite relevant because i can't get rid of a feeling Infinity War is just a half of the movie. But i must admit it's a damn good half. And now the long waiting starts.",
        "This movie is a cash cow for a good reason...it is an exciting first of a two part conclusion to the build up of Marvel super heroes over the past decade, beginning with Iron Man, leading the fight to Thanos's realm. I watched it in Cinemark XD which was a let down, then second time in Dolby AMC and finally in AMC IMAX. The IMAX experience was the best and I can't wait to own an Infinity War bluray to add to my collection. Furthermore, this movie is a great conversation starter with family members and friends to discuss what happens next. The visuals are stunning, the sound is fantastic and the standout characters were Thanos and Thor. This movie is approaching 2 billion dollar mark and hopefully it should reach it, because it is worth your money spent. I highly suggest IMAX, it was awesome. Looking forward to the second part in 2019!",
        "You make it into a movie that is even worse.\n\nI remember the Infinity Toaster, Infinity Baby Pins, blah blah, Marvel just kept pounding out the cr*p, just throw the word Infinity in front of it.\n\nAnd they would not stop.\n\nHow do you kill comic book movies? Keep making this.",
        "Don't listen to reviews, go off the internet even don't watch the trailers and don't contact many people, coz this is a movie u should only watch as a comic book fan or an mceu fan if you have followed their storylines until this point. Watch it just for the pure joy of being at the movies, no pros no cons no analysis, just watch it for once and sit back for a while to just feel the amount of emotions run through you. It's an exceedingly overwhelming movie. And all credit must go to the makers of this movie here Marvel, Russo brothers, marcus and mcfeely, and all the technical staff. This is a huge dream not only we as audiences watched but Marvel also watched, which came alive in a grand fashion here on celluloid. Movie delivers on all aspects ,expectations, excitement, thrills and even a lot of chills. As lots of surprises and shocks coming your way so, don't try to figure out much coz you won't be able to guess, unless you want spoilers. Trust me it will affect you very deeply but for good for the most part.",
        "I absolutely love this movie, it's something I have been craving to see ever since I was a little kid. Marvel shattered my expectations and to this day, it still makes me excited while sitting at the edge of my seat. Everything about this film is brilliant, there is no dull moment, and it'll keep you entertained through the entire running time!!",
        "Since I have watched a lot of films & anime, I rarely am excited at the movies. But the great Titan Thanos has blown my jaded mind to pieces. A must watch masterpiece, not just for the story or action or direction, but for how well balanced & entertaining it was.",
        "Sorry folks, this movie was ridiculous. Not to mention that it was a dishonor to prime superheroes. It was like \"let's see how many heroes and mind numbing perpetual non stop action we can cram into the same movie\" , not caring about the flow, emotion or even if any of it made sense anymore. And seriously guys, after everything that went down in Ragnorok, Thor's long awaited proclimation as King of Asgard and the salvation of the Asgardian people, to have it all decimated in the beginning of this film was total crap. Marvel needs a huge enema for a Disney flush out and bring Marvel back to its glory. Sorry folks.....In my humble opinion, I give it a thumbs down ... and only 2 stars, just for Disney's ballz for pulling this crappy film off. What a shame...Disney got to you too, Stan Lee. They even got you to cut Thor's hair off in Ragnorok....that just about wraps it up.",
        "The movie is awesome If anyone want to understand the Avengers The endgame, they should watch this movie\n\nThe most important thing in this movie is the weapon Thor got (Stormbreaker) which is really one of the strongest weapon as it fail the attack of gauntlet",
        "It's a great movie and it's worth seeing. You've done well in making this movie *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\\10",
        "Three hours of life I will never get back. Pure crap!!!!! Why do people like this garbage?",
        "This is an easy film to spoil, so I will keep it brief. Thanos (Josh Brolin) gathers a group of bad guys with the quest of obtaining all the infinity stones. His goal is to save the universe by killing off half of its life with the snap of a finger...and enjoy the sunset. The film combines all the Marvel characters available to do a film to fight the villains and Stan Lee to play a bus driver. The feature assumes you have seen all the other films as there is zero introduction of character, and hopes you have forgotten a few minor details that conflict with the current film.\n\nThe film is generally darker than previous films, but still has the humor. I wished Star Lord had discovered a new tape whereby he could defeat Thanos. Not thrilled with the plot or ending. The production works with 3 subplots for much of the feature. The ending...well we know what happens next with a go back in time and let's hose this series up like they did X-Men.",
        "Best marvel movie to date! All the hype let to this you would be a fool to miss this movie",
        "Otherwise this movie gonna suck This movie had great scenes But with these great scenes there where also plot holes.Spiderman for me doesnt fit in the avengers he has no experience .",
        "This movie exceeded all my expectations. It was hilarious, action packed, emotional, devastating, everything a movie should be. After the movie ended, everyone in the cinema literally sat there for 10 minutes thinking what just happened. Rarely does a movie have such impact on the audiences. I am looking forward to the next one even more now.",
        "The perfect #Marvel movie, plus the post credit GOLD to me...",
        "Everyone in here partying it up. No time for talkie talk. Action all over the place. Then pow pow guts you at the end. Blinders on if not a 10. Fun movie here it is. Watch",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is a movie we have never seen before. Having been 10 years in the making Infinity War does not disappoint! There is so much going on in this movie that you will have to see it at least twice! The action is fantastic, the special effects are amazing, & the pacing is perfect. Just when you think \"It's been awhile since I've seen....\" they bring them right back into the action. Every Marvel film has led to this. While it does end with an amazing cliffhanger, it's going to keep us on the hook desperately waiting for Avengers 4. Acting standouts are Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Robert Downy Jr., Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, & Josh Brolin. Not that anyone else wasn't good, these were just the people we saw the most. I CAN NOT WAIT till the next one!!!!",
        "Awesome movie - watches it at least 2-3 times. Best movie from Marvel ever - can't wait for its sequel End Game. Perfectly executed across all the superheroes.",
        "I was simply amazed by this movie and it had nothing to do with my low expectations caused by Age of Ultron or Ragnarok. The action starts in the first minutes and ends just before the credits roll up. Really good plot and even better characters. Like, they have made 3 Thor movies and the coolest Thor you will ever see is in this movie. Thanos is by far the best villain I have seen in any super-hero movie (MCU and DC). Just joking, no one will be better than Nolan's Joker :). But better than any villain MCU developed so far. My only regret is that Infinity War 2 didn't started right away, right there in the cinema. We'll have to wait one more year for that and I have a feeling that will be at least as good as this one. If you spend money in the past for Ant-Man, GOTG2 or any other slightly meaningless Marvel movie and think about skipping this one, trust me, you will regret it.\n\nYou have to see this movie as soon as possible.",
        "Special effects are good but I didn't want to watch video game effects, totally not worth it.",
        "From start to finish, IW is going full speed ahead. Multiple storylines happening seamlessly.",
        "I watched the film Endgame, just the day before today, and it was amazing, so I gave it a brief but powerful review. Then, I realized I had forgotten to thank the film that led to Endgame, the one that broke my heart and warmed it at the same time. This film made me laugh, made me sit on the edge of my seat, made me cry, and made me infuriated for some people, making me want to throw a punch. This film makes you feel all the emotions: heartbreak, happiness, humor, and even fear. This will leave you wailing and complaining, needing more to satisfy you. Endgame is certainly more emotional and powerful than this one, with the topping 9.2 ratings, while this one is conveniently sitting at 8.5. This film and Endgame both made me confident, standing up to cruelty in my school, and letting me embrace how far Marvel has come.",
        "Infinity Wars was a breathtaking film. It knocked the wind out of me, on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I needed to know. It was very exciting and intriguing to watch them. Almost everyone started breaking into sobs while the ending happened, now, I'm not going to tell what happened, because I hate when someone spoils a film for me, so I won't do that for other people. It was intriguing, and packed full of action. It was amazing to see all the Marvel Avengers group together and reunite. Some things were completely unexpected, which made it so worth it to watch. If you haven't, watch Infinity Wars.",
        "not afraid to go against the grain\nwell acted\naction and visuals are on point\narguably better than endgame",
        "There is honestly nothing to complain about with this movie. The entire Avengers series has led up to this moment. Now, i know there's a second part coming soon, but as far as the first part is concerned, it started off great following the events of Civil War and Ragnarok, the characters are great as ever, the action was awesome, and the comedy was spot on, I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire movie. There is no reason any person shouldn't watch this. Great movie for all.",
        "It's ok but people calling it a \"masterpiece\" is just wrong. A saying that I completely agree with is that less like a film but more like an event. I think the hype is elevating it to an unfair status.",
        "I have never written a review for a movie, but this movie was so good that took the time to write and let people that this movie is the truth. There is not one moment when you will be bored, it's funny, it has action, good storyline, keeps you engaged at all times. Marvel never seems to fail.",
        "This one is a 'kickass'. The one even the celebrities would line up to watch. It releases the inner child in you and let it, it feels good. ;) If you haven't seen Captain America series, Iron Man series, Thor series, Guardians of the Galaxy series, Avengers series, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, this movie is not going to make sense. Watch them all and then hit the BIG screen. :)\n\nPeace Out!",
        "The movie was only half as good as they made me think it would be. They did a great job on the story, but they did leave a few plotholes. I was really suprised by Thanos' character. He wasn't just a big scary purple alien. He is actually very complex and cool. He felt more like a human being (alien being..) then some of the hero's.",
        "Worth to wait for 10 years and can't wait for the second part",
        "No history, too many heroes, and nothing with sense. Marvel has no writers",
        "Infinity war is more of a event then a movie because you can't make a three act structure with that many characters it's just them fighting but the movie still works because i know all them from the previous mcu movies, the visual effects look really good especially thanos he will hold up for a while but the cgi on the humans looked little bad, the only character who has any character development is thanos if anything he's the protagonist, you get his motivation you don't agree with him but you understand it what his trying to do, there are some subtle lines that remind you about some of that characters backstory but there are some bad lines in the movie, i was little disappointed because one of the main characters didn't have a lot screen time especially concerning how big of a character he is, there too many jokes in this movie even in the emotional moments which is kind annoying, overall if your a fan of the mcu you'll like it if your not then you not going to like.",
        "Was actually bored during first 75 mins. Much better last 45 mins. Much of it seemed contrived.",
        "The best MCU film out of them all. Still can't believe the writers and producers had the stones to pull off the ending. Already seen it twice and will go again.",
        "In my opinion it's incredibly overhyped and overrated. It's just another one of those flashy 21st century marvel movies, but longer and with more emotional moments I guess. And more characters, which makes it quite messy to me. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of this genre.",
        "It's by far one of the best movies I've seen. And the best done by Marvel Studios. Authencity and respect to the original comic books are evident and gives the movie more power. The 10-year celebration for the release of the first Marvel movie certainly was filled with fireworks and an ensemble cast that you will never witness in the history of any superhero movie starting with the powerful Titan and human Thanos portrayed by a captivating performance from Josh Brolin.",
        "Beautiful and very unique event, from beginning to end. Definitely requires knowledge of the marvel universe to even have a grasp of what is going on.\n\nThe action is fantastic and completely break-taking at points. Josh Brolin does a fantastic job with Thanos, becoming one of the best parts of the entire film. Some of the shots involing him were phenomenal, being so interesting to look at. Everybody has a fantastic energy; they all give a great performance and bounce of each other.\n\nSuch a fun experience and definitely worth a watch for all fans!",
        "Haters will always hate, but I couldn't find anything worth moaning about in the 2 and a half hours i sat and watched this movie. Was pure enjoyment. A brilliant villain in thanos made the movie but thats not taking any credit away from the rest of the cast. Considering this film was jam packed full of stars, it did great to keep everyone onscreen and relivent in their own way. Great effects, real shocking moments and just an amazing fun packed entry into the franchise. Did not disappoint.",
        "Perfect blend of humour, action, syfy. This was a Marvel of a film (pun intended.) i genuinly believe if a film can make you laugh while keeping you on the edge of your seat pluss add an ending which can leave your heart in your mouth and emotionally involved......you deserve oscars.\n\nAll the best films come in trilogy's, I'm sad this is just a double.\n\nOnly rubish thing about this film is I can't go back and watch it for the first time again\n\nGreat CGI, great acting, mind blowing story and amazing film.",
        "It's a fabulous film. It's not fabulous if you dislike superheroes, but you wouldn't go to watch it in the first place would you so why are you reading this?",
        "Way too much i.e. endless fighting, CGI expressions take far longer to develop than human, barely any semblance of a plot, whether Save the Cat! or Hero's Journey it's weak and disorganized. And despite another reviewer claiming I'm \"not worth listening to,\" I have seen all other Marvel movies, many of them multiple times, and this one twice. The first and third Iron Man movies were far more enjoyable. If they'd left another hour's worth on the cutting room floor, this could have been a significantly better movie.",
        "This film features almost all the marvel's superheroes and it isnt personally entertaining to see all of them at oke place just for few moments. The most lifting factor in the whole movie is the character thanos and the background score here and there. This film is not so fun and entertaining when it is compared with many other marvel movies like black panther , spiderman,etc",
        "So i've been expecting nothing surprising from this movie. Age of Ultron was average, Civil War and Black Panther were horrible and Thor was creativly a little different but still marvel level. But IW really surprised me, i never thought they could make it interesting that everyone fights the same all mighty guy. But lets say they found a clever way that makes perfect sense. The movie itself feels like nice adventure with a lot of different settings and fights. Every character recieves enough time to feel relevant and plot appropiate. The humour is alright and sometimes even funny, never thought my grumpy self could say that. I absolutely despised the comedy in Guardians 2 and especially TLJ. Also Thanos is not a dumb villian Ultron was, he is actually interestingand has motives that one can understand, if to even relate. Thats always what makes good villians shine.\n\nAll in all i am very surprised and loved the movie.",
        "Leaves you speechless. I had to go see it a second time",
        "Truly Avengers Infinity War it's the best Marvel movie.It lived its hype and it was a big shock for all the fans.Fantastic but sad too. This movie is different than any kind of superhero movie and it had a lot of twists.The action and the acting was perfect and evey scene of the film was exciting.I recommend it to everyone because even if you're not a regular watcher of Marvel you will like this movie.",
        "It's a perfect marvel movie. What else is there to say?",
        "In this movie, the emotion is close to nothingness. However, the potential was huge.",
        "Loved the movie, great action and dialogue Can't wait for the next one to see what happens!",
        "This was a good movie. Marvel and Disney did a good one here. The comeback from boringly predictable flicks with forced jokes of phase 3 (I am looking at you Ragnarok) is good. It still had more jokes that I would like in a movie that is about destroying half the universe but then again you cannot have a Disney movie without jokes. Every character is sometimes comedic relief. As a standard Marvel/Disney movie. But it's not too overdone.\n\nNow for the story, don't forget it's Part 1. I will not spoil the story for anyone here. Now do not go in this one expecting Godfather or (as a superhero movie) Dark Knight or any top 20 IMDB movies quality acting and story (although probably the fan boys will send this one up there). But it is one of the best MCU movies to date (not the best super hero movie or the best Marvel superhero movie, but specifically to MCU)",
        "One of the best movies i've ever seen definitely the best of marvel. thanos is just awesome super villain...thank you marvel for this masterpiece!",
        "I lived the loki scenes, just that really. It is rich in characters, subplots and dynamics, much better than other avengers, but Loki is the best. Too bad what happens to him, in such silly way.",
        "The storyline of the movie is awesome . VFX , sounds effect , screen play , directing , music and cinematography is very good . I enjoyed this one very much . I loved the way the diector presnt all the superhero characters . I love it .",
        "Action-packed, emotional with some laughs along the way of course! Thanos is the most powerful villain EVER! The team-ups are great and so is the banter of course! There's only one thing I was devastated about was...\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRIP LOKI :\"(",
        "This movie has its Disney tone to it, but is very scary at the same time and it the darkest Avengers to date and the best one so far. Brolin is very scary as Thanos and the rest of the cast is fantastic! Very heartwarming and heartbreaking film",
        "Absolutely incredible and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. There's a few minor things about it that one could pick a fight about, but that can be easily over-sighted by how much of a fun time you're having watching it unfold. Also to note, is we have finally strayed from the Marvel Movie formula, and it feels amazing. Brush up on your Marvel films, and then watch this bad boy with some popcorn to be entertained.",
        "A true epic event film. A non-stop thrill ride of superhero action with a great twist at the end. Also the first superhero movie I know of where the actual protagonist is the villain, and Josh Brolin's Thanos shines as he carries this movie to near perfection. The thrills hit hard and emotional moments hit harder. A GREAT movie.",
        "All the groundwork of the MCU previous films make this a great centerpiece with all the key elements of storytelling brought into play.",
        "Thor's story was good, the rest was the usual crappy stereotypes. Too much CGI, 3rd rate acting by most characters. Mindless entertainment, lots of eye candy, forgettable movie.",
        "Loved this movie! Kept me hooked and on the edge of my seat. Photography and special affects were masterfully done, acting was superb... my one disappointment was the ending. Just another ploy from Hollywood to milk movie goers out of more money. Instead of just doing a sequel they chose to bait and switch... even still, I had a good time at the movie. Not sure I will want to go back for the second part, loosing a bit of trust in Hollywood... very sad.",
        "I've just seen the greatest comic book movie ever made!!!! I'm not overhyping this film but that was breathtaking, beautiful, dramatic, deep, poetic, funny, emotional and action packed in ways I can't even describe. Believe the hype, the s**t just got real. Avengers: Infinity War stands head and shoulders above anything that's gone before it and yes, that includes DC. Perfection!!",
        "Just like the title, Avengers, Infinty War, Join all heroes for one but screen. Is good to see.",
        "A culmination of 18 movies,10 years and a ton of characters from the comics all lead to this. A spectacular visual marvel with a fast storytelling and good ol' comic book action. Thanos most definitely is the main protagonist of this movie and has been done justice in the hands of the Russos. A satisfying screen time for most and doses of unexpected events that would shock even the most veteran comic fans/movie goers. The boldest MCU movie by far and a proper comic book movie. Infinity war is not for the casual movie goers,its a love letter to all those who stayed for the last 10 years.",
        "The movie is very good, all the praise for the actors, and for everyone who made this movie, I like it a lot",
        "I absolutely loved this film....The way it starts is awesome. The action is incredible and almost unmatched by any other MCU film. The finale is a glory to behold as well. The cast does a great job...especially the \"new\" villain Thanos. He's the star here. Hes very very powerful...no spoilers here. The ending is heartbreaking and as good as a cliffhanger as i've seen since Star wars ESB. The thing is...i dont think this is toppable....this may be the apex of the MCU but hey we'll see in Avengers 4.",
        "Regardless of how long it took to film, its the best heromovie out there. Lots of action-packed scenes but also very real. Credits to the masters",
        "The best: Close virtually unbeatable for the ten years of the MCU, drink of the best of each Marvel saga. The way to bring all the protagonists together is sublime. The BSO and the CGI are the best that has been in the MCU to date. Unite with such elegance and naturalness the themes that are given in each of the films and none of them is out of place at any time. As for the CGI, what to say, one of Marvel's strengths since this universe began and once again does not disappoint. The brothers Russo direct and most importantly, they mount the film and that's where the difference between this film and a movie of the genre is noticed. The worst: The script has more holes than a \"Gruyere cheese\" they teach a lot and they count little, they leave all the answers for the announced Avengers 4. The times of the film are quite badly taken and the subplot of Thanos and Gamora are left over in the movie .",
        "Great action from start to finish. But I left the theater like \"WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!\" I'm not sure how I really feel about this. May take me awhile to watch again, if I decide to.",
        "Great movie, good to see all the superhero's in one film, the ending confused me, what's next?",
        "The build up of this movie to get to where it is at during it's time of release is just insane. From the 1st Iron Man Movie and all the following movies after such as Captain America, Spider-man home coming, Thor, and Avengers Infinity War to name a few. It took about 22 movies (I could be wrong) to get to this final one, the end of all end, to where a new phase will begin. It's insane but how they did, the way the did it, is just superb, not perfect, but better than most.\n\nThanks everyone behind this and please make sure Spider-man stays in the same universe! it's a must!",
        "This was well worth the 10 year wait. It more than satisfied me and pulled no punches. I commend the film makers for this massive undertaking.",
        "Been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty.",
        "Marvel's most ambitious title yet revels in it's frequently remarkable computer generated imagery. From the piercingly realistic Thanos to the glorious depiction of otherworldly planets, it's difficult not to succumb to awe and wonder. Additionally, the action sequences here are earnestly more successful than in the scandalously overrated Black Panther.\n\nHowever, it may be argued that the narrative's dark tone comes into conflict with the protagonists' humorous dialogue, dampening the atmosphere.\n\nDespite the positive reception to major antagonist Thanos, his depth amounts to little more than a somewhat contrived origin story.",
        "This for me is the best of all the Avengers movies. What makes it is the character of Thanos, he is not an out an out bad guy but somebody who sees what hes doing is for the good of the universe. Added to this is that he has strong feelings and compassion. End game just doesn't have this aspect. I think the ratings for this is right, for me the plot has a few flaws and some CGI is a little off but that's it, so close for a 10 for me. But unlike some great films you can watch this one a few times.",
        "This is what you waiting for all this years, great plot, one thing I would like to see diffrent, the black order they should be more powerful but that's a detail, Thanos is the best villan so far.",
        "Being a huge comic book fan for over 50 years, I would have given this movie a 10 out of 10 but for only the way they treated the character of the Hulk badly .Especially in the confrontation with Thanos at the begging of the movie. In my view Hulk was not shown anywhere near his past representations of what I know of the Hulk to be. I always believed that if you start a fist fight with him you will loose. He is known for getting stronger as he gets madder. Just look at the fight with the abomination in the Hulk movie. Which is part of the MCU Universe canon, that why I was very disappointed when they diminished his worth as the character to what I always knew him to be etc..Anyway I still very much enjoyed the movie.",
        "This was a very easy watch, it's non stop action which really helps you loose yourself in the world of cinema. That being said I left the theatre wondering what were they thinking, it had at least two major flaws in the plot which are huge and very noticeable. I think it gets 7* as it was very watchable and quite funny also the special effects were as usual flawless.",
        "Enjoyed this one, plenty of laughs, action and all your favourite characters. A few surprises at the end which sets up the next movie and has you wanting more. Another solid effort",
        "It is an Avenger superhero movie and it develops as it is to be expected. It's chaotic, relentless in its progression and there's just so much happening that's quite hard to take seriously half of it. Every scene has a new character, a new development, something unreasonable happening. There's just too much to be done for a single movie and as a consequence most of it is mediocre in its execution. On the other hand, it's entertaining in its action and combat scenes. Effects are great and the soundtrack fitting. The saving grace is the ending, maybe the only unexpected bit of the entire movie.",
        "The movie is actually 9/10+ Shawshank redemption and godfather/dark knight all of which are amazing movies due to the plot and storyline progression. Infinity War has so much more than that,AMAZING CGI,GREAT story/character progression,fast paced sequences,epic dialogue,funny moments,incredibly believeable fight sequences,the camera angles/quality everything is written and executed perfectly,this film is actually reached its potential and so much more. The movie could not have been done better and thats why it deserves a solid 8.7/9.2 IMO.",
        "This movie is a masterpiece and if you haven't seen it you are missing out on so much",
        "Wonderful from beginning to end. Can't wait for the next installment.",
        "The movie was good. The hopes and expectations might be fullfilled. But feel like the movie could've been bit longer, so it could not fall into the messy montage alignment. That was the bit of bitter tinge for me. Although the minus, the movie is a grand adventure. That's all from me.",
        "Wow! What a ride from start to finish, had me on the edge of my seat. I laughed and i cried, once it was finished i wanted more. Best Avengers movie so far. Loved seeing all my favourites in the same movie. Cant wait for more.",
        "I dont understand all the high reviews this movie was slow paced and boring I enjoyed percyjackson and the sea monster more than this movie.",
        "(Spoiler Free) What an ending! Great portrayal of Thanos! Not what I was expecting at all, this isn't a masterpiece",
        "The most anticipated movie of the year did not disappoint. The acting and cinematography blew me away. All characters where absolutely fantastic and Thanos is a great villain. Easily one of the best movies of the year. 9/10",
        "Then tell to Francis Ford Coppola that is enough to put in all the possible characters without thinking too much to their balance or to the story. But every age group, sex, race or religion has its superhero represented so everyone is happy.",
        "Acting-9/10 Script/Writing-10/10 Special Effects-10/10 Characters/Character Development-8/10 Plot-8/10 Cinematography-9/10\n\nOverall-9/10",
        "The movie is full of very well developed action scenes. It catches the viewer's attention from the very first moment and makes good use of the Avengers skills. However, it's full of gore and extreme violence. In many times I found my daughter looking behind or elsewhere from the violence scenes. What was totally affecting her overall satisfaction was also the ending of the movie and the message it might holds. I wish I was warned before entering the movie about the number of extreme killings in the movie. I would have sure picked another one to watch with my child. One last aspect, the movie seems incomplete to me and I am not in favor of such type of stories.",
        "Honestly,leave the hype aside but this doesn't feels like movie.The scenes are very small that leads to exhaustion from the audience point of view.Let the fanboys scream,but this is not a great movie but a mediocre one.this doesn't deserves a rating of 9.1 that puts it higher above the dark knight which is ridiculous.",
        "It's worth watching all the previous marvel films. I think they do a very good job managing the level of characters.",
        "Avengers infinity war is a very great film. Watched it in theatres when it was released ,had goosebumps it's one of thr great films i have seen in my life. The filmography and acting everything is cool and well made . Nothing disappointment but it doesn't deserve 10 stars cause not a masterpiece.",
        "Obviously since this is Thanos we're talking about here I knew the first part wouldn't be as much of a happy ending, but I never expected this. There was of course plenty of action packed scenes, comedic relief, and I was surprised with how well they were able to keep the story going while it was surrounded with SO many different characters. So yes, it was one of the most tragic things I've watched (because I grew up in marvel stuff) but it was such a good movie and I'm so ready for the finale!!!!",
        "Marvel did it again. Oh, that's not exactly a compliment. It's a critic of the MCU films, if anything. Why did I wrote that? Here's my reasons:\n\nHandle and manage to juggle many major characters\nInteresting villain (only recent few films)\nTypical move of dip-your-toe for a few minutes and then dips out again for the plot. It's really becoming MCU's staple of plot line development. What I meant here is just like Civil War and Black Panther, it tries to do the heavy stuff but then reverts to the same safe play move\nEverybody has one-liners.\nGood but not great. Just okay.",
        "People are saying \"wow best marvel movie yet\" I say wow worst marvel movie yet\" the plot was everywhere, it was way to long and nothing really happened the whole time. It was a complete waste of time. The romance and comedy were the best parts of the movie. The action was pretty good, but there was way to much backstory and no actual long intense battles. Some characters that looked like they were going to a big part in the movie were in it for like 2min. Overall it was a big let down because I had been waiting forever for this movie to come out and I was actually exited. My advice, save your money and wait until the infinity war 2 comes out. I swear you won't miss anything important.",
        "I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but from my point of view Infinity War is way better than Endgame. I do feel like Endgame tried to copy some great scenes from Infinity War, yet those ones were miserably executed. The only thing amazing about Endgame is Captain Marvel and her new short haircut, but that's about all that shines on Endgame :(. I am really disappointed, I really hoped for something better and not that predictable. Infinity War has a great trailer, but the movie itself is quite amazing, almost reaches perfection in this SF movie segment.",
        "I never give 10 stars but I can't stop thinking about this movie days after seeing it. All the story lines are brilliantly intertwined for all the varied superheroes and past movies. We were left devastated, but hopeful at the end of this one. I had to run out and rent Thor: Ragnorok the next day to help make sense of a few things. Glad I saw most of the others because it makes this film all the richer. I just need to see the Dr. Strange movie to get a totally complete picture, then you can be sure I will be watching Infinity War again! This movie pulls on just about every emotion and leaves us craving more story, more answers. Who will return and who will not. This is what it's all about. We are getting attached to every character, love them teaming together in fun, battle and in tragic times. They are each fantastic in their own way. I can't wait until May to see Part 2, and all the Marvel movies that are to come. Final note: Iron Spider MUST LIVE!",
        "No, I'm not the type of Marvel fans who appreciated blindly every movie they made. Believe me, you are not ready for this one. And if you saw it, you weren't prepared.\n\nWhat a movie ! I never thought they could erase the mistakes they made with Civil War but they do and the picture is what we want but nothing you can expect.\n\nCongrats Marvel Studios. 10 Years in the making has another meaning : excellence.",
        "Beautiful movie with a perfect plot and very well performed, really great special effects and never bore",
        "This movie lacks the magical Joss Whedon touch. The witty repartee just wasn't there. Thanos was supposed to be an ambivalent \"monster\", but seemed too melancholy and uncommitted to his choices. Joss is the master of bipolar multiple personality disorder villians and hero's alike. Some of the characters just weren't selling it.",
        "I dont know whether we have kids here or the PR agencies who have given this movie a 10/10, but this movie is certainly not a perfect 10, actually far from it. I dont want to complain about the plot, but right from the beginning the movie seems all over the place. We understand Thanos is after the infinity stones but the screenplay fails to deliver this story in a 'Marvel' way we are accustomed to enjoy. I really enjoyed Josh Brolin as the mighty 'Thanos\" - He is just perfect in this role and delivers a stellar performance. If you are an Avengers fan, definately see this movie but dont expect a grand finale, because this is definately not.",
        "How is this movie rated #51 of imdb all time? It's a terrible movie with the premises of obtaining stones to put on a glove to end the world. And the ending is silly as all other Marvel movies have been announced so it doesn't matter who survives and who doesn't. I didn't enjoy this movie. It's almost as if you're playing a video game or watching your friend play a game while you watch.",
        "Marvel quality stantards are high again! Good acting . A lot of fighting and sense of humor with a pro edit from the director. If you are a fan of superheroes movies this is your bible . You are gonna see them all ! The villan is good enought . What else to ask ;",
        "I just looked at it yesterday. There are a lot of impressions, some of them unexpected, but mostly positive. The first thing I would like to note is a really cool antihero, who is, in general, the main character of the picture. Second, the Avengers act in groups, not together. Even the picture from the screensaver on the poster is not a screenshot - one of the heroes was not in that location. Third, this is an unconventional, let's say, ending. And so, in principle, it's still the same cheerful Marvel, with a bunch of superheroes, battle scenes, jokes and jokes. By the way, I would like to say separately about the Black Panther. Everyone was scolding the Russian dubbing, but in the original his voice is just as dull, plus all the Wakandans speak with a terrible African accent - it all sounds terrible, it's good that a little. In theory, Infinity War should bypass the State of emergency in fees and become the highest-grossing film in history. Until the release of the second part, at least.",
        "Everything built up to this perfect end just right in every way. This whole duology should actually be 8 hours long (kidding...or am I?). Such magnificence and excellence in filmmaking should get every comic lovers full appreciation. Thank you Marvel, but as I promised my final rating will be after watching the final part, I have faith.",
        "I remember the day I went to the theater to see this movie, \"This will be bad, there's no way they can tell a compelling story in less than two and a half hours, there are too many characters to introduce to each other, not enough screen time to do that and continue the story,\" oh my God, how wrong I was! This movie is written by Anthony and Joe Russo, the script is fantastic, the pacing of the movie is good, and each character stays true to themselves, which shouldn't have been easy to do. This movie is a masterpiece.",
        "Like all the previous \"series\" of this film, everything was shot super, both graphics and plot, combining reality (our world, our time) with the world of fairy tales.\n\nActors are very cool for their roles, it's impossible to think of a better one, cute), charismatic, as if they always live by these characters.\n\nThis movie is suitable for absolutely everyone to watch! It will be interesting for both children and adults. This will probably be one of my favorites.\n\nI definitely advise you to watch it!",
        "Infinity war is not one single thing. It is not all great, but at it's best it is easily worth an 8. Some of the action scenes are mind blowing. Unfortunately it is unable to keep the greatness through the entire film. Maybe, when I have seen Endgame I would want to change the score.",
        "The is one of the best movies in the MCU line up, based purely on a storytelling and action. The villain(s) are great and the visuals are astounding. However on a personal level I lost a lot of enjoyment based solely on who was more of a main character than who. A lot of the characters I find annoying or boring had more time to do things in this movie than those I enjoy. Also Ebony Maw was dispatched too quickly. Movie loses its appeal the more time passes.\n\nPersonal Enjoyment Score (IMDb): 6/10 Movie Score (LetterBoxd): 7/10",
        "Ten years ago, in 2008, Marvel released the Iron Man blockbuster and ushered in a new era - the era of the grandiose comic book universe, which currently includes two dozen full-length films and many related projects. How is the studio celebrating its anniversary? With the help of her most epic blockbuster, which brings together almost all of her on-screen superheroes with an enemy of transcendental, universal power.\n\nThis is a very family film, without harsh humor, just for a pleasant viewing, without straining the brain.",
        "An uneven and ambiguous film that has both undeniable advantages and obvious disadvantages inherent in all Marvel crossovers. The advantages of the film include the colorful villain Thanos with finally clearly prescribed motivation, a lot of locations and special effects, the drama of individual scenes and the meeting of almost all the characters from the Marvel cinematic universe. Cons: a long, sometimes sagging plot with a bunch of logical holes, a very uneven distribution of characters, with well-defined individual characters (Thor) and completely lost in the film (Doctor Strange, Bucky), weak interaction between the characters, humor at the level of Petrosian's sketches and inarticulate musical arrangement. Overall, out of 19 Marvel films, he is somewhere in the middle. You can watch in IMAX, but don't expect too much from the prologue to Avengers 4.",
        "Besides the fact i really love this movie for the storyline i'm better than no man cause all the time i was checking out chris evans tbh. He do be hot.",
        "Amazing experience I watched it in theatre good story amazing action scenes.as it reads itself infinity war there is a war, the climax that keeps it pace and amazing ending that will shook you.",
        "Great Movies I Have Seen..This Movie Portays a Villain That by Far has Been The Best Out of All The Other Marvel Antagonist. The Ending really Makes a Mark On The Audience.",
        "Worth to watch. Enjoyed most. One of the best directed and one of the best from Marvel Cinematic Universe. Personally liked the 3-4 characters from this movie. Dr. Strange, Thanos, Iron Man, Spider Man. Also impressed that Thor entry scene at the Wakanda with his Hammer Punch.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is easily the best MCU movie of all time. Even with Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Infinity War stays on top.",
        "I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.\n\nAvengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way. It's genuinely a very strong movie, that is deeply rewatchable, and one of the best Space movies ever made.",
        "The crossover event invoke so much great feelings, mainly cause (unlike other studios) Marvel has done such an amazing job earning this emotions. All of these characters have been masterly built up and developed so we genuinely care when they're in danger and things don't work out right...",
        "This movie was a great addition to the MCU. I am a little disappointed there was very little Hulk in the movie. To see half of Earth's mightiest Heroes fall was great. The action scenes (especially on Wakanda) were well choreographed. We see a whole new side of Star Lord. It was great.",
        "The theater audience was so eclectic that first night I can appreciate the hype in every repeated viewing. This film manages to bring out emotion from the audience and I can't help but be caught up in it all. The pay-offs to a decade of character and story reaches its apex here. 4 years later I realized my time viewing every film prior to get to this point was validated by this movie.\n\nIn my eyes, cinema can be justified through different methods. Infinity War justifies itself by intentionally using hype built up from all that came before to elevate this story to an experience I rarely get from other types of film.",
        "I came into this movie ready to be disappointed because I heard all of the spoilers. I ended up being more disappointed than I ever could have expected. The movie is so over saturated that characters become useless to the \"plot\". I say \"plot\" because it's so paper thin that you can barely even call it a plot. Everyone in this movie seems to have been dumbed down to an incredibly low level. I felt my brain actually turning to goo due to the lack of sense in this film. I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this. Thank you local library. I give it a 4/10 only for the nice CGI and maybe 1 or 2 moderately funny jokes.",
        "This movie is big with so much going on. I applaud the directors and everyone involved in making this movie. Im no movie maker myself but i can only imagine how difficult a task this was to bring so many characters together and make it work but somehow they did. Heaps of action, drama and comedy and a villain that surprised me. Finally, the humour and chemistry between characters was great and Drax! For me, Drax again was the funniest! Stay tuned for the after credits......its pretty cool!",
        "A very well made film that somehow manages to keep order within all the chaos. Given such a large cast, the Russo Brothers managed to make the film feel smoother than a ton other films in the MCU and delivers the thrills and the chills that are beyond any other in the MCU. The cliffhanger is shocking and leaves us asking for more. Well, here's to another year of waiting.",
        "I watched Infinity War for the third time, and the first at home on my television. The impact was no less than in the theater. It is a sprawling epic, made contextually satisfying if you have seen the lead-up Marvel films going into it. The characters are familiar yet evolved. Tom Holland as the teenage Spider-Man is especially refreshing as both new hero and fanboy. But most attention goes to Josh Brolin's motion-captured Thanos, a villain who is formidable, but engaging; evil but charismatic. No punches are pulled in the finale of this installment, leaving most exhausted and introspective. It affects more than a comic book adaptation should. My personal wish is that this was the end - no more sequels - as what a story it would be.",
        "A delightfully nerdy mash-up that is a kitchen sink of genres. It had all the major players in the MCU to date, but they were still able to balance things out and avoid it feeling too busy / crowded. Incorporated themes that cut across time, space, death, and reality. The story kept me on the edge of my seat right up until the end. Not since 'Wrath of Khan' has a movie left me with a feeling of \"Holy crap, what are they going to do next!\" Must-see.",
        "Waw what a great movie. Story is maybe not extremely elaborated but the special fx definitely are, without being \"over the top\" (like Transformers for instance). The only (very little) negative thing I found was the action scenes that were moving so fast that you couldn't see all the details of the shots. Just like there was too much blur on the images and you missed some things. But this is pure nagging, as said in my first sentence: stunning movie, very big recommendation.",
        "I'm almost wordless, and.....LOTR is my no.1 movie of all-time, and Avengers: Infinity War is another LOTR to me, still I love LOTR better, but it's just because LOTR filled with great motivational messages, this is the only difference, put aside this IW = LOTR, or maybe even better than LOTR.\n\nHats off... Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War",
        "Saw it with my family, we all loved it. Very funny, and a great cliff hanger.....",
        "This movie was an overrated summer blockbuster. There was no substance what so ever.\n\nThis was supposed to be the climactic end of the saga but instead I'm typical marvel fashion they end on a cliff hanger.\n\nOf course they're just going to keep pumping out garbage so long as all the people who gave this a 10 and raved about and and continue paying to watch the same movie over and over",
        "Remember it's fast, does not have time for crap scenes, everyone is lucky to get a line. Hard to catch on for non MCU guys but I gotta say Awesome.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is one of the world's best movies all time. I strongly like the movie because it have many superheroes working together as a team to go against Thanos, even though the heroes failed and Thanos succeed.",
        "It is a must see film that keeps you gripped through out there is not much else that is needed to be said about this film just go see it",
        "Best marvel movie yet. Came in with low expectations as they were so high in the media. This movie had everything with very little timeout moments. Well done marvel the first marvel movie I Couldn't fault. Entertainment galore!",
        "I was excited when i have seen fake 8.6 IMDB score of a movie.\n\nso i sat down and started watching.\n\ni was surprised how good was the graphics , but this thig that they call \"MOVIE\" is filming a green screen. you don't call filming a green screen a movie. this film had nothing to offer other than green screen effects. for 12 year old kids - this movie will be good.\n\nGod oh god how i was surprised when this 90% of green screen filming thing was rated above movies like \"Interstellar\" or \"saving private Ryan\"\n\nwhat is wrong with this world?",
        "Excellent from beginning to end. Gave us not the evening we wanted but the ending we needed. Definitely a must see, simply put.",
        "The Best Greatest MCU Film Ever!!! Iron Man, Thor, Black Window, Scarlet Witch, Okoye, Thanos, Dr. Strange, Guardians of The Galaxy, Spider-Man, Captain America, Bruce, War Machine, Falcon, Black Panther and the rest were great awesome.",
        "IF HAWKEYE WAS THERE WOULDV'E ENDED THE MOVIE REAL QUICK. HE WOULD'VE GONE FOR THE HEAD!!1111!!!!",
        "Avengers Infinity War is a 140-minute tornado that comes in and goes out punching with the intent to kill. It requires several viewings just to comprehend all the material this film contains. Its strengths are in its ludicrously intense levels of action and mayhem, as well as a great performance from Josh Brolin, who finally brings to life the most well-developed MCU villain to date. Weaknesses? Some pretty hard-to-ignore plot holes and an ending that fails to evoke the emotion in the way it so enthusiastically tries to. Final Remarks? Avengers: Infinity War is for anyone looking for an explosive, edge-of-your-seat adventure, but those seeking a richer and deeper emotional resonance will gravitate towards Endgame.",
        "It was a nice adventure, very interesting that all heroes came together, never happened before in a masive scale like this but.. This movie never ended.. Its a movie 2 and a half hours without ending, its like a part 1.. Happy that i can see the next right away, but if i watched it in the movies i would be very annoyed.",
        "This the same marvel flick we always enjoy , yet personally it's the best one yet because of the suprises it packs.\n\nThis is most possibly the most darkest film in the Marvel Universe yet. It marks the start of the new era of marvel cinema , and possibly every Marvel movie you will see from now will be much darker and wilder.\n\nThere is everything in thid movie :Drama , Aomedy , Action , SciFi , Thriller , Adventure , Romance , an ending that will twist your mind. If you've heard that the ending is bad , that's because it slightly is , but the next avenger will only give true Justice to this ending.\n\n8/10 if you've never seen any Marvel movie before",
        "No spoilers. Only the truest of Marvel haters or incompetent reviewers would give this movie anything less than a 8. Everything you could want in a superhero film. The baddest heroes vs the absolute baddest villain. Need I say more?? Watch it and be amazed..... This movie was a true spectacle and brought out tons of varying emotions in viewers. The theatre I went to was packed and every one in their loved it! Everyone!",
        "I as a fan I would give it a 10 But as a critic I give it a 9 It has the emotional effect after all this years of the MCU Story is perfect. The antagonist is perfect. Finally we have an end But just the half of it Cause we have to wait for the second part in 2019",
        "Was as funny as any Marvel movie but definitely not funnier. I choked up more during this than during any other Marvel movie. Higher stakes and loss equals more emotion. Tons of action. Cliffhanger at the end leaves you wondering what's next. Best villain of any Marvel movie, by far. I still feel like there were some missed opportunities, but the job the Russos did of juggling this many characters and keeping it this good is quite a feat.",
        "This was a high octane superhero film, and it was done beautifully and exceptionally well - and that's knowing the multitude of characters and storylines that had to be woven into this beast of an undertaking.\n\nAs always, the Russo brothers and the cast and geniuses working behind the scenes delivered.\n\nThey delivered something exceptionally human, and fantastically impossible.\n\nWatch it if you haven't already. Watch it again if you have. There's so much packed into every millisecond.",
        "Manages to work in the previous 18 MCU movies into a fairly cohesive enterprise. Funny yet sad. Action packed , yet, reflective. Seems like both an ending and a beginning.",
        "Beautifull storytelling,great pace,great vilain which you can sympathize and understand,everything on this movie is near perfect,interactions with out loved heroes are perfectly done,the comedy in this movie is HILARIOUS,naturaly done and not forced.This is the darkest and most brutal Marvel film to date. A RECOMMENDED for Marvel comic book fans,non comic book fans and fans of great superhero films like the Dark knight.",
        "2.29 hrs are simply wasted. i dont know why some people telling lies about that crap , and try to proving that its an awesome movie... iam just talking to those people who planning to watch avengers infinty war, save your 2.29 hrs and spend them some other good things.. dont waste your 2.29 hrs on that crap...",
        "Always love Russo brothers' films and Avengers series. now they both combine to one so makes me expectable! the box office proved I and Marvel supervisors were correct. Russo brothers made every super heroes play their roles well and his/her power isn't a far cry from another, at least looks like. and the box office is no.1 in Marvel.",
        "A.k.a. Chris Hemsworth the 'actor' who will say yes to anything and everything because if he misses any gig then he may be exposed as the no-talent hack that he is. OK, yes, let us take a moment to apologize to all the no-talent hacks out there we just insulted.\n\nAs for this so-called Infinity War (actually not a bad title... the film is 2 hours too long): Stupid movie\n\nSuch a stupid unrealistic action moviea, just brainless, cant understand why there are so popular, just crazy. Nice profits tough ...",
        "Just left opening night. Saw it in IMAX and well worth it. This movie has enough of everything to keep you entertained. What a real movie is supposed to do. NO POLITICS. JUST ENTERTAINMENT. Great cast. Great story. Great effects!!! Not what you think and not exactly what you expect. I've watched every marvel movie going back to the old ones. This one really will be very difficult to top. Loved it.",
        "So tired of women playing 2nd fiddle and weaker parts in the Marvel universe. Disney got it right with Moana & Frozen... why can't they figure out female superheroes. So bored with all of the avengers if women aren't the main stars. Thank goodness for DC's Wonder Woman.",
        "Go to the cinema to see the action special effects are all great. I personally think it's pretty good, the scene when all the heroes came out together is very shocking, and there are tears in the middle.",
        "Thanos was incredible throughout and so impressed with how they managed to advance so many character arcs in this movie for the MCU moving forward. Thor with the guardians was so well done and something I would love to see more of. Who knew Thor would be the funniest Avenger??",
        "Avengers Infinity Wars is an excellent movie. Very well done in every way. I saw this in the theaters, and the one complaint I have is that it was hard to watch. In the opening scene, we see the ever powerful Thanos trying to get the Space Stone, while the Hulk, Thor and Loki try to stop him. They can't and so he retrieves the stone and begins his quest for the rest of the Infinity Stones. What follows it seems, is the Avengers pulling out all of the stops, trying to defeat Thanos and fighting a losing battle. Very cool, but hard to watch. Not sure, if I'll see it again. If by chance, you're one of the few people who haven't seen it, I won't give away the ending. The good news is that Captain Marvel has joined the Avengers. I'll have to see Endgame!",
        "The movie has a fair share of funny and great moments, however there were plenty of scenes that were plain stupid. The writing was fine. The acting was generally just ok, nothing special. the action scenes and cg were also decent but it was nothing really new or stylistic. I also found the plot and some of the motivations/ decisions made by characters to be stupid, but that's just a personal thing. Overall it was just a mix of good and bad, but with the bad slightly outweighing the good. therefore making it just below average for me. If I could, i would rate it a 4.5/10.\n\nAlso I feel like i should add, despite me not really enjoying the film, i can see why others did. This movie and if you enjoy it really comes down to the person watching it.",
        "Did you like that catchy title? I just came up with it, and it's the opposite of what I thought this movie was. Never was I bored. Never was I without likeable characters. Never was I without good CGI (which is literally the entire point of any sci-fi/fantasy film.\n\nOverall, great. Worth the buy in 4K.",
        "After watching trailers promos u will be at peak stage of hype for this movie but after watching i found this movie as a over hyped movie with more expectations this film doesn't contain quality it is usual marvel movie which focuses on entertainment than an epic storytelling like dc",
        "Let me start off by saying I am a SciFi/Fantasy Fan, I love it.. it expands the mind and usually lifts the soul. But this negative soul ripping ride into depression made me so angry that I called where I buy digital movies from and got my money back.. first time I've ever done that.. I understand this is part one of a multi part movie, but *explative* after a hard day I wanted to be 'entertained' not pulled into a depression.. negative from start to finish, nothing but bad feelings. Superhero's are supposed to give hope and you'll find NONE here. In this day and time we live in the entire point of watching a superhero movie to see what a super hero is supposed to do. This movie infuriated me because it did the opposite.. you blew it marvel.. not as mad since I got to see it for free, but angry enough that I won't ever give you a red cent of mine again so long as I live for doing that to me.. you failed me at a time when I wanted nothing but a little entertainment, if I want something depressing that looks like fantasy I just watch the news. Marvel you suck.",
        "There is a troll movement trying to persuade people away from it. Best ensemble superhero movie ever made. Ever.",
        "Infinity War was hyped up to be an incredible spectacle, but although there were some incredible moments, especially with most one-liners being absolutely on point, some parts feel unnecessary; some drag on somewhat (Vision is a boring chap); and the whole film, especially the start, feels overtly Star Wars-y, which really confuses the viewing experience of a Marvel film, and leaves it overall as acceptably good, but not great.",
        "Wow this was very traumatising I can't wait to watch it 15 more times",
        "A cinematic crossover event unprecedented in its action, humor and melodrama, \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is an ambitious addition to the MCU in the same way \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980) or \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1\" (2010) were for their own series. The film somehow manages to coherently smash together a multitude of heroes and produce compelling, non-stop entertainment with high emotional stakes. There are minor frustrations with some characters needing more screen time, but \"Avengers: Infinity War\" accomplishes its goals as the first entry in an epic two-part installment. 9/10 or A-",
        "Fantastic cliff hanger. Good build up of tragedy and hope. I cannot wait for the next story",
        "This movie is perfect. All of Marvel's favorites coming together to fight the biggest threat the universe ever faced. There are a lot surprises throughout the movie especially the ending. I'm dying to see how Marvel wraps up the Avengers sequel in the next movies.",
        "Arguably best marvel movie so far! you dont have to worried about marvel movies who have been known to be too light and have too many scenes that break the moment or too many not well timed jokes or unfunny jokes etc. it have jokes in it but its just the right amount not too many and IT IS funny i mean like real funny. and it can make you hold your breath for almost from the start to the end of the movie. it have a lot of suspenseful moments. and there's one post credit scene YOU DONT WANNA MISS! luckily i didnt know what the post credit scene was until i saw it myself at the theatre and i just smile outside but was screaming inside like a little child when i finally saw it. man im gonna watch it for the second time and im still as enthusiastic as i was before i watched the movie for the first time.\n\np.s pardon my bad english ;D",
        "Could not sit through the movie. What a waste of time.",
        "Another one film that touch the epic zone from Marvel. Infinity war has a superstar cast and for sure the producers has a very difficult job to do, because its not easy to fit all these characters in one movie. And the result its almost impressive.The film has also one of the most awesome villain, good action and humor. The ending was a bit ambiguous, but all the questions we have will get answer at the next avengers movie so, we are waiting!",
        "This movie is one of the best in a decade. Marvel started something magical and hyped it up to this point and did not disapoint. I read some reviews about the holes in the plot and et cetera and all i wanted to say was wtf are you talking about. These people probably didn't even watch a single marvel movie let alone a mcu movie. Let me tell you this: this movie has a plot as long as 18 movies. It's all scattered around the mcu movies. Seein the thing we have been expecting for a decade was the reward. Infinity War is great as a standalone movie but it's rewarding and more sensible if you watch other mcu movies. It's funny, action packed, emotional and heroic. It makes sometimes makes you cry out of laughing and sometimes out of sadness. I suggest you watch other mcu movies before seeing this movie and you will hype like a dog who has seen his owner ;).",
        "It's not as good as Thor: Ragnarok or Captain America: Civil War, but it's better than the last Avengers film. If you haven't experienced Marvel fatigue yet then go see it. You better be caught up on your Marvel films though or you'll be seriously lost with half of what is going on.",
        "A truly masterpierce! Everything in this movie is epic,incredible,emotional.",
        "Marvel never fails at creating action-packed films. I was never bored throughout the movie. I am a sucker for good superhero action, so I found this very enjoyable. However, this is only nice if you don't over think it. Once you start analyzing the film and each individual character, things get confusing. You can see for yourself, but as a fan of many Marvel superheroes, I was kind of disappointed at how some of them were portrayed (you'll see what I mean). I feel like Marvel made this film plot only regarding the end goal, hence they manipulated and portrayed many characters oddly (and incorrectly) just to reach that end goal. This whole film felt like the set up for the sequel. The film had an overly simple plot and seemed set up just to give background for the upcoming sequel. MY RECOMMENDATION is to wait until the sequel is out, and then watch the two movies successively. I think that would be the most satisfying. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the action. Viewing this film without overanalysing it would leave you pretty satisfied.",
        "Infinity War is a jam packed movie with tons of action and story balanced for a nonstop Marvel experience like never seen before. Infinity War managed to cram a solid story, countless characters meshing together, and fun action all in one film that should have been 4 hours long to fit everything in. Seeing the Guardians finally interact with Avengers characters is one of the most satisfying elements of Infinity War. My only flaw WOULD BE that soooo much is jammed into this film. However, the Russo brothers managed to pull it off as effectively as anyone could. The Jam packed film worked and didn't feel like \"too much\" as much as it would if anyone else had Done a film like this. Loved it, go see this!",
        "This movie is a movie that brings in many emotions and is worth watching, as I have seen it twice myself.\n\nDefinitely worth the watch, especially if you're a veteran of the Marvel series.",
        "New and fresh, extremely ambitious and yet still familiar, the final act is absolutly insane! And you will remain on edge for hours after the credits roll, Here The Russo brothers have managed to blend the typical Marvel movie with an Oscar worthy experience of a lifetime",
        "From the opening moments to the last frame of the end credits scene, Avengers: Infinity War will blow you away. After ten years of films leading up to this moment, we finally get to see Thanos in action and he does not let down. Played by Josh Brolin, Thanos is above and beyond the best villain that the MCU has had to date. And when you get to the end of the film, you will be picking your jaw up off the floor as you will be craving more. And more we will get next year as Avengers 4 will be released.\n\nI highly recommend this film to all sci-fi, comic book movie, comedy and action fans out there. This highly lives up to the hype and deserves its spot as the #1 top grossing film of all time.",
        "I want to become thanos to eliminate half of humans in this world..",
        "10 years ago since there is the marvel cinematographic universe and 6 years ago we saw for the first time this great team of heroes who fight the battles that ordinary humans can not fight and today they achieved it with all the palmas, the movie directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, it is spectacular, a visual and innovative delight that surely many generations will one day see with affection, there is not a single minute that you are not stuck to the screen looking at everything, something that spielberg made us do recently with ready player one, and that is really a very good movie that has drama, action, comedy but its balance makes it sensational and everything I could say about history, about characters, about who is the best actor serious spoiler and it is something that as an spectator you would not be able to do, but in spite of these compliments if you have your problems, maybe, without a doubt it is something that you can not miss and that you will enjoy a lot, it is very enida, very enjoyable but it is not epic ... but it was close",
        "The movie was very nice the build up was amazing I mean 19 movies to make this movie most characters got a fair screen time except thanos of course but every character you know their back story you feel like you know them and you can't judge this movie alone because it's a two parts , to have all this story in just one part is very beautiful , this is my favorite super hero movie so far , most people who like DC more than marvel will say the movie is bad because this is not their team but just watch the movie and forget about DC or any other super hero movie and you will see it's a good one and for maximum enjoyment of this movie I prefer watching the movies before this that lead to this big movie. Also if you don't like super heros at all or if your very old you might not like this movie other wise you will love it just keep an open mind and try to blend in.",
        "After watching countless super hero movies and older avengers tv series's I was worried that the movie won't have any surprises left to give us. The writers did an amazing job giving us new material and a tremendous job bringing such a large and diverse set of superheroes together in an organic way that works well. Kudos to the whole Avengers team !",
        "The cliffhanger ending really annoyed me, The action and CGI was interesting but this movie is nowhere near the best movie of all time as many rate it to be so. I was actually disappointed after watching it, thinking to myself, that THIS is what everyone is raving about???",
        "I gotta say hands down on from beginning to end of this movie. If you haven't seen this movie I suggest to take yourself and a friend, girlfriend, family, or all and treat yourself to some popcorn, drinks, and candy to the best MCU movie that's out now.",

        "The whole Marvel Movie train from Iron Man through Avengers Infinity War leaves you speechless after this one. Incredible that these movies could all lend to each other without taking away from one another or the characters but continue to build into an Epic showdown.\n\nI can't think of another series of movies with such an assortment of complex characters that has done this so flawlessly. George Lucas could learn a thing or two from Marvel.\n\n10/10 and echoing the comments of another review \"The Best Super Hero Movie Ever Made!\" Perhaps the best Action/Sci-Fi movie ever made at that...\n\nIf you haven't been watching then go back start with Iron Man (2008) and watch this series... binge it, then go see Avenger Infinity War as you won't be disappointed.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War could just be the greatest marvel movie.... oh wait..... it is!! This movie is bone chilling and ground breaking. The action, characters, score, visual effects are all amazing! And Thanos, oh boy Thanos. He is the best marvel villain without a doubt. He is complex and sorta makes you emphasize with him. Josh Brolin does an amazing job adapting the character. He even cry's! And that's motion capture. The standout is Robert Downey Junior though. Best Iron Man performance. You know what, everyone is great. The ending will 100% make you cry and is breathtaking!! 10/10!!!!",
        "Brilliant movie! One of the best superhero movies ever! Really emotional and touchy! The plot is great as well as the effects! The end is just breathtaking!",
        "After watching endgame it all makes sense. I came here to rerate the movie to 10.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is hands down the BEST ensemble superhero movie ever made. The story in it is great. The settings goes perfectly well with the plot, and the ensemble cast were all amazing. It was beyond my expectations! I don't know what to say next, but thank you to the cast and crew for putting your blood, sweat and tears into this amazing movie. I am shocked and amazed by the way it ended but I promise not to spoil it for you guys because this is a spoiler-free review. I cannot wait for the next Marvel movies (such as Ant Man and the Wasp, Captain Marvel and the culminated Avengers 4).",

        "Avengers: Infinity War\n\nTen years in the making and it was worth it!\n\nAn emotional roller coaster , Beyond some of the best fight sequences ever shooted, from the execution to visual perfection, the interaction between characters are phenomenal. The Post Credit Scene is great . #CaptainMarvel",
        "The fanatics are out in force. This is a really good movie. This is not a 9.1. I would expect to see the user rating for this one at upper 7 lower 8. I gave it an 8. Dont get me wrong, they did a great job of coordinating a complex story with so many different components all coming together that really should have been a mess. And as far as the movie being too long, I didnt feel that while watching it. I was surprised when I looked at the time after. I dont know that someone could watch this without being familiar with the backstory of several previous movies and enjoy it as much.",
        "This is a big movie, a really big movie. Pretty much every Marvel character in the universe pulled in to a giant, drawn out fight for the fate of the universe. The production values are of course excellent but somehow I just felt it was a bit overwhelming, another fight, another explosion, another Marvel character, by the time it finally finished I was a bit beyond caring. It would have made a clever final chapter for the avengers but suprise, suprise I see there is another Avengers movie coming next year so I guess it is really just another super-hero movie.",
        "To be honest, with 10 years worth of movies backing this movie, it makes it hard for newcomers if this was your first movie, but the Russos did an amazing job on this movie \"yes it works!\" Amazing color, actors, story(though doesn't follow the Infinity Gauntlet comics at all), design, BGM. Every scene in this movie screams \"epic\" ! Nuff said. Pretty sure everyone has seen it by now...",
        "I never write reviews, ever! And I've never been an avid superhero fan, but this is something else. It has everything you could ever want from a film. It is a hell of 2 hour ride with so many emotions. I won't say anything about the plot as would hate to spoil it for anyone. If you only see one film at the cinema this year, then make sure it's this!",
        "Sorry, but it was. To me it seemed some evil villain surgically removed most of the characters' humour (they try, sometimes it works, but often it comes out just strained) and replaced it with pompousness and ostentatious sentimentality. The story is pushed onwards with obvious effort, scenes pile up with an obvious primary intention to impress and move, gone is the joy, fun and ease of the first Avengers. It looked a little like Marvel was trying to give birth to a DC movie and the labour was hard indeed.",
        "Go into this movie knowing as little as possible. There are a ton of surprises that I wasn't expecting. That fact that there have been 30 superhero movies in the past 10 years and this movie still manages to surprise me is a testament to how good this movie is. This is definitely my favorite MCU movie now. With Civil War being my number 2.",
        "I don't want to go too much into detail with my review of this film, only that it is incredible and that you need to go and see this film before some inconsiderate A-hole spoils it for you!\n\nThis film was everything I wanted and more, all I can say is, bring on avengers 4!!!",
        "This movie outdoes all expectations. It perfectly gives you all the different feels of the marvel cinematic universe within one movie. Balances humor, action, drama, suspense, and wonderfully adds surprise as well. To fully understand and experience the 10/10 rating I give it, you MUST watch all the movies. This will help you understand what led up to this, and have the feeling towards each character within the movie. Simply one of the best movies this generation will see.",
        "This is a great movie. Entertaining to the max with absolutely stunning action scenes. Amazing emotional ending that leaves you breathless.",
        "It seems to be a rule that Marvel movies are at their weakest the more superheroes are thrown in at once...which is confirmed by any new, pumped up Avengers movie that is weaker than it's predecessor...this was really hard to watch through...guess I'll skip Endgame because nothing good can come out of it...",
        "Definitely a lot of action in this movie a lot of fight scenes going on in 3 different places really liked it",
        "The Russo brothers pulled off one of the biggest movies of all time. Running around 2 1/2 hours it's a movie that only feels like an hour long with countless characters it lets all of them have a moment to shine...I came into this movie expecting so much and I still came out with exceeding expectations. A job well done to the Russo Brothers and I can't wait to see Avenegers Endgame...they believe it'll top this...but I don't know how they could",
        "Because nothing else in this movie makes sense. Purple dude looks for rocks and tries to be scary. Things happen. Heroes change all the rules around about what powers they have and why. More things happen. Oh yeah, spider man can survive in space without oxygen. Bunch of guys fight purple dude instead of going to the other side of the galaxy and hiding. Some stuff happens. Purple guy is sad. Random generic battle at the end with an extremely random army of space dogs that lasts way to long because the earth guys are incompetent. Some more dudes fight purple guy and should have no chance at killing him but somehow don't die instantly. Ending is pretty cool. Kansas would be proud. Also Tyrion Lannister just shows up for no reason.",
        "This big movie franchise has captivated the attention of audiences world over. Been a fan of the series since the 1st Avengers movie. But was not fan of the 2015 movie Avengers: Age of Ultron as it was a regular charade of fighting of big bad villains.\n\nThis movie was quite different experience then its prequel. The big cast line up is amazing. Story was bit stretched in certain parts but at normal space mostly. Non-stop back to back plots keeps the interest in the movie.\n\nFate of most characters don't look good but the sequel will reveal the what really happened to them. :P Overall a good action movie for this summer.",
        "Everything was really unexpected fun and sadness and we are waiting for the next movie i cannot describe how it was and i hope the next movie could be better",
        "Its rated 8.8 they should put it in top 15 Not 20 . Marval very good company for movies",
        "...so good!\n\nWoW! This movie was good! Very good, to say the least. I sat there in the theatre, chained tro mey seat because it was so very entertaining and exciting. I can safly say that this is the best marvel movie to date! I'm even inclined to say that its better than \"The Guardians\" movies which where my favourites till today. 10/10!\n\nGo watch it, but make sure you watch the other marvel movies from disney before you seee this one, because you might not get what is going on all the time. I recently rewatched all the MCU movies and I must say It helped greatly. There were a lot of people in the theatre who said things like: \"Who was this guy again\" \"Why was he there\" This is the only negative thing I have to say about Infinity war. It might get confusing if you have not senn the other movies. But other than that! Awesome!",
        "I gotta say I wasn't expecting this movie to be so good, but when I was in the theater watching the movie it had me on the edge of my seat. I didn't even worry about what time it was because I was so into the movie. I highly recommend this movie for all the Marvel fans .",
        "Guys this is average movie at its best with pointless or cringeworthy scenes cheesey at times. ScreenRant channel of youtuhe has reviewed it in the best way possible. It feels like 80's melodrama at times and jokes are lame made only on character names. Instead of going smart way they go dumbest way possoble to kill Thanos. I urge viewers to be smart otherwise they are going to shovel the same shit down your throat again!",
        "While I am a fan of comics I never was of its cinematic counterpart because almost always movie producdion houses and directors were not brave enough to adapt the movies like they were in the comics or close nough, in fear of not capturing the attention of the normal movie going masses. These last 16 movies by marvel decided to take a brave step in the right direction and expand on the comic universe in order to adapt some of the amazing and complex story lines from the comics. All 16 movies prior infonity wars led to the Infinity gauntlet event and slowly built up the plot for it in the backround of each movie. And finally with Avangers: Infinity War one of the most iconic battles in the marvel universe was fantastically adapted on the big screen. Avengers: Infinity War is the best movie of its genre, and the best comic adaption along with The Watchmen. I urge every Comic fan to watch this movie and be absolutely blown away. It blew all my expectations trough the roof!",
        "This is an amazing movie that made the 10 year wait pay off. It is the best Disney side of marvel movie of all time.",
        "Ok, so nobody will ever read this, and in all probability, it'll just be lost among the crowd of reviews, but it's worth a chance, right?\n\nThis is great. Pure gold. The best thing of 2018, followed by Ant-Man and the Wasp. Never got bored, not even once. You just have to love it. Don't listen to the haters, they have no taste whatsoever.",
        "Where do I even begin? Avengers Infinity War is one of the best if not THE BEST Marvel movie that I have ever seen. Everything in this movie was excellent from the acting and action to the special effects and music. Josh Brolin nailed his performance as Thanos and gives one of the best supervillain portrayals.",
        "Wow! End to end, not a second can be missed. Incredible. I love this movie it has everything from superhero's, action, comedy and darkens. What an ending, never seen an ending like this in a marvel movie.",
        "I cannot emphasise how good this movie is. It's ridiculously brilliant. The plotting, pace, script, acting, FX. The screen time given to each, of what must be the biggest ensemble of A List stars ever, is nothing short of miraculous. The film is above and beyond the usual superhero fare, the villain, Thanos, is expertly envisioned, played and brought to life by Josh Brolin and is quite possibly the best movie villain ever. As you can imagine, I am biased. I obviously love the genre but that's irrelevant. Before this movie came along, the 1933 version of King Kong was my favourite movie. It may still be when the Marvel Cinematic Universe runs its course but this movie, at the moment, is at No 1. How on earth can Avengers: Endgame top it?",
        "I'm 100% sure that all those negative reviews are from people who didnt even watch the movie or even worse from DC fans who hate marvel!!! That's by far the best movie in the last couple of decades in terms of everything the movie industry could offer So please ignorant reviewers be fair or dont write anything better Thanks marvel for such an amazing 10 years",
        "It's been a long time since I've seen a film that kept me in suspense. The Russo Brothers are good at their jobs. The film has a steady, fun pacing for the most part, but it's the balance of having all these different characters meeting, their dialogue, and working together that really made the movie shine.",
        "There was good action throughout this movie starting just a few minutes in and some moments of pretty funny humor. There were also a few obviously stupid choices by the characters that were obviously done that way so they could drag out the story to infinity and beyond. One was with Star Lord and another stupid choice was made by Thor. I won't say what they were but if you see the movie you will know. Anyway, I was a little disappointed in the movie overall. Hopefully the sequel is better. Hopefully there is only one sequel and they don't drag it out for 3 or 4 movies.",
        "Considering the fact that this is a SUPERHERO movie, it has the first ending that, actually makes a lot of sense. I don't understand what this movie was missing or what it had too much of to give it such bad ratings from the fans - some being HUGE marvel fans, yet hated the movie (Like one of my friends). All the ratings are 10s or 9s or 1s or 2s. C'mon, my marvel-fan friends, encourage the damn film so that Avengers 4 will be the best amongst all the films! Let's make the next movie worth an 11!!!",
        "This movie was really great,Better pacing and a great villain. Perfect standalone movie and highly enjoyable even for a casual fan. I loved it.",
        "WHAT CAN I SAY BUT WOW ABSOLUTELY AWESOME NOT BEEN MUCH OF A FAN OF THE PREVIOUS ONES BUT THIS IS ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL COMPLETELY ALL OTHER MARVEL FILMS I LOVE BUT THEM BEING TOGTHER I WASNT SO IMPRESSED WITH BUT NOW THIS LATEST : )",
        "The production and direction unit very easily justifies all the marvel characters in this movie. The movie proves that a story of multiple and unavoidable characters can be told and visualized in mere 160 Minutes. KUDOS!!! The balance of characters and events are done with great precision and timing. Sadly, I never get to see HULK in his SMASH mode. Hope the next/Final part will have hulk in full SMASH mode kicking Thanos!!!",
        "This film is just as Good as Civil War. I'm deeply impressed as to how the movie stood very well with the overstuffung of many characters and making every single one of them play a part in this fantastic superhero brawl and mashup! There are little to no subplots, only one goal. This movie did much justice to captivate a true superhero film with your favorites and not so favorites with an impressive villain with a true purpose to stop at nothing until he gets what he wants. One of the top five best films of all time HANDS DOWN! No spoilers, expect the best, and the worst.",
        "This film seems like aggregation of Marvel movie experience. It has large budget, cool effects, nice costumes, good actors, funny humor. Still same as other Marvel creatures, it's completely empty regarding it's script. No logical decisions from characters, most of the time it feels like they are completely stupid. Each 3-4 min I facepalmed after some scene. It was pretty painful to watch it. Is it so hard to spend more money on story and kick ass of those, who create stupid episodes?",
        "The most hyped movie, and simultaneously the most justifyingly hyped movie of the year, it has the power to bring emotions out of nothing. The last decade has been revolutionary for the superhero movie genre with the release of movies like dark knight trilogy. While marvel had been unable to create an engagingly emotional connect",
        "I am utterly speechless and this doesn't happen often, seldom even.\n\nJosh Brolin owns as Thanos and he dethrones Killmonger as the best villain in MCU. His dialogue and motivations are masterclass writing.\n\nThe stakes have never been higher and there are scenes, that will send chills down your spine throughout the movie. There are so many sub plots, that it's hard to keep track of what's everyone doing, nevertheless the Russo brothers succeeded in that. No shaky cam, breathtaking action, amazing CGI - Beautiful viewing experience. This isn't a movie, it's an experience that will leave you wondering about the sequel.",
        "As a fan of this franchise, I'm still in shock from this movie. The super heros, vilians, and all the strange creatures have finally meet their faith, in the form of the toughest sob to ever appear in any of the related movies. It doesn't matter who you adore, Thor, Captian America, Hulk, Black Panther, Spider Man, or even Groot - they are all here. And it's not easy. What I loved in this movie is the amount of shocking scenes, and the twists. Excellent plot, script, directing, animation & effects. This movie is a must watch.",
        "One of the best superhero films I've watched !! Soooo recommended !!!",
        "Some of the acting is terrible. Ruffolo is way out of his league, while others were fantastic.",
        "Could've been a bloated mess but the Russo brothers juggle the huge cast well (although a few characters felt underused). The characterisation of Thanos really underpins the whole thing though - a rounded and well written villain for once.\n\nSome more character beats for the main cast would have been nice but that would probably have extended the run time to 3 hours plus - which would have been fine with me.\n\nBrilliant fun",
        "Nonsense and boring movie. I can't waste time writing this.",
        "This movie blew my mind! I can't believe anything that happened and yet I do believe everything. Although this movie had me distraught, I think it is one of the best Marvel movies ever made! I highly recommend this even to people who don't like these movie because you will just be blown away",
        "Woohoo!!! As expected!! No words to say. Really...all I can say OMG..Every part of the sequence of events was mind-blowing!\n\nUpdated! Updated! I watched it a second time!! OMG! OMG! OMG! Too sad but exciting!!! The best Marvel movie ever!!! Some 'old school' Marvel followers would not favour a bunch of Marvelians coming together to fight a single villain, but hey..it's understandable. What da heck..it's a nuclear bomb this movie!",
        "Travelling by bus for a total of 800 plus kilometers just to watch it in IMAX is all worth it. I haven't read the comics but I'm really into the movie. The visual effects are superb! The story line is not dragging. The movie is like a puzzle, that was perfectly fit by the Russo Brothers! The fun is there, but it's so brutally dark that left us speechless.",
        "It's been a day and I can say this movie was cinematic perfection. Seeing so many characters on screen, and how incredibly well this film was edited, it's honestly very impressive. Alan Silvestri delivered an amazing score that no other composer could have done, with a film this big. I say this as a huge Brian Tyler and Hans Zimmer fan. The Russo's have made a film that will be tough to top. I wish the film was three hours. Maybe Avengers 4 can satisfy my want. 10/10 for me based on what I said above. Can't wait to watch it a second time.",
        "This movie has it all. It ties up a lot of loose ends, along with opening new doors for new chapters of the MCU. Every character, good or bad was relevant and had input that was valuable to the movie and not just filling in a bit of screen time. But the true hero of the movie is Josh Brolins fantastic portrayal of the mad Titan Thanos. Had it not been CGI character he could actually be a contender for a major acting award. But this is also thanks to the writers and directors. I would give it a 10, but nothing is perfect. However this is as close to perfect as a comic book movie could ever be. D.C just give up. Again. WOW.",
        "It was really good.\n\nDr Strange gets flak but that's only from idiots with half a brain.\n\nWatch it, it's great.",
        "I wasn't in love with the movie as a whole. It was cool but was just so busy because of all the characters. Thanos actually made the movie, a great character with lots of different sides to him and deeper than I anticipated. He was my favorite character",
        "If you want to see a Scifi movie that is amazing from start to finish with all your favorite characters then this is the movie for you! Great movie that takes you on a ride that makes you realize that even super heroes are more than just fighters. This is a great scifi movie!",
        "Never, just never say this movie is better than Dark Knight just dont! It is good but not close as good as Dark Knight.",
        "I am overwhelmed after watching the movie. It's Epic in every aspect from action,CGI,story and dialogues. Its a True Marvel masterpiece. I am very impressed that how perfectly Marvel fixed their villain problem. Thanos is unlike any other villain avengers ever faced. Movie also delivers some bewildering surprises.The movie is very emotional too but again marvel put some solid humor in the movie. Action scenes are 20 times of 'Civil War'.Over all its best movie of MCU. Eagerly looking forward what next gonna happen because the ending is killer one.",
        "Never have I ever walked out of an MCU film so surprised and speechless! The studio really outdid it with this one! Infinity War lives up to the hype in the most amazing way possible to the point it even lives beyond the hype. With a mixture of such a great sense of humor, which seems to be a common thing now for the MCU to the darkest toned segments you'd think it's a DCEU film (Yes I just said that). The ending is just honestly the greatest yet sudden gut punch, that one would never even come close to thinking about coming from Marvel, but that's what makes the film so great! It knows that it is taking risks but that's what a good film does, therefore what is brought to the audience's attention is the fact that no one is safe!!! Go WATCH INFINITY WAR! NOW!!!!!",
        "The attempts to pull on one's heart strings when they had already announced movies for half the characters in this thing post \"End Game\" is insulting to the intelligence of viewers. I have no idea how the end can make people emotional who literally know exactly what will happen by the end of the next one (unless you're a child, of course). Thanos is also one of the worst and most thoughtless villains ever constructed, incapable of understanding how both population grows exponentially and how resource depletion works. Despite having all the power, he also doesn't have half the brain necessary to realize offing all the Avengers would be the smartest move, or maybe, ya know, like creating more resources and planets, since he has legitimately godlike power by the end of it. This film is at best mindless entertainment with tons of CGI and quality acting, but don't be fooled, it's just as formulaic and predictable as a freaking Hallmark film. All Marvel is at this point.",
        "Mind blowing!\n\nNo words to talk about this movie Every second is entertain for me. I sit on the seat like dummie NO MOVEMENT. Marvel now adding some fun in movies i like that. Now just wating for avengers 4",
        "Silly humor, I didn't get Thanos logic, it just didn't make any sense to me. If you are not a passionate marvel hard-core nerd, you'll probably not enjoy the movie.",
        "The movie was a lot of fun and more than up to Marvel's high standards, but the plot line doesn't track. If the infinity stones are so powerful and so dangerous, and in the hands of Thanos can give him the power to wipe out half the universe, then why not just gather them up and take them to the mega-sized black hole at the center of our galaxy and launch them into the gravity well? Once they are sucked in past the event horizon, NOTHING, not even Thanos can get them back. And if there is any blow-back from the infinity stones as they are being destroyed, compared to the size and power of a giant black hole that sucks in star systems, planets, and other black holes for a daily snack, they would be nothing. Anything as dangerous as these stones, no one should be able to have.",
        "The movie is great and Marvel keeps kicking out fun shows. However, the logic of this scenario doesn't track. If these infinity stones are so powerful and bad, and if gathered together by Thanos they pose a threat to half the universe, then why weren't they gathered up, taken to the super-massive black hole at the center of our galaxy, launched into the gravity well and destroyed? No matter how powerful the blow-back from the stones, compared to a black hole that swallows star systems, planets, and other black holes for a snack everyday, they would be nothing. Once beyond the event horizon, NOTHING, not even Thanos could get them back.",
        "Very predictable. Main heroes get no time to shine. Subplots are cliche. Despite some very good actors and, at times acting, all depth to the acting was stolen by the writing. Perhaps that was why the music was do prominent. So that despite my boredom I would know what to feel.\n\nI like super heroes, I can appreciate quality acting and action scenes. But this unimaginative writing is symptomatic for why so few Hollywood films are exciting.",
        "This movie. this damn movie. I cannot express how good this was. The acting, the action, the characters, the effects, THE FREAKING ENDING!!!!!!! This movie has done things too me. By far the best Marvel movie. I'm trying not to say too much because u don't want this spoiled, this movie needs to be experienced raw without spoilers. This movie is amazing go see it. #ThanosDemandsYourSilence",
        "Marvel Studios laid all of the groundwork for what should've been the greatest Marvel film. But they hired the bland-as-hell directing team of the Russo Brothers again.\n\nMinus One star for their direction which lacks focus. It feels like they are just organizing actors, not directing them. So many wide shots with people standing around just talking or fighting.\n\nMinus One star for the overdone, unrealistic CGI backgrounds. The only locales that look real are the ones taking place in NYC. Way too much green screen.\n\nMinus One star for some of the false emotional beats. I felt a little embarrassed for getting all sad about one particular character's demise when I realized they were just setting us up for a big \"Gotcha!\" moment with the next Avengers movie.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War was a great movie, but there were just 2 flaws; .1 It had too many characters, .2 It went too fast. It switched from one scene to the other in a really fast pace, for some people hard to keep up with... but overall a great movie!",
        "I think this film is the best film for the marvel fandom this film is dramatic action packed and has great characters and story this film does not deserve being this good and this is coming from a film that had all the potential for being a cluster flop and we as people should not deserve this film and this is the best superhero film since the dark knight",
        "This is a story about a being who wants to save the universe. Who sees the big picture and know's that no matter what the cost, be it family or fame, he will sacrifice all to save trillions. Some people call him the villian, but will he be remembered as a savour ? Are the Avengers putting their selfish needs ahead of the greater good, only time will tell.",
        "The writing and the dialogue between characters was just fantastic. They really did a great job with this movie!",
        "I enjoyed watching this movie, it was so great, amazing",
        "# Best marvel movie of all time Everything was excellent",
        "(No Spoiler Review) Okay, I don't know where to start ...\n\nFor those who haven't watched yet, book your tickets right now and those who have already watched will know what i am talking about. The hype was more than Ever. The Excitement was more than ever. Infinity war was filled with Emotions, Comedy, drama and Action. I don't think there was any scene where i wasn't excited or drawn into. Goosebumps never left my body until the movie was Over. The fight Scenes were just Amazing to watch. We got a Villain, who held his own in front of our Heros. The level of Acting was just out of the world. The Comic timing got Everyone in the theater laughing out of their seats, the intense drama got everyone Emotional. It would be hard to wait for the next part but i guess it's worth it. Avengers - Infinity war was not an Experience, It was a Life Event.",
        "Avengers infinity waa is good watch film.. And the super heroes demise was sad.. we miss them. But coming to the film, the movie is very good in its extraordinary taking as well as the cat performance. More over the technical expertise wow awesome.. superb movie overall.. should wait for the second part til next year...",
        "The plot, the characters, the acting, the effects, everything was on point! Go see it!",
        "Wow. I don't usually do movie reviews but this has got to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I have never been through so many emotions in a short span of time. Everything about this movie is Phenomenal.The soundtrack, the visual effects, the acting, the menacing characteristics of Thanos, EVERYTHING. I entered the movie with high hopes, and was not disappointed. I laughed, I cried, and I was drawn in by the action scenes. This movie entailed everything that a good movie possesses. I will be seeing it again. Do not waste your time, and GO TO THIS MOVIE. I didn't know it was possible, but now I am even more in love with the MCU.",
        "10/10, iron you are superb. The others are tooo but the way the movie is shown. It is awesome",
        "When I first walked into the theatre I was already so excited...during the first 5 minuets of the film and had a wirl of emotions. The movie had such great everything! The music,special effects, acting and twists. I even clapped at one part! The movie is excellent and you should consider watching it because it's very enjoyable, and even if you don't necessarily like the movie then still appreciate the directors for working with so many of these iconic hero's and squishy all of them into this film and having to handle this massive movie....so congrats to you Marvel and the Russo brothers you made a filming masterpiece in my eyes and hope you all see that too.",
        "The Russo's are geniuses. They did the impossible and gave enough screen time to a ton of characters who are crucial to the MCU as a whole.",
        "The Russo brothers made it RIGHT! all 3 act's of this movie made me want to see more. NEARLY ALL OF THE MCU were on present on screen. EPIC BATTLE SCENES, characters lost or were they? Story lines finally come together to make the MCU fans wondering in WTF just happened. I saw some tears in kids eyes. If you're disappointed In this movie, then i think you have problems that a GREAT MOVIE can't fix! Remember people it's a fantastic story of fantasy and action and IT'S PART 1 OF 2... I hope you enjoy the show!",
        "Great CGI and visually good scenes, however i think the plot and script was bad and the charecters are the same old pain in the as* enoying ect. ect.",
        "Good movie but at the end it's a popcorn movie I can't imagine it's among the top 10 movie of all time ... It's pure CGI and Visual effects how this can be with Godfather, Goodfellas, Fight Club ...etc.",
        "They needed to work on Writing.\n\nMovie is very slow and Time Machine Concept they used were not fully illustrated.\n\nThanos character needed to show more in a Proper Way.\n\nOverall One Time Watch movie\n\nLast 30 Minutes were the Best.\n\nRest of the movie were all Talking and Talking",
        "Many complaints about lack of character development, when it seems that many have been missing the biggest development of all: Thanos.\n\nInfinity War is a film about an antagonist, not a villain. Thanos is a tsunami - a wave of destruction with no preference or ideology - with no mercy.\n\nOur superheroes have had their development through the 100+ hours of origins and sequels, so it's no disappointment or surprise to see the Avengers \"assemble\", and simply \"get on with it\", and after everything, we still with part II to come and conclude this epic. But for now, this is about Thanos and his story, everyone else is in the background as Josh Brolin dominates the role.",
        "I guess I will be dissenting reviewer here among the many other apparent glowing reviews here.\n\nI have watched the various Marvel movies and in particular the Avengers series released over the last 5 years. This one has got Marvel heroes and villains raining in left right and centre from the start with limited background or story to set the scene. The comedy in the face of apparent disaster seemed misplaced.\n\nAnd I have to say it has probably got the most anticlimactic ending ever. I won't go into the details to avoid spoilers for those of you have not watched it yet. However i appreciate this was probably to get people to watch the next movie. But myself and the rest of the viewers in the theatre i was at today was shocked at this abrupt ending with little meaning or explanation. Was not impressed hence the 4 rating.",
        "Strengths -Every comic book reader's wet dream -Visually the movie is nice -Entertaining action sequences -Follows multiple characters along different paths so you don't get bored fast\n\nWeaknesses -Like every other superhero movie, it caters to the younger audiences, which isn't a bad thing, but adults may find it too silly -Story is too simple -Too many jokes & comic relief characters -\"Shocking\" ending",
        "Firstly to those who feel it's 'clever' to give a 1/10, why? Really? In all honesty if you are trying to make a point, let me tell you, you're not. It is stupid and infantile. This is a 10/10 banker. If you can't sit back and just enjoy this film, the humour, the effects, the great action then I could not in all honesty recommended ANYTHING for you.\n\nI am really going to look forward to the next one, at least I hope tbere IS a next one!! This was a thrill a minute, started off at 100 miles an hour and never let up. It has enough in it to keep people of all ages enthralled.\n\nSo, again, 1/10? Give me a break!",
        "We are an MCU family and LOVED this movie. I love all the characters. The actors are amazing and really make you emotionally tied to their characters story lines. Russo brothers did a fab job. Cant wait for Endgame",
        "This movie blew me out of the water, as a comic book fan I was skeptical of such a large scale movie with my beloved superheroes. However, the movie was phenomenal, such a ground breaking film. Breaking records here there and everywhere and so worth it. Definitely living up to the hype.",
        "Wow just Wow. This Movie is a blast. From start to the end. For me easily the best marvel movie so far. Also Thanos is simply incredible. Badass, but sometimes also a being with feelings. Best villain so far.\n\nThis Movie is so good, don't know how they want to top it with Avengers 4. The expectations are incredibly high.\n\nDont understand some critics here. There must be not more explanation in this movie. Every marvel movie lead to this point. Every marvel movie till now explaint more than enough for everything.\n\nFor me perfect movie, but i cant wait for the next part.",
        "I love this film. For the scale and sheer mass of a project like this I think the Russo's did an amazing job. The exposition is key for me: too much and I'm clearly watching a Michael Bay film.Too little and well, it would be a straight to DVD flick. This is just below perfect for me. It's a 9 because there are inconsistencies in logic that slightly tarnish an otherwise excellent film. I have to remember that it's only 50% of the story so maybe I'll track back and change this amateur review.",
        "A must watch movie! If you haven't seen it yet, i can recommend that you watch it! 100% worth it!",
        "This Movie was good because it was all the movies from the last few years leading up to this,the final one was endgame but this was the cause for why they are desperate to kill thanos and not let him take all the stones . They're all in seperate places,some on earth others in a different planet trying to fight him but they weren't able to take all the stones and at the end most of the people disappear into dust. All the actors played their rolls really well. The theme of the film was really good because Iron man fought the man who who has kept sending people his way to attack him and the city.",
        "This was such an epic movie from start to finish had me hooked",
        "I love Iron Man because he is humorous, wise, and always selflessly dedicating. After watching all the series and then watching this movie, I am very distressed for him.",
        "I swear, every one of these cool, powerful, trained warriors acted like idiots without power or any tactical thinking ability. The special effects etc tend to distract you from the horrible treatment of the Marvel heroes, at least.",
        "I am supporting hashtag of #thanosdidnothingwrong. its confuse always me that avengers shouldnt have to fight with thanos because logically he is right and other side what about life that nature has taken too much time(almost billion years,from single cell to giants) to evolve and live.",
        "If there is something which is better than this movie, then that must belong to different galaxy or different planet, as I can definitely declare the film as the best film of earth.\n\nDirection 10 on 10 Actors portrayed the characters perfectly and flawlessly.\n\nNo Spoiler! Please go and watch the film. But yeah, please watch the all 18 films before watching the movie.",
        "Best movie ever seen in my life , ohhh baby what an outstanding STORYLINE, CGI , ACTING ,, everything in this movie is THE BEST ,, the movie will definitely make cry if you are a REAL MARVEL FAN , this movie is very very deferent than other avenger movies, i'd give it more than 10/10 if I could \"IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND DEFINITELY\"",
        "Absolutely amazing film. Ever since I was a kid I would imagine what seeing a comic book brought to life would look like, well this is it. Thor and the Guardians Steal the show, but everyone really contributes to the success of this comic book masterpiece",
        "I felt like bored with marvel jokes. Awkward sometimes. More action, less jokes. Thats what people wanted.",
        "I will not go into details, better reviewers have done that already.....talking about acting, the CGI, the story, the difficulty to get all those separate stories intertwined into 1 kick-ass movie.....I will only say that IF this movie does not get at least 5 or some Oscar nominations, there is something wrong with 'the Academy'....that is all.",
        "Rarely have I watched a sequel film that fully lived up to the hype. This one did for me from the opening minute through the credit scenes.",
        "Infinity stones cannot help get rations on the table cause it is \"finite\" after all?\n\nthe limited resource theme makes good sense in a closed system. but in an infinite system as it says so on the tin, not so much. genie snap! 1. all of plastics biodegrade safely into the soil, pollution transmuted into fresh air, etc. 2. planets get biggie sized --not all planets, just the inhabited ones. no sweat right?",
        "I have been anticipating this film for an enjoyable MCU 10 years. I was a little concerned as I wasn't overly impressed with the rather lackluster Black Panther (or the Lion King retelling) which suffered from over enthusiastic use of obvious CGI and suffered a Mary Sue character (T'Challa's sister if you hadn't guessed)\n\nHowever Infinity War was absolutely EPIC. Finally a decent MCU villain, fully rounded, deep and gained my sympathy despite my best intentions. A fair few surprises and an absolutely storming finale.\n\nI get the feeling Ant Man and the Wasp is going to struggle fill the gap to Infinity War 2 (or whatever it's called).",
        "10/10 Can't wait for avenger 4. There're so much question for me.",
        "There are a lot of movies that are rated worse than this one that are clearly better: inception, lord of the rings, matrix, usual suspects, and the list could go on. I know I'm not the first to say this as many people have stated this in reviews before. Although, I really liked this movie and thought this movie was an 8, the ratings need go down.",
        "I just dont have words to describe . I would say best hollywood multistarrer ever.",
        "A lot of better than first and second part for me!",
        "So excited to watch twice! Love it so much! When is the next one coming? Can't wait!",
        "I think Marvel should have made a solo Thanos movie before infinity war. They could easily started this movie with Thanos having 2 or 3 Infinity Stones already.\n\nBut overall it is a great Movie and don't deserve the low ratings many people are giving!!",
        "So it's finnally here, and was really worth the wait. So let's dive into it. All the acting was pretty solid and good but was never weak. The main reason I gave this movie a 7 instead of a 6 is because of how well it handeled it's sub plots so well. I looked at how little each character actually got on screen. It really didn't feel like that in movie. That put aside let's talk about the plot overall. The plot was pretty good and I felt it was well paced. There really felt like there was a reason to worry for these characters and I felt true suspense. Thanos motivations are pretty good until you think about it to much. It really tears the movie down when you do, so it was a bit forgiving to let it slide and keep this a 7/10 instead of a 6/10. Overall it was a really good time and I really enjoyed myself watching it. I suggest it to any McU fan and anyone looking for good natured action and suspense.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my review and have a great day",
        "Was very very disappointed with this movie. It just did not have anything going for it. I mean there were moments that were good. But you cant just rely on a couple of big moments to carry the entire movie. There wasnt a story. There were constant loopholes (like Thor's varying powers. He cant fight Thanos but a dying star light gives him nothing but a sun tan). Most importantly the humour was not working at all. This after thor ragnarok which just was awesome in ghat department.\n\nOverall i would say i was as disappointed with this movie as with BvS. I guess i wont be watching Avengers 4 as well.\n\nP.S. The critics reviews of Avengers infinity war make me skeptical. They may not be paid reviews, but i guess they are scared of giving a bad review to such a huge movie.",
        "Just not worth it. Skip I if you can. Plus 2 1/2 hours.",
        "Sort of a part time avengers/marvel fan, have my favourites and dislike some heroes... however this film changed my mind on everything! Comedy, action, tense and shock factor ending... one of the best films I've ever seen, bravo!",
        "So its all led to this.... But the problem is this much awesomeness CANT be only 2 hours and 29 minutes long! (Actual film length is 2 h 17 m.) This movie needed to be LOTR Extended edition long. Hell if were to be the worlds first 5 hour movie it would have been a GOOD length.\n\nSo the movies only flaw is that its very rushed.\n\nOther than that it is a AMAZING movie, But very predictable. And I like that about it. The ending was exactly what I expected and exactly what i wanted.\n\nI am content.\n\nTo state it plainly, this is The Dark Knight level.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is an incredible show that should leave all fans of Marvel speechless before the work done by Joe and Anthony Russo. The film has everything to be the new benchmark of the blockbuster as it connects the visual prowess If James Cameron would like the public to get tired very quickly Super Heroes movies, it is clearly not with this kind of feature film that it risks happening . Perfectly punctuated and filled with offbeat humor and intense emotions, the feature film is one of the best Marvel with the first Avengers and The Guardians of The Galaxy. A new cardboard insured for Marvel Studios which we wait the following impatiently",
        "Thank god for marvel, for this beautiful heroes, I love you.",
        "Seriously, The only thing I compare to this is The Dark Knight triology, WATCH IT NOW",
        "Infinity war had so many expectations going into it. Almost every expectation was met when it was finished. The movie does a fantastic job juggling all of the different characters together while weaving the last 10 years of marvel together. They were able to make it emotional and intense without a dull moment. The movie has its negatives but the positives far out weigh them. For a movie of this scope and magnitude it did a great job.",
        "10 years in the making and the Russo's knocked it out of the ballpark. I went it hoping all the heroes would get ample screen time without the movie feeling rushed or plot holes or things being unanswered and was not disappointed. The movie is balanced with bits of humor but also very serious. They really did a good job with Thanos' character, he is the perfect villain. Just a all around action packed, adrenaline ride!",
        "Great movie. Great movie. Great movie. Great movie.",
        "This movie, easily exceeds expectations. I never read any comics and fairly like SuperHero movies. I did not like Black Panther much, I still believe that Black Panther is over hyped. But Infinity war did that magic. I watched it in IMAX 3D. I was blown away by the emotions it ran through me. It might be a little fast paced for some people.\n\nAction sequels were amazing. Villain was great. This is exactly the movie, what all 10 years of Marvel Movies deserved. This is the only movie, which I am strongly considering to go back into cinema and watch again. Definitely, worth the hype.",
        "Everything was almost perfect. The cast, the villain, the fight sequences, it all happened like a dream. The humour was good too. The ending was not only touching but also kept me craving for the second part of the movie.",
        "If you know and love the MCU movies, this is the greatest 10 year anniversary gift you will ever get. This is the ultimate reward for you time and attention over the last decade. Bravo, Marvel Studios, Bravo!",
        "This movie includes funny moments, major loss and crossovers that gives goosebumps.\n\nThere are a lot of characters in this movie but all of them has a true meaning in this movie. The past Marvel movies (Guardians of the Galaxy, Black panther etc.) has lead to this point.\n\nI have watched this movie more than three times and every time it still gets me. Good music, good actors, memorable scenes.",
        "This movie is so AWESOME with a GREAT cast! OMG I could watch this over and over again that's just how AWESOME this movie is!",
        "2 1/2 hrs of my life wasted, this was so boring I went to bed after the first hour. Pointless drivel put out there to make money. NO real story, NO believable characters and absolutely NO point to it. Glad I didn't pay money to see it",
        "Was waiting for it since Infinity war , which increased my expectation from a movie very high. But after watching ENDGAME , I can say that my expectations are fullfiled completely.",
        "A perfect set up for the Finale of the Marvel Universe. So many open Questions! I thought they did well in Story telling, with great CGI and an absolute amazing Villain. Loved to see all those Superheroes together!",
        "I'm not not a hard core follower of super hero films in general. So that group I'm sure will tear me down. But with that said, I will say I am a 'Gardens of the Galaxy' and 'Thor' junkie. I really can watch either of those movies over and over again. Entertaining and funny. So I didn't know what to expect with 'Infinity War'. My opinion, EPIC. Well done. As is expected you leave room for further expansion of the story line that will/should feed off into the existing standalone movies. You can only cover so much in one movie.",
        "I can not with words describe how amazing and Well done this movie was! I have been waiting for this movie for so long and i had really really big expectations. But it still blew my mind. I really was not ready for this. When the movie was over i literally felt like i was walking out from a funeral and it was both amazing and absolutely heartbreaking.\n\nThis is so big, the movie is huge and it feels amazing to be a part of all of this. Wow and dont even get me started on seeing all the characters from different movies suddenly together. I was amazing to see the energy and chemistry between them. This is definetely going to be the biggest movie of the year!",
        "I would like to thank Kevin Feige, Russo Bro's, Screenplay writers and all the cast along with everyone involved in the movie. It's worth a long wait for the fans. Well, I had more and more expectations from the movie, but this movie exceeded my expectations. I watched it in IMAX and it's a worth movie watching in IMAX screen. Although the movie runs for 2 and half hours odd, but the screenplay is done so nicely that you'll feel the movie is fast. Thanks @Marvel Studios for giving us the awesome entertainment from the last 10 years and I'm sure you'll keep giving the same in future.",
        "Thie movie gave me everything I wanted. The characters are weak and human, which is something I hadn't seen since The Dark Knight. Although all heroes assemble, ehich is what all of us were eaiting for, the real star here is Thanos. The film gives us reasons to care abd understand him and what he has sacrificed. He is almost as fantastic as Heath Ledger's Joker which makes him the best and the star of this movie. If you haven't yet seen it I implore you to go and see it. This is the definitive Marvel masterpiece and deserves being praised for years to come.",
        "It was a great movie, but if you hadn't seen most of the previous films, you might feel like you don't know anyone. There is so much action, it's almost an overload. I would have preferred a bit more character interaction. I understand the limitations the filmmakers were dealing with; but it was hard to feel invested in the characters; I brought my investment in from previous films. Ultimately it felt like most everyone was in a cameo role.\n\nThat being said, if I were not aware of movies yet to come, I'd need therapy after seeing this. I give mad respect to everyone for keeping the important things a secret. Only spoiler I am going to drop .... 4 will definitely be a continuation, otherwise this one makes no sense.\n\nFinal analysis, totally worth seeing.... but emotionally exhausting.",
        "Infinity war was good but the hype surrounding it made for a slightly underwhelming experience for me. So many heroes and with so little screen time, it just lacked the charm we've been used to with the last few Marvel films.\n\nSolid 8 for me. Whereas Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther for me were definitely 9's.\n\nVery good acting and action scenes. It's by no means a bad film, it's very good but falls slightly short of Marvels own standards as of late.",
        "SPOILER: This movie was great. I loved it. Thanis was everything i wanted.\n\nThe saddest scene was when spider man died. Black panther dies as well. So does the guardians.",
        "Comedy and action at equal parts. Grab the biggest bucket of popcorn and your favourite soda and enjoy!\n\nYeah, the plot is meh but as long as you have popcorn in the bucket, why bother...\n\nBest thing after Guardians of the Galaxy 2.",
        "I can not say one bad thing about this movie! Can't wait for Avengers IV!",
        "This is absolutely not a 8.8 rated movie. IMDB you are cheating with us. very disappointing.",
        "This movie destroyed me. It was an emotional rollercoaster. I LOVED IT. Bring on the next one so I can die a little more on the inside!",
        "Totally worthy price of admission and the ten year build up. Marvel knows how to print money.",
        "What a film such a good ending, can't wait to see the next one",
        "Excellent & Great Cinematic Experience, Everybody Delivered at their Best.",
        "I knew this movie was going to be good going into it but I never could've imagined that this was going to be the outcome. I'm rather partial to Marvel movies and genuinely enjoy most of them but I think that this insane, wild and amazing crossover was the best of all of them. It was hilariously funny and tragically sad. I loved every minute of it.",
        "Awesome awesome awesome!! Best was hearing the reactions of the crowd on each scene (don't want to spoil it ;))",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is a movie unlike any other I have ever seen. Never miss watching this one. Cant be descried just by words but its one of the best movies there is. Everything perfect from direction to soundtrack to action scenes. With completely great story. And a Ending unseen ever and Mind Blowing",
        "Wow I really loved this movie such an amazing experience heartbreaking badass movie the cgi was great ,thanos is a really great villan the movie is long but you will not feel the time because it's fast pace movie and can't wait for avengers 4",
        "What a film both entertaing and funny at the same time.",
        "I really enjoy this film, I literately like everything about it.",
        "After almost 3 hours in the theater. And i still got out disappointed. The action scenes were amazing. But something was missing. Too much was going, too many planets. All in all, The 1st 2 movies were way better",
        "The ending left everyone wondering what they had just wasted 2 hours of their life on. The first half was very good!",
        "It was a good movie but it was too long and lots of extra scenes",
        "Honestly DC Movies are more interesting this is a hot piece of garbage yes there are some good scenes but like bro why are people crying lol it's so obvious there alive lol and the deaths are so badly dramatic the ending is pretty trash if you see people on this review list saying DC Fanboys are making bad reviews actually were not because were just stating facts Marvel doesn't suck but it's not better than DC.",
        "Infinity War is everything it claims to be and more. The creators of the Marvel franchise have done it again with this new film. The perfect blend of action, drama, comedy, and romance. A culmination of almost every film genre out there. A perfect climax to all the Marvel films thus far. Its safe to say that anyone who has seen this movie will definitely be tuning in for the next one.",
        "If you are a fan of marvel movies THIS is the last LEVEL !\nFor the people who give a negative review . i ask you this : why do you criticize this type of movies if is not your favorite style ! go to other types such as drama ;comedies, trillers or others. do not enter ! is not for you !!",
        "Through the lack of a consistent base thread and also completely devoid of character development, Avengers Infinity War is guaranteed to leave a bitter taste in anyone who values life and purpose mouths as they leave the franchise forever. I suppose the meaning of \"infinity\" would indicate the time until anyone would again read or watch anything by Marvel.\n\nThe only remaining thought would be, \"is there a way to unwatch this?\"",
        "Non stop action and a roller coaster ride, best Marvel movie!",
        "Terrible movie, way too dark. We go to superhero movies to feel good and escape our real lives. Not a single feel good moment in the whole 2 and a half hours. One liners? Maybe a half hearted chuckle. I was super excited for this movie and extremely disappointed. Marvel lost a rabid fan.",
        "Simply blown away and still processing what I just watched. So many mixed emotions and questions!?! Marvel has outdone themselves!",
        "First let me say that 10 years of emotions will be put into this film. From the first few minutes the intensity and tone of the film was lauded out. Prepare for deaths and all sorts of confusion. The cgi was fantastic the story really did feel like the end. Thanos was worth the six year wait it was absolutely phenomenal. Prepare for surprises, your typical MCU jokes but most importantly the tone felt like the end of an era. The action seemed more violent like they knew the stakes and the ending of this film may be the best movie ending ever. I never cry and I sobbed three times in this film. Prepare for this epic conclusion. I'm still shaking, even an hour after seeing it.",
        "What a great movie For my opinion this is the best movie in #Theavengers movie series It's so exciting and funny and dramatic Well done marvel well done I wish dc studios lern how to do good comics movies from marvel",
        "Fairly bland plot considering that it is currently ranked as the 51th best film of all time on imdb. Not much character development but I guess that is what the sequals are for. The consequence of that is that the film really feels like another filler movie to cash out more on the Marvel universe. Hence the ending of the film of course.\n\nAvengers infinity war does some good like showing different sides of the antagonist, explaining his motives and the reasoning behind them (unlike that stupid villain in Justice League), and making him do challenging decisions. I also liked the dialouge between the superheroes, especially the Guardians of the galaxy crew and Thor. Their scenes were really funny and I like the fact that humor is a central part between these characters, it makes the movie stick out from other typical superhero action movies, and it shows that it doesn't take itself so seriosuly. Those were some original points that stood out to me and made me not rate it a 3/10.",
        "It's been building to these 2 films. Within the first 5 minuets I knew this IS THE BEST film from the MCU. It had many answers to questions we've pondered from the start. I truly laughed & cried all the way through, over the years these characters have become friends & I felt everything they were feeling. The effects have improved greatly over the years, this film certainly blew your mind, smooth & flawlessly. We are certainly in for a huge treat with part 2.",
        "I loved this Movie saw it twice Both times it was Great",
        "Yea, this movie is it. Super engaging plot, hilarious characters, and dramatic beats that feel earned by the end. I love Thanos--he's one of the greatest villains in recent times because he's actually a threat. Cap, Iron Man, Bruce, Spidey, T'Challa, the Guardians, Thor, Vision, Wanda--they're all great and this movie wouldn't be what it is without them. I don't know what to say. I've seen it 3 times at this point and liked it more every time. Marvel has been hitting it out of the park for years and this really is the crown everybody calls it.",
        "Being an avid Marvel fan I, like many others, have been along on this ride for 10 years. This movie bring to light THE main villain of the Marvel universe, Thanos, who Josh Brolin portrays to the T. Thanos is a villain that throughout the film you begin to understand more and more. They created a relatable villain for all of our favorite super heroes to fight against. With this star studded cast it is easy to think that everyone could get screen time. Though some heroes get more than others, they still all get their fair share of time. The sheer scope of the movie is beyond comprehension but they somehow made it work fluently. You will laugh, you will be mad, and you will cry all at once. Never have I ever walked out of a Marvel movie without words to comprehend what I just saw. Go see this movie in the biggest theater you can.",
        "All I can say is... What the hell Marvel?? And, go watch this movie",
        "Aside from the usual spectacular action scenes, this film was beautifully emotional and hard on the soul of fans that have followed the entire saga.\n\nHow Black Panther got a best picture nod over this one is truly beyond me.",
        "Great movie! Lots of fun. It is really fun for me to watch the marvel movies as I read a lot of the comics as a kid. It's innocent fun with relatable themes for anyone with any sense of empathy. I can't believe all the negativity but I guess it's a sign Marvel is doing something right.",
        "This was the best Marvel Movie ever made. The writing was incredible, the plot was up to the mark. All characters did a good job, Doctor Strange was amazing with his jokes and Iron Man was really good, In my country most of the tickets were sold on the first booking day itself. India Loves You. Joe and Anthony you people killed it, My Top favourite heroes were : Spider-Man, Iron Man and Black Panther, I actually love all of em but these 3 are my favourite. Thanos was an amazing villain, the character was really good, I thing he's the best villain. I just can't wait for the Part 2 Like everyone asks \"Where's Hawkeye\" where is he Joe. Hats off to you guys. Love From India",
        "This is one, or the best marvel movie of all times. I was on the edge of my seat. Lots of moments that gave me goosebumps. Felt like a 10 year old kid. If this movie doesn't win an Oscar, the Oscars are fake news.",
        "Simply Good!\n\n\"Sorry, your review is too short.\" - Heh! What you want more to know? Movie is good. Dont want to spoiler so only this. Deserve 10 , gave him 10 stars , but here 9 , because even best movies can always be better.",
        "I dare anyone to do better...they crafted this movie with such precision and care I don't know how it could have been done better.",
        "Good, entertaining, creative summer popcorn flick. Nothing special or groundbreaking though.",
        "Infinity war was a perfectly entertaining summer movie. That is all. Not as good as the original Avengers, or as good as Winter Soldier or Civil war, but certainly better than age of ultron.",
        "This movie is full of too many characters so you hardly get to enjoy anybody! This is nothing but the worlds longest preview for the next film. Don't waste your time. Watch it right before the next one and save yourself time, energy, and torture.",
        "Incredible work by the Russo brothers, no character felt really overlooked and the movie has good paste, a good structure and plot. It's near to perfect for me. I think why this works is because this movie is mainly thanos his movie. Instead of avengers they could have based the title of the movie around thanos as well. Really well done and a very good setup for endgame (but it stands on its own as well).",
        "This movie brought together all the marvel characters. It was great. The action was awesome. I am team Marvel.",
        "I came to see the reviews to see what to expect before i saw the movie and by what people are rating this is none less than stupid, i can only summarise that the dc fanboys decided to log in and downplay this in order to make BVS not seem as bad. ive seen people give that movie a 9 yet this a 1? anyway the film is no stop action and having laid the gruondwork in previous movies they dont need a long drawn out story here and i for one am grateful, i watch these movies and a lot of fans want to see superheroes fighting against each other the dynamics of strength and abilties and clashing of egos and we get all that here, dont let reviewers who give this a 1/10 put you off seeing this i reserve those ratings for things like sharknado and other b-movies, i actually believe some of these reviewers should be banned as its obvious they have an agenda.",
        "Great action movie. I love it to watch. I watch it on Amazon Prime and the movie is so marvelous to watch.",
        "Idk how many times I've watched this movie. I just cant get enough of it. It's now my fav movie of all time... Waiting for \"End Game\" so badly.. This movie is just love. If you haven't watched it then what on earth are you doing!",
        "Great loved it lovely thor is lovely in the movie you cannot miss this great mcu movie",
        "I hope you never enjoy marvel movies again in your life. Your review is boring as Justice League. I think you enjoy cartoon better and DC movies.",
        "This movie is not good as much avenger 2012 and first spider man. The good thing about this movie is: it opens the door for next good potential movie.",
        "25 Superheros from approximately 18 Marvel Movies is non stop action & entertaining for most all ages. Each of the Characters were well written & perfectly played out. We enjoyed every scene. Highly recommended by myself and family.",
        "And I can't wait to see what will happen next. You are clueless and you don't know what will happen, keeping us all on the edge of our seats. Fascinating!",
        "What can i say? It's really fantastic. I love you Thanos!! He is so perfect. I'm waiting Avangers 4 with a great wonder. See you in 2019 Thanos..",
        "Avengers Infinity War lives up to the hype in all possible ways. From beginning to end, I didn't know whether to cheer or cry.",
        "Its done 8.9 score total this film is the top of the war we are waiting for. Yes go see it. You will not be disappoint. The 10 is a bit high i agree but so many trolls on imdb page to try to kill the rating i need to do something about that i never post review because bad english. So here you go marvel/Disney well done.",
        "First thing first: Marvel has hit a bull eye with it's post ten year celebration with this movie. There is absolutely no dispute about the fact that Infinity War is the most anticipated movie ever in the comicbook history so far but it is compelling to know that it is completely worth the hype. The movie had everything which a CB fan is looking forward to. From perking actions to tear causing dramas this latest installment in the Marvel series is a treat to watch. The only irky part about the movie is that it rushes to end quickly after a steady start, but when you have to pickup 22 superheroes' storyline that is what you should expect first. Go to the theatre and have fun but take tissue along with you too.",
        "I'm a little late to the game but I finally got to see this movie and it absolutely floored me. I can't add much to the other positive reviews on here except to say, if you haven't seen it then you won't be disappointed. It's brilliant.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War was an epic movie going experience that will stay on your mind for some time. The Dark Order and Thor were awesome. Thanos is just a mean person. #bookit",
        "I love this movie , exciting , suspense and great!",
        "As a fan of the real Infinty War saga in Marvel comics this film held no surprises other than the fact that it lacks so many of the heroes that actually faught in the war, including the one that saves the universe (and I'm not talking about Captain Marvel that the epilogue eludes to). It was entertaining at the time but it really was nothing more than a \"look how many big name actors we fit into one movie\" experience.",
        "I was crying, cheering and then very mad at the ending. Every emotion experienced which a great movie should be like!",
        "If you have enjoyed the long road leading from Iron Man to now, the pay off is real. Outstanding. The Russo Brothers have proven they are the masters at telling these stories. I can't wait til Avengers 4 and the final chapter of the Thanos saga.",
        "As a marvel comics and MCU fan this movie was sheer joy from start to finish! Thanos was awesome and I cannot wait for Avengers 4!",
        "Okay so i have never been a fan of the MCU because it was never as intense as i wanted my movies to be and because it always seemed like they didn't direct this movie for a comic geek like me,but rather for children(as Disney does) Well,this one was for me ! I dont think this movie can really be reviewed or compared,because it has no peers.It was a roller coaster ride and i was left wide eyed and grasping at my seat the WHOLE movie,THIS is what 10 years of building can accomplish,and i think every comic book enthusiast should watch this movie,it doesn't get any better. Now for some reason i appreciate the rest of the MCU movies so much more.",
        "All types of twists in this movie. And stay for the after credits awesome.",
        "MCU does not play around.... I'm sad for the loses... but damnnn what a movie....",
        "Looked forward to watching this and was not disappointed.",
        "See this as soon as possible if you care enough to read reviews. This movies impact is in your unpreparedness!!! The Interstellar of comic book movies. It moves fast. It tackles enormous plot points, throws all the heroes into the storyline with thrust yet with finesse and comedic touch. 5 story lines converge and collapse into 4, then 3, then 2, boiling over into an intense, sometimes shuttering series of climaxes. This is then reduced down to a concentrated chapter of events that will leave the outside viewers and fans alike giddy and shaken. Sit back and enjoy the new canvas the directors and writers splatter, like bright paint, both nostalgia and Fresh life with our characters.\n\nThis is NOT age of ultron. This avengers is to avengers 1 what ragnorak was to Thor 1, except with everybody youve been waiting to see again, plus guardians, plus mystic arts, plus an antagonist that shouldn't even be called a movie villain, but an inevitable turning point character. Im enjoy your surprises",
        "One time watch movie.Hype is very bt very disgusting movie",
        "This movie is colorful, entertaining and sometimes funny but I really don't understand why it is getting so good reviews.\n\nFirstly, the bad guy has no charisma since he's just another pile of polygons without true facial expression. His cruaulty is absurd and his true purpose is elusive. This is a really boring character.\n\nThe visual effects fills 98% of the movie but it's still just above average. For example, the iron Man and Spiderman bodies are fake and disturbing with their faces floating on it. Too much visual effects kills the visual effects. Finally, this outbidding of characters is really exhausting. They all fly like a pierced balloon and shoot ineffective missiles for 2 hours. This isn't a movie, this is a parade.",
        "Stay at the end for the teaser!!!! Do not leave it's worth it.",
        "Like all other marvel movies. Only this time they stretched the movie so much they need two movies. Every time the heroes are going to lose but at the end they win, i bet in part two the heroes still win and everybody who vanished will return. So i think the story is weak, but for a marvel movie my time was well spend.",
        "Just magnificent piece of work the director nailed it the actors nailed it everybody did a good job",
        "The CGI was way too much when compared to the other Avengers titles, maybe its due to Thanos's big head, but one thing is for certain, they should've toned down the CGI on this one a bit.\n\nI really loved the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, and one of the reasons was the comedy and the music, but over here the jokes were not funny. It looked like they were trying too much. The characters a bit boring, it would've been better if they were not part of this movie.\n\nThe movie was all over the place, with characters moving in and out of locations, Killing off characters, even the characters with super powers were using Iron Man suits. They made it as complicated as possible.",
        "This movie is absolutely Incredible. Perfect balance between the actors, great prelude to the storm ahead in Endgame.",
        "I was in the movie Theater like a kid at 1cent candy store lol loved it",
        "I was totally speechless at the end of the movie. The entire cast were at the top of their game in this film. The action scenes were obviously fantastic, the CGI on Josh Brolin was perfect, the special effects were amazing, and the movie included over 60 characters!!! This movie was off the charts! I can't wait for part two to come already. Everyone needs to see this movie!!!!",
        "Greatest Marvel movie ever I can wait to see Infinity war part 2",
        "The MCU has been my favorite since I watched the first Captain America in elementary school. Every single film felt like it was leading to something bigger, and this was it and it delivered better than I ever could have imagined. Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus once again do a fantastic job with the screen play. I was amazed at how well they were able to balance every single character. Most characters don't have more than 10 minutes of screen time but everyone has a moment to shine, their presence feels much bigger. I really think credit is deserved for Thanos, everything about him. Josh Brolin does fantastic in this role; he is the best villain in a superhero film since the 2008 Joker. The CGI on him was also flawless. The visual and sound effects were superb in general. I was a bit worried about that after Black Panther which had mediocre CG, but this film looked excellent. This movie is paced in a way that provides exciting action throughout and offers a chance for the big characters to have deep moments, particularly with Star-Lord. If you haven't seen this, you need to, it is nothing short of spectacular.",
        "Fall all true marvel fans, you will not leave the theater the same way you came in. Enough said.",
        "This movie is amazing. Full of action and emotions, great story, straight to the point, and probably one of the few movies that end in a bad ending. Which is nice, since we don't see those type of movies that often. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!",
        "An epic film in many ways. I guess you'll need to have seen most of the MCU films of the last 10 years to completely follow the plot/story, there's action all the way through.\n\nMany surprises to shock you, scenes that nearly left me in tears and made me laugh out loud. A proper emotion puller. Will add that whilst I've never read a comic, I could predict what the next avengers film will have in store due to the ending and lack of characters (hinted at in previous post credit scenes) which were missing from this. But my anticipation is at \"cannot wait level\".\n\nThe largest complement I can pay it, is that at nearly 3 hrs long, it still felt as though it was rushed and not quite as polished in flowing smoothly as say ragnarock, but I still felt It left me wanting more. Well done to everyone involved.",
        "A movie that will make you owe. Quick climax to action moments where you truly feel as overwhelmed as the events going on. Overall satisfying, pushes you to ask what is next as answers are far from being unveiled. A notable comment is to point out how this movie tries largely to patch up Taika Watiti's mess in Thor: Ragnarok with regards to Thor's losses. Would have rathered not hearing the nonsense of Ragnarok to start with, especially if it ultimately comes undone.\n\nAnyway, one thing is certain, in Avengers 4, the Avengers must go back to their phase 1 roots and....Assemble.",
        "Some people're annoyed that they got to see no introduction to their superheroes.MCU has been running for a decade through our solo superhero movies.What more introduction do you need? This movie first starts from where Thor Ragnarok ended.But some people just wanted to ride the hype train so they went to see the Infinity War without a single knowledge of Marvel Cinematic Universe. Avengers Infinity War is amazing.Thanos and his black order perfectly lived up to their hype.Get ready to see a rejuvenated form of Dr Strange,Thor and Wanda.Whole theatre was exploding during Thor's entry in Wakanda.The humour is also perfectly executed.The Wakandans including T'Challa may have a very short role but they've still managed to make this awesome. If you havent watched the movie already,trust me,this is all worth it.Enjoy it in your nearest theatre with your friends and families!",
        "The Russos did it again, The Script was great, The Score by Alan Silvestri was fantastic, The Action was awesome and Thanos is in my opinion The best superhero Villain.",
        "Excellent . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\n\n. . . . . . ..\n\n. . . . . ..\n\n.",
        "I have watched it and feels like something more to have. I watched 2 time to understand the plot. So what is happening to it. Hopefully it will Releasing soon..",
        "Amazing action. Slightly weak plot, but they made up for it with the progression. Can't wait for the next movie!",
        "At the very moment of the movie, it was thrilling. This wonderful movie was not only the best of Marvel's movie, but also the most entertaining and exciting movie I've ever seen.",
        "If it wasn't for all of the edgy kids who think it's \"cool\" to give this masterpiece a 1/10, this movie would have made at least top 3 greatest movies of all time.",
        "Simply blown away by how well made this is. It keeps the sustain through out the movie and you still want more because it's just never enough ! We all know how it would end to this, but we still got surprised anyway ! Definitely worth the hype, just...please don't miss this. You will missed the greatest movie of all time (at least until the next one) MCU the best !!!",
        "In this action packed build up to Endgame, I must say that Infinity War is one of the greatest juggernauts of a super hero movie! It's laden with humor, action, sadness and jaw dropping special effects!",
        "He was an amazing villain that kept all the Avengers on their edge and made them think it was a bit hopeless to really go against him.",
        "This one is masterfully woven from the culmination of Marvel movies throughout the years. Truly amazing!",
        "The character development for Thanos was so good that it made me think that maybe he was right. He was the villain that surpassed all the other villains from the past Marvel movies. Trust me, this is the movie that might have changed the MCU.",
        "Instantly comes to top 10 greatest movies of all time. I saw it and there's no doubt about it. Must watch for everyone.",
        "Infinity War is worth watching. The usual comedic banter between the casts, the awesome CGI, amazing plotline, the results did not disappoint.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War was clearly much better than Avengers: Endgame in the sense that 1) it was better in terms of writing, 2) it is the true culmination of an entire decade of MCU films, and 3) Endgame gave me more questions than answers.",
        "The way it ended left so many different plots for the next movie and new characters that are in the Comics.",
        "The Russo brothers really did a great job in making this movie, an epic conclusion to the first decade of MCU.",
        "This movie has clearly a much darker tone than the previous ones, but that is what makes it more special. Really cool action scenes with occasional humor made it stand out more.",
        "Im going to go out on a limb and say (BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME)\n\nNothing could prepare me for this movie... it brought alot of closure and seamless switching between battles.....\n\nA must watch",
        "Bored me to death, very childish even you know what's coming in the next movie",
        "Don't get me wrong. The movie is great and all, but is it just me that nobody cares about any of the genocide that has happened in the world and is still happening today, but as soon as it happens a movie it's the greatest thing since sliced bread? Pretty pathetic excuse for a human race we are to say genocide in a movie is wrong but still let it happen in real life. Do we get to see all of the murdered native americans return to life as well or just all the white people who died in the movie?",
        "So I went to watch the film with some of my friends and this film honestly saved us from the movies we're getting from Hollywood quite a lot lately. The movie is definitely worth the hype and if you haven't watched it yet, then you're definitely missing out. The actors did good, the plot is amazing, and i CANT wait for the next Avengers film just to see what would happen to those who have died in this movie and those who were not present such as Hawkeye and Ant-man. As always, you did good Marvel.",
        "This is a truly eye opener avenger movie that i ever seen. All other marvel movie NOT even close to it. 1 thing i would like to point out, IRON MAN Technology has gone up insanely. I am super shocked ! As for the bad guy Thanos, well it did bring me some sadness and of course his super power ! Hey, even our big guy green man CANNOT find thanos ! Well the only sad part is, some of the heroes are gone......SIGH..... Well not going to mention who are the heroes. Looking foward 2019 part 2. Well worth movie ticket money !!",
        "To be honest a lot of what I want to say is already said by other but one thing i like to add . I loved thanos he has reasons and motivation so few villains do but so much wrong in this story so many characters dead without any good reason so many stories not told because they want to fit 20 characters in one movie i think it would have been good movie if the movie is 5 hours long but i didn't enjoy this at all . And stop the pathos (cheap comedy)",
        "This is the first review I've ever written, and I think this is the perfect movie to take that spot. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time and my favorite MCU film to date. I'm a particularly big fan of how they took the character arc of Thor, I thought it was very well done. The humor felt natural to the characters, and not shoehorned in as I felt some of the jokes were in Ragnarok (also an enjoyable film, though). There were some moments of humor that didn't quite land with me, but that's okay. I also very much liked how the handled Thanos and the movie, to me, is more of a Thanos film than an Avengers film. Josh Brolin does an excellent job. There is one particularly emotional scene and I almost began to sympathize with him. Those who have seen the film will know what I'm referring to. There are many surprises and things you won't see coming. I went in only having seen one or two of the trailers, and I'm glad I did. See it as soon as you can and avoid spoilers as much as possible. It is, to me, a truly excellent film. 10/10 would recommend and 10/10 would watch again.",
        "This movie was great! It did a great job bringing characters together and action was good can't wait for the next one!",
        "I haven't ever watched any Marvel movies before this.. my friend told me that this movie is awesome so I bought tickets for it.. after watching it I couldn't understand what happened.. then I started watching all the movies chronologically... And today I watched Endgame.. thank you Marvel",
        "This movie had me at the end of my seat. First movie I went to go see 3 times in theaters",
        "One word.Magnificent.After 10 years of waiting,Thanos finally come for the infinity stones.",
        "Dark with a lot of fighting, just like all the avengers movies should have been. Of course the classic humour was not missing and was just about the right amount to keep it a good action movie rather than a comedy like the last movie, end game.",
        "One of the best marvel movie ever made after iron man 1st and the avenger 1st this movie really outstanding iron man in this movie really awesome.",
        "This is one of my favorite Marvel Movie, I love the cast, acting, humor, emotionally. I can't wait to see what would happen in Avengers 4",
        "Best avengers movie.\n\nGreat actions. The team successfully linked several story lines into one and created this master piece.\n\nbut my heart is really broken after watching it. Can't say why here. :(",
        "I have to say when I rate films I am very sparing in my scores They say there is no such thing as a 10 I can tell you in no uncertainty that the Rosso brothers have delivered a masterpiece for MCU and not only is this the best Avengers but also the best Marvel film of all time If you can't enjoy a film with Spidey Iron Man Thor Doctor Strange Black Widow Vision Black Panther Captain America Falcon Hulk Loki Star Lord Wanda and anyone else I've missed The storytelling,the humour,the scene locations the seeing old friends,seeing the Hulk so weak (lol) the share will of Thanos(great casting) to complete his mission will live with me for many a decade This film is deffo a 10/10 Watch it and tell all of your friends",
        "It's a action movie for 12 year old with no real plot. Everytime the movie wants to be funny, it is more embarrassing than anything else. I don't know why I give even 3 stars for this. Probably because of my respect for the 12 year-old, who like that movie.",
        "That cliffhanger ending isn't much of a cliffhanger, we've watched all these movies for that to happen? almost perfect marvel, but you don't have this fan fooled.",
        "Sometimes you just want to hang in the couch and watch something and not think too much. Just be entertained and relax. Well, this movie isn't that relaxing. Lots of action, fighting, fast dialogue, many characters and change of locations. A dwarf, a racoon, a black panther, a spiderman, a robot, aliens and hulks. And all have some kind of supernatural power. Great kids stuff. Quality of acting or character development are not really main aims here. Effects, animations and stunts are really good. So, turn your mind off, grab some popcorn and enjoy. An hour after viewing you'll have forgotten you've seen it.",

        "Can't understand the hype. This movie is so bad on so many levels it is beyond words. Even the CGI is bad. Thanos looks like he came straight from a video game. The story is as banal as it can be. The plot nonexistent. I don't know maybe Im just too old for this s$#%..",
        "The amazingly satisfying payoff to a 10 year super saga.",
        "10 Years, 18 Films. Marvel has set a staple for the super hero genre and Avengers: Infinity War is no exception. Avengers: Infinity War, follows Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his quest to assemble the infinity gantlet to destroy half of a life throughout the universe as a fractured team of avengers, race to stop him. The characters are superb, the dynamic that each character brings to the table is fascinating and enjoyable, Marvel has taken a universe that they have been expanding on for the past 10 years and throws it on it's head. First time viewing this movie, I was on the edge of my seat and the second viewing was just as enjoyable being able to take in all the little details of the film. Well done to the Russo Brothers, the Actors and the Crew for making a cinematic event that lived up to my expectations. I highly recommend Avengers: Infinity War for any comic book fan, and super hero fan.",
        "This is my first Marvel movie, not quite my type. Stars for the visual and sound effect.",
        "I love what Marvel having been doing with classic comic book stories since Iron Man, but this film brought one of my five favourite storylines alive and did us proud. Such great writing, acting, directing and production. Everyone involved deserves an Oscar for creating a film that touches so many people.",
        "This movie is teetering between PG-13 and R for how absolutely disturbing it can be (for PG-13 that is), but thats not bad. Its gripping in fact, for a super hero movie, it's just what it needs. Thanos is possibly THE best super villian to ever grace a superhero film, he isn't just someone doing it for fame, glory, wealth, or because he just loves to wreak havoc. He has a clear goal, and some of the things he does over the course of the film hurts him, and that shows how much dedication he has to doing what he thinks is right, you sometimes feel for both the villian and the hero, as it SHOULD be.\n\nRecommended, excellent.",
        "The best Marvel film so far non-stop action from start to finish amazing seeing all the characters together cannot wait till part two Ironman, spinderman, Thor, and rocket the best characters Will be a classic film had that return of the Jedi feel to the film",
        "This film has broken me in many ways. But really there is not much to say, i am not going to include the spoilers but can honestly tell you that this time you can believe the hype!",
        "It's a great time to see the movie in theaters, even if you didnt go, go buy the digital copy or blu ray and use surround sound if have a speaker system. About the film this is very entertaining, I recommend to anybody who saw the last 3 movies",
        "Wooooow. Loved it!!!! Was disappointed that I was left hanging at the endbecause I Didn't realize there would be a part 2. But this movie kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole viewing.",
        "This movie is my most anticipated movie for 3 years, and when I sit on the cinema, it feels like this is the time that I wait for a long time. And when I came out from the cinema, I feel like I want to watch this movie for a thousand times. And what's the best in this movie is the visual effects. I'm really proud the Industial light&Magic, Weta Digital, CineSite, Framestore, Digital Domain, and more... This movie deserve the best visual effects awards",
        "This movie is a 10 for me.\n\nGlued from the beginning to the end. It was awesome to see how the Producers were able to connect such a huge story, different fight scenes and a huge number of characters. Understandably that most people are furious about how the movie ended, doesn't make it a less better movie. In fact this made me more curious as to what will happen in the next Avengers movie.",
        "Best marvel movie yet, been watching their movies for ten years and they still manage to blow my mind.",
        "Marvel's latest-and largest-production is far from perfect, but it melds its many, many elements into an impressive mix of humor and sorrow.",
        "Like I said, anyone who has rated this movie less than 9, has done it simply because they can't bring themselves to agree with the majority. Most of these are people with low self-esteem who have been at the receiving end of the world at large. Good to see, there are only a few such anyway. The movie is hands down the best movie ever created in the history of movies and that's it!",

        "I love this movie not quite perfect but would rate it a 9.5 if I could love the villain probably my favorite villain in a movie and one of my favorite endings of all time",
        "Fabulous, emotional, shocking i like it so much one of the bests movies in the world ever",
        "Don't come into this film expecting a masterpiece of grand proportions. The films action was above the standard for marvel movies, but the film tries to handle many plot lines at once and struggles to move much.\n\nIt didn't feel like a complete movie, while I understand that it is meant to establish the next Avengers (which goes unnamed), but the entire movie didn't have a payoff, it was a movie of setting up.\n\nIt was alright, but failed to meet the expectations it set of a \"cinematic experience of a lifetime\".",
        "Unlike anything ever done by MCU, within the first five minutes you are able to understand how heavy and hopeless the plot will be in this movie.",
        "Here we are 10 years later with one of the most anticipated movies of all time! The CGI was much better, the story was better...everything about the Infinity War was great!",
        "Avengers Infinity War was perfectly balanced as all things should be. But literally this picture is visually a masterpiece without doubt. Character arcs was well developt and the story/plot was amazingly good leaving us with shocking but outstanding cliffhanger. Russo Brother have once again accomplished a near impossible task to jam-pack dozens of superheroes into a 2hr40min film without any flaws. The humour was suprisngly on point and balanced the action and emotion. Overall this was a fitting predecessor for Avengers 4.",
        "Avengers infinity war is a must see for any marvel fan like myself seeing our greatest heroes come together like the guardians of the galaxy, spider man and many more but the highlight of the movie is Josh Brolins thanos easily the best baddie since darth Vader. I cant stress it enough just see it for yourself",
        "I took four 12yr olds & one 8yr old and it was universally panned for the bad ending. It is also irritating (after all of that screen time) to be held hostage to a short scene after a long, I mean long, credit role. I first thought the audience was in stunned disappointment but figured out by the hanging around something else was happening as well. Last scene should have started 45 seconds into the credits.",
        "Movie is the best movie I've seen..What I really liked in the movie was the serious tone and the real threat hanging over the Avengers.The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre.The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. And i love this movie and superheros..",
        "Great balanced(excuse the pun, Thanos) film that worked with over 20 characters, which could over totally toppled over with too many characters. A good continuation of the marvel universe that took a lot of chances.\n\nI can only imagine the people that are rating this as 1 star are the ones that are trying to stick up DCs sorry excuse for a franchise.\n\nI'm not a Marvel fan boy but I have enjoyed every marvel film that has been released due to good script, good acting and a good plan for this franchise to carry on so far. Marvel/disney....bravo.",
        "Frankly,just an action sci-if movie without any deeper things. We need to see more than explosions and unserious jokes. Please learn some from DC.",
        "A must see spoiler free. It's a remarkable achievement that so many characters are given something to do and with enough direction and \"film\" to make us care about it. The Russo brothers top their Civil War efforts, barely, but do indeed manage to bring us a clear story arc that doesn't waste time on unnecessary issues. I will rank this below their efforts in Winter Soldier, again barely. There was more espionage intrigue in that movie that was more satisfying to this viewer. But, in the current culture where superhero movie fatigue is a very real concern, and hype regarding superhero movies tends toward inflation of its true merit for entertainment, this monument should stand as a tight culmination of just about EVERY point raised and debated from the first Thor to last year's Thor. Which I find fitting and I'll refrain from saying more.\n\nGrade: A- Recommend",
        "Crappy ending and a crappy story line... Crappy ending and a crappy story line... Crappy ending and a crappy story line... Crappy ending and a crappy story line... Crappy ending and a crappy story line...",

        "Marvel have proven time and time again that they know what the fans want and they know what the fans need and this time they not only pulled off such an audacious film but perhaps the most star and risk filled film to date.\n\nWith such a ride from start to finish, a perfect balance between action and narrative story telling, Infinity War knows when to suck you in, pull back a little and then knock you down begging for more.",
        "Simply the most captivating and mind boggling thing my eyes have ever witnessed!!",
        "This movie will blow your mind and leave you got on your butt.",
        "Amazing! Can't wait till May 2019!! Action throughout and a brilliant ending that keep you guessing for a whole year.",
        "Infinity War is the first part of the climax of the MCU, and it is absolutely fantastic I\u00b4m already looking forward to part II",
        "I would say this movie is brilliant for how everything goes down in the movie from the fight scenes to all the comedies scenes and the ending. My personal favorite are the Guardian of the Galaxy scenes, they were hilarious. All around great movie so thank you for this awesome film. Cant wait for the next one!",
        "I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to supply a balanced, insightful critique of this film because I'm still struggling to make any sense of it. For it's torturous length I witnessed hundreds of explosions, hundreds of humans / supposed superheroes being tossed huge distances and then getting up again to fight another day, an adolescent spider kid who refused to take advice from his elders and betters and other nonsense. But the major thing for me was the NOISE. Relentlessly loud 'dramatic ' music, relentlessly loud banging and crashing, relentlessly loud dialogue... oh no.. wait... my bad. Relentlessly whispered dialogue that I couldn't make head or tail of, even while directing my lipreading skills.Sorry Avengers production team but if you want people to enjoy a film, make sure the punters can hear whats being said. Thanks .",
        "I can't describe the amount of adrenaline and tension this movie brought to me. All I can say is that this is the most brilliant movie that could combine all those stars together, putting every one of them at the super role ; excellent dialogues, funny among the serious and tensioned scenes, each role at this movie cannot be taken by another actor. Congratulations, you deserve to get all the credits in the world",
        "Good movie I like the way that they portrayed the picture (movie)",
        "I was 13 when I first saw Iron Man in 2008. Now I'm 23. Wow.....",
        "Even though the storyline is nothing like the comic, it was very enjoyable and I do like how they approached it without having the rights to all the original characters involved. The movie was action packed and hilarious. I look forward to how they'll proceed from here.",
        "This is by far the best superhero that has ever been made, even beating Dark Knight. In fact, even the Villain is better than the Joker. Let me say that the acting in the movie is top notch, especially where it needs to be. The look on RDJ's face, the determination on caps face when facing the army, the resolve in Thanos's eyes. The movie lacks in CGI for sure, but there is so much soul in this movie and it will make you think for days after you have seen it. This movie is the high point of the MCU, how can it ever get better?",
        "I had great expectations for this movie, and it delivered plus more. Its 2.5 hour with action, humor, interesting dialog and all your favorite marvel characters. Ok, some very few are missing, but all the big \"players\" are involved. By far the best superhero movie of all time. Delivers on so many levels. The new thing about Marvel movies is that they have put in a lot of humor in it. Like the last Thor movie and Guardians movies. Avangers IW are kind of like that but the punchlines makes you crack out laughing. Feel like this is a mix of everything that is good about all the individual films.\n\n2.5 hour was not enough. I want more.",
        "I believe that this is one of the best action superhero movies I've seen in my entire life. Thanos was one of my favorite characters in this particular movie and in general in the Marvel Universe. The whole concept was impressive. The way the story moves is outstanding. A true Masterpiece!!!!!!",
        "Cant really add much to the other great reviews but just had to rate this, even if comic fans knew a version of this would happen it will make u cry and laugh throughout the movie.\n\nThe Mona Lisa, Sistine chapel, EM football 92 Denmark - of the MCU so far",
        "What a brilliant Movie, Everything was balanced Thanos CGI and everythin was amazing. Thor was the best part, and wow Tony and Doctor Strange! you guys are massive in it. Brilliant Story and Amazing Timeline with Great Cinematic Experience ever. You cant demand more from the movie! Brilliant! Just cant wait for next!",
        "The BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE SINCE THE DARK KNIGHT!!!!",
        "Just massive and breathtaking and so good. Little tiny knit-picking problems here and there but they just took 18 movies to lead up to one big one and it's as epic as it should be.",
        "First of all, thank you for ending so much wait with this epic movie. The roller coaster of emotions, the laughs, the satire, the drama, the heroic scenes .... This is just a perfect way of how marvel actually respect their fans !!! Can't wait for the Avenger 4",
        "Is incredible how the entire people involved in this teamed up to deliver this outstanding production. From the script to the final edit, everything is very consistent. Only the special effects have some lacks of craft and details, but overall is the ultimate Marvel production.",
        "This is so well done. The pop culture references (see aressted development).. the melding of all of the characters and movies into this mega blockbuster. Just wow. I don't review so strongly often.",
        "This movie is amazing. Best movie ever. There was a lot of hype for this movie and it was not over hyped at all. This was an awesome movie. It's so amazing and I can't say enough about it.",
        "Ok, I accept I haven't seen all of the previous movies from the characters featured in this film. Thankfully, I had seen Guardians of The Galaxy and their inclusion kept my interest. Massively CGI'd, taking it almost into cartoon territory, depth and story were sacrificed for effects. Having said that, it was a good enough yarn.\n\nAnd how much did Vin Diesel get paid for saying \"I am Groot\"?",
        "Good story, good set up for another film. But for me even though the film is 2 and a half hours long it still felt a bit rushed through",
        "One of the best avengers movie from the triology. Don't miss this one",
        "Warning!, This review was written by a 14 year old me in 2019. The views reflected in the following review are not necessarily shared by me in the current. They're purely kept up because of nostalgia.\n\nWith a premise so high, for the most ambitious crossover ever. It is really refreshing to see a movie, that can take that premise. and make it big like marvel can.",
        "The ambition alone is astonishingly crazy and a huge risk for both Marvel and Disney to really get this done and it really pulled it off so well. Great plot, amazing acting, life like CGI, beautiful visuals, great humor and writing, and most importantly the perfect villain in any super hero movie ever made",
        "A wild ride from beginning and leave you wanting more",
        "Just watched the movie a while ago. It's true time flies when you're having fun. Movie was very entertaining, hardly a dull moment. I thought the combination of comedy, action, and drama was spot on. Thor was just sick! Glad I got another set of tickets in two days. Definitely worth a second, maybe even a third watch. The hard part now is waiting for another year.",
        "Fairly typical for Marvel. As with most of their films, if they cut it down by about an hour it would be good. As such it actually felt like it would, ironically, never end.\n\nThe action was great and there were some very funny moments but these were quite jarring alongside the more heavy bits. It felt like the directors couldn't quite decide to wholeheartedly go comedy or serious and tried to do both.\n\nI guess the only way to stop Marvel making these films is to actually stop going to see them but somehow I always think that the next one will be better. I'm always disappointed.",
        "Too Star Trek: Next Generation for me.\n\nMy 5 year old son was bored. Sat's it all really.\n\nA baffling mess.\n\nWhat Hollywood has gained in special effects, it's lost in story telling and I know which one I prefer.\n\nDon't waste 2 and a half hours of your life watching this confusing mess.",
        "By the end of the movie, half audiences were gone. Must found it boring and left in the middle :\\ . . . . Oh wait a sec...",
        "Many years have passed and many films have come until this time comes. Did it deserve it? For sure. AIW is not the perfect movie, but it's definitely in the highlights and Top 3 of Marvel's Cinema Universe. Russo found the right trick to harmoniously distribute the film between 23 characters and a titanic evil, with beautiful visual effects (more than 10 studios worked on them), stunning action, humorous moments, emotion and a story that keeps you interested. The end will leave everybody with their mouth open and looking forward for the next part. Are you ready?",
        "This is not just a movie. It is an intricate symbiosis of strong emotions which were lost somewhere in time till now. It is no doubt by far the most heart quenching, questioning piece of superhero franchise movie who has made me go to a state of no-judgmental state of a fan. This movie is not about wow factor or box office or fan club. It is realisation.",
        "A \"10\" for its genre, an \"8\" for a general movie, resulting in an overall \"9\".\n\nMarvel studios somehow managed to give nearly all of its superheros in a single movie, yet get each of them adequate screen time. Without going into details, the plot involves the intent of extermining half the life in the universe by a villain who is arguably the greatest menace ever put on any superhero or fantasy film.\n\nThe CGI and action is great and although there is some comedy, this is a dark movie and the ending is the most shocking ending I have ever seen in a movie (it has a sequel due to be released next year) except for perhaps, the original Planet of the Apes movie.\n\nNot a perfect film, but pretty close to it, especially considering the difficulty in interacting many characters.",
        "Other than the cliche destruction of a major city, this is a entertaining movie. Grab your popcorn and drink.",
        "What can I say good that has not already been said by a few people on here. The Russo Brothers from CleveLAND Ohio have created a movie I could watch 20 times and never get bored of. Well Done Joe and Anthony. Am so looking forward to 1 year from now when that untitled movie rolls along. Keep on making great pictures like this, thank you for this Mega-Epic story with all the elements mixed in.",
        "Guter Film, hat Spa\u00df gemacht! Auch die 3D Umsetzung war richtig gut.",
        "Infinity wars does what the superhero movies do the best: if you can leave your brain at home, you can enjoy the movie in the moment.\n\nBut the moments were beautiful. Nothing much to analyze.\n\nEven if we assume the possibility of the great powers of Stark's suit, humans surviving in outer atmosphere and planets without a support is something I cannot really un-see.",
        "It's unbelievable just how many different films and characters this movie can cram in. Some funny moments but ended up turning the movie off before it ended. The Avengers started off well but this film is just too much and far too many crossovers. It's ruined the franchise for me",
        "Best Marvel movie yet, but kids needed serious counseling afterwards (lol)",
        "I'm DC Comics fan, but I admit that Marvel is better. This movie is complex, both due to many characters, but especially to the negative character. It's designed to look forward to the sequel.",
        "CUNEYT ARKIN DUNYAYI KURTARAN ADAM DA BILE BU KADAR SIKILMADIM. FILM TAMAMEN UYDURUK. COK UZATILMIS.",
        "I don't think somebody who hasn't watched any other marvel movie should watch this. Or somebody who has no idea what is happening in the MCU. For all others, i think this might be one of the best marvel movies of all time.",
        "Wauw, what great movie. Enjoyed every minute of it, worth the wait. Great storyline, great characters.",
        "I dont have anything to say amazing movie best movie from Marvel good job watch it watch it noooowwwww",
        "This movie an unapologetic perfection of a movie for Marvel fans. For those who have paid attention and appreciate the pure joy Marvel Studios has brought to cinemas for the past 10 years you will not be disappointed. There is twists, turns, unexpected moments, visually stunning action sequences and packed full of edge of your seat emotions. All characters get their moments to shine which in its self was incredible but the story that was told really knocked it out of the park. Can't wait for 2019.",
        "No spoilers.\n\n\n\nFrom the first second to the very last, you will be on edge. Anticipating, scared, laughing, crying, excited. Credit to the writers, directors, actors, every single person who has worked on this film and every Marvel film before it. You have built a world that is simply incredible.\n\nAnd Thanos? Well, he demands your silence.",
        "Absolutely blown away with how good this film is. 10 years in the making with all the hype surrounding it and did not disappoint. From first minute it is unrelenting and pace never drops. This is a must see for not just marvel fans but anyone that loves an action film",
        "Wow\u00a1\u00a1, nuff said I do not give a 10 cause you can not rate a superheroe movie with a 10",
        "I finally feel as though they have taken a leap. This movie was really well executed, beautiful CGI, and very good writing. The plot flowed surprisingly well considering everything that had to fit in this movie.\n\nI felt as though the humor was very well balanced. The action was choreographed soo well.\n\nOverall, well done Marvel. As a fan since the very beginning of the MCU, I was very impressed. I left the theater with that \"Holy crap, I need to see that again, and again, and again\" feeling.",
        "Easily Marvels best film! The Ruso brothers had a tremendous task of taking 10 years worth of Marvel films and putting it together into one epic film, and then succeeded. As for Thanos he's esily the best MCU villain, his character has so much depth, he's not your average bad guy and Josh Brolin plays the Mad Titan so well. I'll be seeing this movie a few more times for sure!",
        "I worried about how well executed this film would be because of how large the cast is. I clearly didn't need to though. This film is worth every minute of its 2.5 hours.\n\nThe flow of each character's individual story and their connection to the over all plot is done seamlessly. It is never focus too long on one area and you are moved from one scene to the next in a way that doesn't feel jarring. I was completely immersed into the story.\n\nI only give it nine stars because it made me cry and I'm mad about it.",
        "Any Marvel fan will absolutely love this movie. My son says it's his new favorite of all-time. Not sure I'd go that far but certainly a great movie.",
        "Defying the odds by delivering continued, even enhanced, brilliance as the franchise moves on. The best by far... so far...",
        "Despite watching this with raised expectations, I found it satisfactorily enjoyable. In general, this movie is very entertaining. The story is great and has the kind of end it deserves. The villain is logical and realistic. The movie managed to cover so much details without haste.\n\nI'm giving Avengers Infinity War a 10.",
        "Literally the best film of the whole Marvel MCU, filled with incredible battles, hilariously funny moments, and a shocking ending. Highly recommend this film.",
        "Action packed movie that seems like it was an hour long",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is a type of movie that is great in the sense that it brings together all of our favourite superheroes but is bad in the sense that it ends with the audience waiting to see part two. Everyone who worked behind the scenes and in front of the camera gave this movie everything they had. The Marvel Cinematic Universe went together perfectly like a puzzle being put together. This movie balances the jokes and action in a perfect manner. Avengers: Infinity War will always be a exciting experience for fans young and old.",
        "I think Marvel really set a new bar for this kind of movie , can't wait for part 2 to come out",
        "I am a HUGE Marvel nerd and was excited for this movie. I didn't expect it to be good, but it was WAY BETTER than I had expected.",
        "I mean I personally expect a lot for this, but there's a lot inconsistent things between this and the first movie's, l just hope that the last one have a better climax.",
        "I can imagine that this is what the final season of game of thrones will look like! Every minute was thrilling and I felt like even though the cast was spread out not a second was wasted! Great mix of action, comedy and excellent story telling. I just don't know what else to say other than I'll be watching this film many times! Epic movie with a couple of sad moments but plenty of kick ass ness",
        "I just loved it, wonderful movie. Definitely deserves a 10",
        "This movie still has me in awe of its greatness. I absolutely loved this film and so happy to be on this thrill ride. Avengers Infinity War doesn't disappoint in fact it by far exceeded expectations. Thank you to the cast and crew for this amazing epic movie.",
        "The movie has unexpected end, and it was long but full of action and moments that would keep on edge. Overall, I really enjoyed how they related different heros from diffent places, and related the story to previous movies. 8 our of 10 Very Good.",
        "Everything\n\nIt has everything\n\nJust watch it\n\nJust do it\n\nThe only self gain in this world to cure your crushing anxiety is this movie\n\nSo overall\n\nIt's F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S",
        "It's just another disney movie with cringe jokes, boring soundtracks and poor fight scenes. Visuals were good tho I would say this is the only mcu movie which has better visuals but color grading was meh.",
        "I got more than I wanted. I expected a good action movie but I got a great and emotionally over welling films",
        "To anyone who gave this film a 1 rating.... Justice League must obviously get a -10 enough said!!!!",
        "There are too many characters in the film and it confuses the audience The dependence of the film on the next part is another weakness.",
        "Honestly one of the most entertaining movies ive ever watched in my life.",
        "What a movie .... can't explain with word... just dint want the movie to end....",
        "It's like graffiti on a Jackson pollack painting while listening to a Mozart opera at a Chinese buffet. Individually...great parts. Some better than others. All together...too jumbled.",
        "Where should I start? Geez what a spectacular movie considering that the amount of characters are in it.how did the russos do it? Fun, exciting,emotional and just fun!",
        "Excellent movie super stars every scene Best superhero movie ever",
        "Honestly had me feeling like a kid again. All those personalities in one movie. I laughed and would have cried too but just had too many emotions going on. Unreal movie, can't wait for Captain Marvel to come in and destroy Thanos",
        "Amazing throughout.. ! Thanos is probably the best villain to hit screen on par with Heath ledgers joker.",
        "If you understand MCU really well, have watched all the 18 movies before this one and all the TV series connected to the universe, you will emotionally shaken realize that the stakes are really high. The Russo Brothers are clearly understand what makes MCU works. Nearly everu character has their own shining moments, the team-up was FANTASTIC, and the call from the past was unbelievable. I still can't believe what I just watched.",
        "Thought the movie was fun, and entertaining from start to finish. If you go into the movie without a biased approach you will love it for what it is. A fun going cinematic masterpiece, that produces substance, spontaneity, and emotions. The movie had flow and rhythm. From awesome packed fight scenes, to breath taking cinematography, landscapes, and music. This is a movie that will leave you wanting more. Don't listen to the nay-sayers, go into the movie remove any cynicism and you will understand the movie for what its worth. Listen to the words, envision yourself as the characters, there is a humanistic side to everyone including the villains. After all its made by actors, so enjoy it, even if you are a critic.",
        "I havent watched a Marvels movie for a long time. I just think they keep on coming to often, I loose interest. But on a 12 hour flight from LA to Europe you kinda have to watch a movie or two. And maaaan this was awesome!!! Loved the mix of characters, that alone made the film awesome! How can you give this movie a 5 or even 4 out of ten? Did you guys watch the same movie as I did??\n\nPeace!",
        "Esta pel\u00edcula solo se puede describir con una palabra: \u00a1INCRE\u00cdBLE! 9/10.",
        "I am super impressed with the character development given to Thanos. Thanos had so much screen time which is something that fans of the MCU have longed for. Also, the cliffhanger at the end of the movie will keep you running back for every single marvel movie for the next few years.",
        "Thanos is the best villain in MCU, great storytelling, felt no left a plot hole",
        "We don't deserve this movie. There was some sort of glitch in the matrix. See it while you can!",
        "Expect the unexpected. As someone who tends to think the marvel films could use a more serious tone with graver consequences, this film fit it out of the park. The film is more of a thanos story and plays out as such, where he is the hero of his own tale. His goals, while extreme, are justifiable in his own mind. This, among other things you just have to see in the theater, make him one of, if not the best, comic book villain to date. I payed full price for my seat but I only used the edge.",
        "It is a literally mind blowing experience. a 2h 40mins of intense (i hold my breath while watching this for the first time) and also really got chills all over in various scene.\n\nAND HULK scene is just damn good! THOR IS REALLY A GOD! can't wait for avengers 4!!",
        "This film is fun, funny, dramatic, and serious. this film is one of the best films of the mcu.",
        "From start to the last scene at the end of the credits, Avengers: Infinity War is a jaw dropping, action packed, adventure that will leave you craving more as the end credits start to run. Thanos is shown to be not only the biggest threat the Avengers has yet to face, but has also proven himself to be the best written and performed villain the MCU has had to date. This movie is a must see for any and every comic book fan out there and is highly recommended to those who are casual fans and sci-fi/adventure and comedy fans.",
        "Avengers Infinity War is a movie most fans have been waiting for since the first Avengers came out in 2012.(At least I've been waiting that long.) We all had an idea on what was going to happen; Thanos kicking everyones ass, and that is literally what happened! The humor was out of this world funny, the action scenes were next level awesomeness and the cliff hanger ending! This is the most anticipated movie of the year and you are not going to want to miss this summer blockbuster! A must see for any movie goer!!!",
        "The movie lives up to all the created hype and it destroys all the fan theories and predictions. Its a continuation of 18 movies and 10 years so if you havn't watched all the previous movie. Then THANOS WANTS YOU TO STAY HOME.",
        "The film was 1000/10 and people who gave 1-2-3 are stupid. They are probably dc fans and probably didn't understand a thing from the movie.",
        "There are no words to describe this movie. To write a spoiler free review is almost impossible considering how much happened in this movie. Marvel has outdone themselves! Everything about this movie was incredible. You will leave the theater satisfied with action, saddened by grief, and angry at Marvel all I one!",
        "Really loved this movie, i did not expect to be such a wonderful one. Loved Josh Brolin as Thanos, which made Marvel movies incredible.",
        "What else can you say? The plot is all right. Behind the plot, Infinity War contains something more than that. Those individuals hero films make Infinity War even better. They have the connection between it (since the first avengers movie you can tell). During 2.5hrs, we are watching something predictable things, but do not forget this is a marvel hero movie, those marvel individual movie themes gives you some special juice. Marvel has ambition and Stand Lee as well.",
        "The best avengers movie till date. Watch it now unmissable action and humor at the same time",
        "I really enjoyed this film already watched it twice and i'd love to watch it again",
        "Years ago when the first Avengers movie came out I quit watching half way because I was confused and super bored. Too many characters and too many story lines all at once to invest my time figuring it out when I care 0%. I prefer Samuel L. Jackson with a purple light saber than an eyepatch. Over the years I've caught pieces and snippets of other Marvel movies and they weren't bad! Guardians is fun! Black Panther is cool! Then Netflix got Infinity War. We watched it on Friday night. Whaaaaat? It's so good! Today is Saturday and we just finished watching Infinity War for the 2nd time. Exciting, fun, even if you don't have much of a backstory. Good times all around. Gonna check out what other Marvel movies Netflix has. 10/10",
        "My word - what an amazing treat it was ... can't wait till the next one. Didn't know how 149 minutes went. Was so glued to the screen and didn't want the movie to end. Jaw dropping climax with a little bit of emotions at the end.",
        "Yeeeeeeah I liked it. It was pretty good. Some pointless scenes, subplots etc but overall... I liked it. The visuals are stunning, I wasn't even watching in 3D or IMAX and my socks were blown off. It was a bold move, mixing everybody together in new places not even on earth- moving away from the more realistic side that was established originally. But it paid off. It did have emotional effect, mostly in one scene with Spider-Man, while the other 'emotional scenes' weren't very riveting. It was full of surprises and I enjoyed it. Good job guys.",
        "Best movie ever in marvel studio untill now 2019 ... ... ...",
        "If you like action, humor, and drama, this is your movie. With a climax that is BREATHTAKING! The best character in the movie is Thanos. He has so many layers. Even though he's the villain he can be very loving. He truly does love Gamora. This movie is just amazing.",
        "Dramatic, exciting & humoristic as one. Story is very easy so you don't have to watch all other Marvel movies. Except The Guardians of the Galaxy so that you know the chemic of the squad.",
        "A movie hasn't made me feel this way in a very long time. I read up on Thanos' storyline after getting home. A sliver of hope? Maybe, but I know how movies can divert from comic origins.\n\nJesus, stunned. What an epic movie. I know people have different opinions and all that, but truly, if someone doesn't like this movie then there's something wrong with them. Good gawd, I still ... we're floored. Rocked. Stunned. Stoked and did I say stunned? Theater watch FOR SURE! And... don't let anyone spoil it for you, holy crap.....",
        "The beginning of the end has started with this one. No spoilers here because this is a must see for yourself. Since the first Avengers, everyone has wanted to see Thanos face the Avengers and boy does he. Everything about this movie is what people love about the MCU. The directors did a great job mixing the comedy, action, and drama together and pushing the story the whole time. This is a movie you'll want to see again right after it is over, at least for me it is!",
        "Too many idiot chars this time. Stark's sarcasm is now dump and not funny and smart anymore, Spiderman forced jokes got under my skin, and Peter Quill looks just demented and not over the top. Thanos is frankly the best character of the entire movie, been rooting for him. I'm giving 7 stars for the great action, that was epic",
        "When i watched the movie i amazed so much ,because the movie was above the Expectations , and the movie its not about a superhero things and actions, its mixed with drama and romantic with unexpected storytelling ,and for sure the vfx was prefect job, and marvel changed the mean of superhero movies , thank you marvel for this fantastic magic, alimax22",
        "Great story. Great build up. Thanos as the complex civilian was great. Great CGI. Great fight scenes. Just a great movie",
        "Thanoss is a great villain and all the characters do well with the screen time given",
        "Giving this movie 10 stars will be still considered under rated for me. 10 years of hype leading upto this and it did lived upto it. Can't get over this movie. Deserves a special place in heart. My favorite superhero movie of all time.",
        "The story is zo unexpected. It really brings the emontion",
        "This movie is beyond imagination,best movie ever,cant wait for new avengers",
        "Avengers Infinity War is one of those rare gems where a movie exceeds your expectations. The action sequences and tge production design is phenomenal no surprise in that as its an MCU movie. Thanos is a fantastic villain, I despised his actions in the movie but there was something about the way his character was written that makes the audience know why his motives and they've shown him not necessarily a conflicted character but a character that has a certain level of humanity props to Josh Brolin for making Thanos believable and not some generic bad guy. This film really shocked me with some of the decisions and some of the character arks and I'm glad that it didn't go the safe route. Honestly I believe that this may very well be one of the best MCU movies and one of the best to come out this year. My only problem with the film is that the film didn't flow fluently which I get because there were so many subplots but that's the only issue I have. Lastly, the Russo brothers deserve the respect of every movie fan for putting together such an epic and grand movie and making it good.",
        "Short and simple don't want give anything away it's by far the best marvel film recommend everyone go see it",
        "Despite the huge anticipation for the Goliath Infinity War is, one could enter the cinema plagued by the fear of traumatic directorial execution.\n\nThe Russos managed to pull off the feat of providing screen time to all our beloved heros and their storylines as well as bringing unexpected depth to the villain - I found myself flittering on the edge of agreeance with the big purple chap!\n\nVery entertaining and looking forward to 2019!",
        "A while ago, before this movie came out, I thought this would be a complete mess. I'm glad to say that Marvel knows how to juggle its large cast of characters like no other company out there, and the direction they took this story is actually pretty great. I don't have much to say about this movie except it deserves the cash its raking in at the box office, and it's certainly worth checking out if you like any of these movies.",
        "There is no way that this is better than the lotr fellowship of the ring, fight club and empire strikes back.",
        "This film was a very enjoyable experience and was packed with many great scenes and blended the groups well as the light hearted super heroes were completely separated from the more somber ones.",
        "The way that they had all of the characters interact and come together was interesting and I liked that part. However, Thanos was the worst part of this movie. He and all his minions looked extremely fake and out of place because it was so obvious that they were CGI when standing next to the real people. And Thanos just does not look intimidating or evil. At least not like someone who is supposed to be the villain of a huge superhero movie. He seriously looked like some bodybuilder bro. Also I hated how it seemed like they wanted us to feel bad for Thanos or sympathize with him. They used scenes of him and his \"daughter\" (someone he kidnapped after killing half her planet) and a scene of him crying (????) to make us like him? Um, no, his sole mission is to kill half the universe. That being said, I'm still confused by his motives. Why does he feel like he needs to balance the universe and why does he feel like it's his job to kill a bunch of people? He just didn't make sense to me and it kinda ruined the movie.",
        "The only thing I would like to say is that DC should learn how to make movies from Marvel Directors. Couldn't take my eyes off from the screen even for a second. Just amazing!",
        "Definitely one for the books! Can't find a fault.\n\nWe all know there is going to be a next one. It's only fair that the story be told in detail as mich as possible.\n\nThe way Thanos was portrayed was spot on.\n\nJust the right amount of funny and emotions. Even with all the hype, it didn't disappoint.",
        "It was the best movie in MArvel cinematic universe so far !",
        "The movie is great and fun, definitely raising the bar.If you are into comics, this is the movie we deserve! But just stop with the overrating and all the 10/10 seriously! Thanos relation with Gamora feels pushed, there's no explanation of so many little things, this is no where close to perfection but doesn't make any less enjoyable though. Watch it, have fun and be \"sane\".",
        "Long story short...one of the best avengers movies yet. Amazing action, hilarious dialogue between characters, and a bold ending that will no doubt leave you shocked. Deep and powerful emotions throughout. Really impressive CGI and crazy fight scenes. Definitely exceeded my expectations. Go see it.",
        "I am truly impressed with this movie and I thought that this one would have win an Oscar. I was especially blown away with Thanos and his Malthusian Theory. Although he was referring the all the population throughout the different universes, he has truly painted a factual picture about of life and the suffering of the population in planet Earth. I agree that it is a sad concept but his ideas and speech was very deep and quite concerning. Although I would not like to see half of the population get wiped away :D\n\nThank you Stan Lee for your most remarkable creations and I sincerely hope you will rest in peace and will find comfort and joy in the heavenly stars above. :')",
        "Folks, this movie is worth it. The plot is sound. Yes, from start to end it is action packed. However, there is emotional depth to the characters as well. And not to forget the well timed comedy.\n\nGo watch it.\n\nRemember, this is the culmination of 10 years work and setup. It manages to hit a satisfying note. And of course please note that if you want to fully appreciate and understand this movie and the events leading up to it, you will have to watch the previous Marvel movies. Otherwise, it'll just be empty and leave you confused.\n\nCheers!",
        "After seeing people compare zsjl to this, I decided to give it a shot and didn't like it at all. It's no where close to zsjl. Period.",
        "Good build from start to the end.Still leaving a plenty of questions where we all can find out in the upcoming Avengers movie.So everyone is excited to watch it as it is going to be the biggest movie in the series. Even the movie contains big actions the movie entertained all of us with the usual humorous scenes making the movie watchable without any hesitation for all kind of fans and that is one of the main reasons for the success of the entire movie universe(according to me).All in all this mark as one of the best movies I ever watched.Well flowed from beginning to the end.",
        "Brilliant piece of direction. Each of the characters have been given proper attention and space in the movie. Thanos was brilliant. Probably the best part of the movie. Hulk was disappointing, almost reduced to a joker. Don't understand why. All other actors in the movie have done their part well. Hope Iron Man has more screen time in the next part.",
        "There was never a dull moment in this movie. It grabs your attention from the very beginning and leaves you begging for the next movie. It swirls you through every emotion, plenty of sad moments but finally the right amount of comedy in a marvel movie. The only down might be the predictability, yet it was that desired predictability. I don't think this movie could have improved in any way.",
        "What an amazing movie this has been. Looking forward to the sequel. The real snap is to DCEU",
        "The movie had a good balance between comedy and plot, and the plot was very good. Without giving anything away, the movie is marvel through and through, and yet so much more! Definitely worth the watch",
        "First of all i am not a Disney fanboy, i hated Star Wars 7 and 8 (6 and 3 on IMDB). Second i am not a Marvel fanboy, i didnt like Iron Man 3, Avengers 1, spiderman homecoming and i was upset about Black Panther. But its hard, to describe this one other than epic. These scenes, a perfect villian and the music guide you through a movie that is by far one of the best movies in the last 3 years. Yeah sure its not inception or interstellar but the movie doesnt want to be that kind of movie. Its high end action, best cgi i have seen so far and the best version of Cap, Thor etc. I have seen. Don't belive those haters, this is highly entertaining. I don't know anybody personal who has seen it and didnt love it. (Please excuse my english.)",
        "This movie had me anticipating the moment to watch the Endgame.",
        "This movie is perfect, any scene you can see in the theatre you cannot change to be better. Acting could be done way better for an absolute 10/10. I dont think there is much to say, but the storyline is the best from all of the films (Excellent Music, Great Acting, Godlike Story my final score is 9.8)",
        "Brilliantly done.. Good tone to the film from the begging to the end..",
        "I went to the cinema expecting this film to be a major flop due to the amount of superheroes were in this film. I thought there was too many how will they make this work. Well with out spoiling anything they made it work and more, easily the best film of the MCU to date",
        "I can't believe how many idiots rate this film with 1 stars...unbelievable. We are not living in the 80's or 90's and I think most of this bad rates comes from people how still think that movies from 80-90's are the benchmark for good movies. This movie will show you what the future of great films are. I watched this movie about 15 times. It's one of the best movies I have ever watched. I can't get enough of this kind of movies. This is a game changer movie...one of the best of all time for me",
        "This is my most favorite film I have watched over 15 times yet...and I'm still watching every month",
        "Cons: The effects are good, the fights are cool. Pros: The deaths of the main characters have no weight. The story is kinda dumb",
        "By the time the credits rolled, I was in tears. This film successfully brings together all of the heroes we've grown to love in the 10 years since the first Iron Man in a way that is epic, emotional, and satisfying...and all of this without it ever feeling too crowded. The tone is spot-on, with funny moments, serious moments, and emotional ones. Watch this movie as soon as you can - it is spectacular.",
        "Well it's an avengers' movie so the rate base has to be start at an 8 and all those superheroes are here with their coolest skills all in one movie, this is exciting. The images are great, the acting part is great, all the jokes from every marvel movies all comes together just make audience can't stop laughing. BUT. Admit it the logic of it is crap. I mean all avengers swore to protect lives in the whole universe that's why they are fighting the weird chin guy but somehow for the bad guy to win is simply threading their teammates? WHAT? Then what's all the efforts about?! I'm genuinely furious and speechless when they fought so hard after battle and battle then just cave 'alright mate I'll give you what you want but let him live'. They can come up with a better script than this ok? But after all it's a mind blowing film. I loved it, definitely gonna watch it agagin for all the fight scenes.",
        "The last movie I saw in theaters, was The Last Jedi, which made me think Disney is going to ruin everything I love. Thankfully, Avengers was amazing and I recommend everyone to go see it. The story is so incredible! I had some ideas about how the story was going to play out, but it was so much better then I could have imagined. It starts off strong and keeps the momentum going til the very end. In between these beautiful scenes, are wonderfully emotional moments, with the characters we have all grown to love. The most delightful surprise, were the funny moments, very similar to the humor in Thor Ragnarok. Easily my favorite marvel movie so far, but the next Avengers movie will probably be even better!",
        "While I absolutely loved Infinity War...and I do mean love, there are scenes in this movie that I have wanted to see my entire life and I was not disappointed. But with that being said I was expecting this to be the greatest movie in the MCU because it was the culmination of the 18 movies up to this point. (I still would put Civil War, Winter Soldier, Guardians, and the original Avengers ahead of it). While 9/10 was the score I give it I feel like 9.5/10 is more appropriate. There was one thing that bothered me in the latter half of movie. This is clearly was a part 1 of 2. That is where my only problem lies. This is what I Imagine will be a better version of what I think Deathly Hallows Part I was to the Harry Potter series... but to the MCU. Highly recommend it but also feels like the episode before the season finale in this big budget tv show known as the MCU",
        "Avengers Infinity war the greatest movie ever I love it so much cant explain Russo Brothers proved that they are the elite directors of this era absolutely the best of the best i mean the action in this movie is out of this world i waited for this movie since i saw Thanos at the end of the Avengers and it totally worth the wait this movie will and mean WILL drop your jaw my heart was pumping so hard three times faster than normal and i am gonna see this movie hundred times again cant wait .",
        "It's just iconic. I've got nothing to say more. RDJ, all Chris'es, Boseman's performances were great",
        "This movie is what every superheroes fan needed,it is spectacular how they mash up every single mcu movie for this moment,this Infinity war.",
        "I've grown up on Marvel comics and really thought the first Avengers was the coup de grace of comic film-then I saw Winter Soldier and Civil War. The Russo bros elevate this film so far above expectations that I cannot even fathom Endgame. Go bros and get it for Cleveland",
        "This Movie Feels Perfect from beginning to The end The Teams that Build up The Jokes everything is Amazing a Movie i whant to watch 2-3 Times in Cinema !",
        "Hi this best movie just watch don't ask everyone you know to watch it its the best",
        "Best movie of all time. Action packed awesome must watch!! Money don't matter",
        "Everything in this flim make u so excited to the next one",
        "ACTION , HUMOR , PASSION ,SUSPENSE a total package !",
        "The Movie Start Well & Ends Up Well ,, Looking Forward For The Next Avengers!! the character of thanos makes you confused in a Good way ! You Love Him & Hate Him at the same time!?",
        "I do not want to spoil this for anyone who potentially may be reading this who hasn't seen it so I will make this short. My advise is get to your nearest cinema and watch the next viewing now... also, forget everything you know, I guarantee this film will not go down how you think. They have really outdone themselves yet again, I don't think anyone saw what was coming from the trailer. It is two and a half hours of pure perfection",
        "Finally Marvel is delivering a real super-hero movie that doesn't look like a Disney fairy-tale. And what a movie. From the first second to the last, you get into the story and the action. It would have been complicated to handle so many scenes and such a big cast, but it's been done brilliantly around a solid story-line. I want to go watch it again!",
        "The best movie I've ever seen,it has a good plot,awesome characters and of course Thanos,what a beautiful cgi that I saw in the movie,just....awesome",
        "I really have to commend the Russo Brothers and Marvel Studios for this film. I can't imagine what a task it must have been to balance all these many characters and still make a good and entertaining film. That said, it's not perfect. It's a bit too long, and a a little bloated. It particularly gets a little dull in the middle. However these flaws were always going to be unavoidable for a film like this, with so many characters and tones having to mesh. That's why I say that, while the film's not perfect, it's the best it could have been. The film is quite funny, and all the jokes land. The action is great. Seeing the characters meet and interact is very fun. The highlight of the film, for sure, is the villain. Thanos is fantastic. He has a clear motivation, and real menace. Very fun film for everyone. It is definitely a part 1 though, so keep that in mind.\n\n8/10",
        "The latest addition to Marvel's onslaught of cinematic masterpieces really does its job of icing the Marvel cake. The acting and dialogue was superb, the special affects (as always) were amazing, and perhaps the best thing about this movie was its ability to NOT BE predictable. Josh Brolin's performance as the main antagonist Thanos was excellently executed and managed to get me to see things from the villain's point of view (I never do that). The other performances were as well fantastic. There is little to say in the realm of so-so for this movie, other than the fact that Endgame can't come more quickly.",
        "Was good like all advenger movies. Had good story and action",
        "It all started with Iron Man in 2008, and every subsequent Marvel film for the last decade has either contributed directly or indirectly to Avengers/Infinity War. This film has action throughout but is also heavy on story line as all the individual Marvel Tales of every preceding film converge to the epic point of conflict to a universal threat! With most characters faithfully depicted from all the movies we loved involved, this is a Journey into Mystery; the Ultimate Marvel Team-Up, with Tales of Suspense & Tales to Astonish thrown in for good measure! Two Thumbs ( both of mine ) waaaaaaaaaaaay Up !!",
        "I've been a super heros fan and marvel fan 10 years ago, it's the first time i cried on cinema while watching that movie, now i wanna watch again and again even i can't find the words to describe the greatness and the awesomeness of this movie...",
        "The movie is amazing!! It's is hilarious at parts. It is super sad at others. They did a good job incorporating all of the characters. Best MCU movie to date!! Left me speechless at the end!!",
        "This is the best movie ever lololololollololol9llllollllskskskskskskskskskskskskskskksskakakakakaka Shaka k lol I don't know why I'm so sorry to be mean and I'm gonna I was like oh my",
        "This movie is amazing, they incorporate the Thanos storyline (which is amazing). They also made the biggest crossover ever, and they made a trilogy good. I loved it, I hope you do too if you can watch this. This is definitely worth your money.",
        "I'd say that, overall, Endgame is a fun-ish movie. But I also thought that it jumped around quite a bit which made it difficult to feel immersed and connected with the characters. As soon as you started getting invested in one plot line, you were quickly whisked away to something else going on in another part of the Marvel Universe.\n\nIn addition to this, there are some odd joking moments that don't fit in well with the plot and characters and can take you out of the action if you're sensitive to those sorts of things; you'll throw out an eye roll a few times throughout this movie.\n\nBut overall, it's not a horrible movie!",
        "You may not be surprised to hear that Marvel has made another AMAZING movie. Definitely the darkest movie, but still amazing!",
        "Ever since July 2017, I've been anticipating this movie. Today, April 27th, I saw it. Every second of this movie had me completely shocked! Marvel is brilliant with every idea they come up with. Joe and Anthony Russo are so smart and they did everything the way it was supposed to be. This movie will leave you with many questions, but it will leave you wanting more. Not to mention, Thanos is the strongest villain the MCU has ever had. He's actually...Charismatic. Every single part of this movie made a Marvel fan gasp. It's THAT good. With every character that's been introduced in the MCU has a huge part in it. That's what I love about it.\n\nGo see this movie, you won't disappointed about anything. It is the best superhero movie of all time.",
        "Now, Marvel has already proven over the last decade that they can really keep surprising us and drwing us into the theatres to watch more and more of their movies. But surprises fall utterly short when it comes down to this movie. This movie doesn't surprise you with just a twist scene or an event, it surprises you with its tone. Holy Hell! From the first SECOND of the movie, literally, you could tell it's gonna be a bloodbath and a heartbreak. Real stakes? These are stakes so real you'd wish they weren't. Action scenes? This movie gives you so much epic scenes you'd get lost after you walk out of the movie on which was your favorite! And the villain? GOD DAMN, Thanos is a menace! Not best marvel villain. But one of the best villains period. The movie balances action, sadness, comedy, goosebumps, and shocking events perfectly. Easily, the best MCU movie and definitely the best Superhero movie to date!!!",
        "Althoug i dont like fantastic movies, i like this movie. It's impressed to me.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War, in my opinion, is the best movie in the Avengers universe. I was never a huge Marvel fan, I always enjoyed watching any Avengers film, but I was COMPLETELY and UTTERLY blown away after seeing Avengers: Infinity War. There's only a small list of movies that have taken my breath away after seeing them, and Infinity War is definitely one of them. From the incredible cast and character list, to the memorizing special effects, Avengers: Infinity War does not shy away from moments that make you rethink everything you have known about the Marvel Universe. One of my favorite parts about Avengers: Infinity War is the score, it really helped tie in the special effects in addition to the story-line, which contained both dramatic and comical scenes. The one thing you need to know is that the ending will truly, mess. you. up. Even if you are not a fan of the Avengers and you see this movie, you will still feel shocked. I definitely recommend seeing Avengers: Infinity War.",
        "I'm very pleased by the way MARVEL does their movies. They flow well, I feel like there isn't a huge gap in the story and everything makes sense. I absolutely loved this movie and can say that I didn't expect some stuff to happen, but it definitely did a great job.",
        "Look, the movie was really really good. I had fun watching it and it probably is one of the best MCU movies. HOWEVER. Can we consider Avengers 3 one of the greatest movie of all time ? Specially when it is just the first part of the thanos storyline !",
        "Infinity war exceeds all expectations! You need to see it ASAP.",
        "It definitely wasn't as good as a stand alone marvels movie, but it was okay. I thought bk that maybe they should have chosen different directors.",
        "One word abot the movie is OSCAR WINNING MOVIE with biggest cast assemble and with huge budget the movie is excellent",
        "This is easily my favourite film of all time, not one negative! I'm a huge fan of the marvel universe but this is different level! So much so, I thought it was better than endgame!",
        "Get ready for an emotional roller coaster though. It'll make you laugh. It'll make you cry.\n\nCast is incredibly well utilized. Brolin is absolutely marvellous as Thanos, bringing complexity to what would otherwise be a generic Marvel villain.\n\nIt's an incredible movie",
        "Being a Marvel fan myself, i was expecting a kind of Avengers movie which would literally blow my mind ( After all the Hype & taking in account the previous MCU movies). As expected, Marvel delivered yet another masterpiece. This movie will surprise even those who are not new fans of Marvel. The plot is executed exceptionally well. The costumes, certain dialogues & some occasional humour ( Yes, you read it right. Surprised, aren't you? ) they are all just FANTASTIC. Each and every character has its own role to play ( Except Peter Quill AKA Star Lord . Just Kidding) be it small or large. So many characters, still you never seem to forget any of those as they are all AWESOME in their own way (of course not as cool as Iron Man or Doctor Strange or Thor). A big thanks to the directors (The Russo Brothers), who did their absolute best in satisfying their fans (& not giving even a slightest of hint about anything in the movie during all the promotions). Guys, do watch it even if you are not a Marvel fan. The movie will not cease to surprise you time and again.",
        "Everything I hoped for and then some. Well worth the 10 year wait. I had my doubts but Thanos delivered. 10/10",
        "I might have watched it more than five times now. It is just great ....everything in it....story telling acting specially the conclusion (and many movies have failed there)... Overall maybe one of cinema best product in superhero movies",
        "Yeah ... we all know another blockbuster part xxxxxx , same special effect's and stuff. Seems the only new idea is just kill a bunch of \"super hero\" characters .\n\nTip of the day dear Hollywood masters,,,, it's boring when you see Rambo 1,2,3,4,5..... same as this , i rate it 5 - which is way to high , just because i watch it on my new TV, while i have been cooking :P Next Avengers maybe just sell as a demo to 4k TV's with HDR ? :)",
        "Alright, I'll put it straight, this is dope, the movie that I expect! Totally breaks the role of hero's journey. Actions are endless and shifting. Intense through the whole 2 and a half hours. Heartbreaking by such a tragedy in terms of some deaths are even unpredictable. The cliffhanger in the end really proves everything just gets started, and brings us curiosity and confusion. Love the way it focuses on Thanos's story line and how he kicks main characters' asses. It is still funny though, tons of hilarious dialogue and chilling among those characters still make me laugh a lot. Not gonna lie, however, this superhero movie really makes me feel the end of the world. Gun's a'blazin! Can't wait to see the next Avengers movie next year! Good job Marvel, and happy 10th birthday!",
        "It's agreat movie from marvel with unexpected end and the graphics was very good , but there is alot of comedy in some scenes require darkness",
        "This movie was perfect from start to finish. Waited 10 years for this big moment between the Avengers and Thanos. Was not disappointed. Had the perfect balance between suspense, drama, and humor. Can't wait for Avengers 4 next year.",
        "I personally love this movie because IT IS AMAZING",
        "Since the first Avengers film in 2012, I've gradually fallen out of love with Marvel films. That being said, I was told this film was a must see- how right that is! All I must say is FINALLY an ending unlike any other. If you haven't seen it yet, you're truly missing out.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War comes after a long line of previous Marvel films, and some would say that the same old formula is getting pretty exhausting. Infinity War definitely has a lot of the same formula, and still plays it safe at times, but it is definitely a step up from a lot of the previous films. Doesn't say as much as Black Panther, but still has some philosophical moments. This film also has a villain a tad more interesting than most of the bland MCU films in previous entries, and we get to understand a bit more of how he thinks. He is a bit more complex than most of the previous villains, and that is refreshing. Avengers: Infinity War was a pretty good film, not amazing, but a decent enough Marvel film in a time when its formula has been getting pretty tiring.",
        "The most ambitious crossover in history of filmmaking was well executed. Characters were perfect and the plot was well developed.",
        "Without going in to spoilers, let it suffice to say that all the bad stuff that happens in this movie is caused by the repeating stupidity and selfishness of the main cast. Every marvel movie requires a certain level of suspension of disbelief, but in their latest with they had to drastically decrease the intelligence of all good guys to make it a 'fair' match for the bed gay (singular). There was no other way to work such a big cast probably.\n\nThe main redeeming factor is the extremely well done interaction between characters from different franchises and the jokes by themselves make the movie worth watching, just don't except anything from the story.",
        "This movie concludes to the journey of mad Titan and and he is on his way to collect all the infinity stones to fill up in his gauntlet, this movie was quite brilliant and chill in the spine. Unexpected ending that no one could have predicted. My favourite three characters, being IRON MAN, THOR & CAPTAIN AMERICA got an amazing arc in this movie. While all the remaining Avengers are used suitably.",
        "10/10 no words .movie is fantastic, well direction and RDJ was superb",
        "A movie that will leave you so profoundly impacted that you will want to watch it again.",
        "Spoiler Free Review! What an amazing and epic adventure! My only regret is not seeing it in IMAX. (I probably will) Contrary to my expectations, no characters were over done and none were wasted. A great balance of the most beloved and the \"new to the show\". This film was nothing like the \"super boring and confusing\" Age of Ultron, or the \"funny but forgettable\" Guardians 2, or the \"not as great the second time around\" Thor Ragnarok. Despite its epic scale (lots of locations and lots of characters) and loose ends it had to tie up, Infinity War was surprisingly easy to follow, and totally engaging all the way through. Fun, hilarious, emotional, action packed (with lots of real stunts and not cartoony CGI), great soundtrack and totally worth seeing more than once. The directors (the Russo brothers) may have finally dethroned \"The Avengers\" as my favorite MCU movie. Civil War is a close second, also directed by the Russo brothers. Those guys were a great addition to the MCU. Fantastic film, I can't wait to watch it again and no one spoil it for anyone!",
        "One of the best of the Avengers movies. It felt like we actually dove into the the plot and lived through it with the characters on screen. Looking forward to Avengers End Game.",
        "Great film. On a par with Avengers Assemble for me. Great balance of action and humour. Can't wait for Avengers 4",
        "2018's best, the russo's have done it yet again, recommend to comic fans and anyone who knows these characters",
        "Knowingly or unknowingly the team have built a stronger and reasonable THANOS.I don't know a way to think how could they break him down in ENDGAME , if suppose happened it would be by showing much greater villain (aaw!wait he ain't a villain, right)...",
        "This movie is just a great huge movie that make us in cinema yelling and screaming for every scene. These scenes make us surprising because MARVEL transport us from a place to a very amazing one. You was able to focus in all details at same time...you can't even blink because you will miss a very important detail....Thanos was great villains because you will go with his moods in every single moment...grafics and CGI are fabulous. Finally it's a marvelous trial I will experience it agian because it was AMAZING !!!!!",
        "I had to go to the doctor after... Didn't blink once for 3 hours so my eyes wouldn't close!\n\nAmazing storyline, great interaction between the characters and probably the best movie i've seen since LOTR, about 15 years ago!!!\n\nThat's enough said...",
        "The russo brothers did a good job on managing a huge number of charecters,movie was entertaining as hell ..what they did with thanos was great but i would have love to see thanos a bit more horrific by nature and looks(the purple guy from age of ultron credit scene) with that intense character ,after all he is thanos!!anyone except ebony maw from the black order didn't looked promising. The ending was tragic but still amazing ...overall it was a great movie to watch speacially at big screen.",
        "This movie is just insane! No words! I can't wait for Avengers: endgame!",
        "This movie is just mindblowing, epic, spectacular and funny all at once!!",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is unlike anything you have ever seen and possibly will ever see! It delivers on the action, the drama, the suspense and the humour. The Russo Brothers have yet again delivered. Anyone who thinks this is not an amazing movie is talking complete nonsense. Thanos is the best villain in the history of villains. He has emotions like a normal person, yet acts like a madman. But what he's doing, he thinks it's the only way to protect the universe, that's waht makes him a great villain. Overall, I would give this an eleven out of ten if I could.",
        "The worst mcu movie I've ever seen. I really wanted to like it since it was so critically acclaimed and praised, but I think this movie is overwhelmingly overrated. I won't watch it again like I did after I watched the first avengers movie.",
        "The Avengers Infinity War Was By Far The Best Marvel Movie That I Have Seen And My Favorite Character Is WarMachine I mean His Suit Makes Him Really Beneficial And I Honestly Think They Should Use Him In Law Enforcement Criminals Would Give Up As Soon As They Saw Him",
        "I liked everything about this movie... the story was great and original.. the characters were all integrated well into the story too.. it had nice blend of emotional scenes and action... Chris Hemsworth gave one of the best performance so far of any of his movies playing Thor.. RDJ did a nice job.. the visuals were excellent... Thanos as a Marvel supervillain was fantastically portrayed by Josh Brolin.. he's fierce, menacing, and relentless... there was so much content in this movie yet it flowed perfectly from scene to scene which is not an easy feat in film making...",
        "SPOILER: This movie too many cocktail superhero character to handle. only thing i'm happy Thor got his eye back. Hulk is Scared and he don't wanna come out.. Lol, Missed whole movie with hulk character rather than first 5mnts. still don't understand how they miss Superman,batman,Donald duck and tom&Jerry in this movie. worst 3D, people were killing the time with mobile phones . this year so far my best entertainment film is Rampage after the movie everybody was clapping that how movie should be...............!!",
        "Marvel definitely came through with this one. This movie had me captured from the very beginning and it didn't fail to let go. There were different stories that all came together in such a harmonious way. So good yet sad. I stayed til all the credits were over, but I don't know what that star symbol was that Samuel Jackson was calling. 10 Stars across the board!",
        "Infinity War was incredible. It provides a perfect balance between both heartbreak and laughter. Wow.",
        "This is easily the best marvel movie to date. Thanos as a villain is menacing but still sympathetic which is one of the films greatest strengths",
        "Great movie!!!!!! Love how they brought everyone from the MCU together for this. Looking forward to Avengers 4!!!!!",
        "I greatly enjoyed this Marvel film. Might be my favorite super hero flick.",
        "You've never heard a sound like the Rubberband man\n\nYou're bound to lose control when the Rubberband starts to jam\n\nFrom the first moment Thanos appears on screen, the movie starts an emotional rollercoaster. With so many great characters there was bound to be great humor, but the Russos made a great coherent film with great story, visuals and drama.\n\nI love Infinity War, because of the great messages it brings across about friendship, setting aside differences, sacrifice, love and overpopulation. Prepare yourself for Thanos, because there hasn't been anyone like him, cause you're bound to lose control when he gets to use the Infinity Gauntlet.",
        "Yes, even better than Endgame in my opinion. Especially Thanos was insane and his win..",
        "Was such a great film! Thanos was portrayed phenomanly by Josh Brolin. All the characters had ample screen time, which I thought would be a problem for the film having so many characters. I had my mouth wide open for the majority of this film. Will definitely see it again in cinemas.",
        "The film is good for those in the age range of 9-15. Full of unreasonable action, bright colors, video and sound effects, and things that are made in studios. Lots of unnecessary characterization. Lots of unneeded drama. A melange of characters to make Hollywood richer and help it have a sequel or a threequel.\n\nIt's good for dreamers, imaginative people and those who believe in superpower and heros. Not for those who ponder, critique and look for reasonable sequences. A popcorn film to watch with your young friends, not recommended for lovers.",
        "Too many characters not enough character development.",
        "Dame , fire , best movie in the year 2018 goods ; they showed us the movie in a smooth way and everyone got what they deserve thanos got me the chills bads ; not that much so you know >>>",
        "Im not an avid Marvel movie watcher but Ive casually watched them on tv or dvd over the years, but this one topped the lot! Very impressive set pieces and banter between characters. And what an ending!!\n\nThere seems to be a lot of negative user reviews for some reason but maybe its because you need to have seen most of the previous ones and they dont know what the hells going on!\n\nI knocked a couple stars off due to the poor animation of the henchmen of Thanos, particularly the female one, her face looked like a ps3 character!\n\nIm getting this on blu for sure :)",
        "That was the best and most magnificent MCU movie I have ever seen. Bumps up to my top ten films of all time. Just right behind Logan, Avengers: Infinity war did what the justice league never could. Pull people into the story. I felt like I was there fighting side by side with Iron-man and Cap. Not once did I stare at the stupid screen in my pocket. Not once did my eyes get droopy from weariness. Not once did I go, 'they could've done that better.' Emotional, funny, action packed, perfect writing, and entertaing as all get out. Simply superb. 10/10",
        "Is it just me or Mark Ruffalo just came from downtown to shoot some scenes and went back to shoping. In some of the scenes he is holding himself barely to burst into laugh. Like shots were filmed without cuting anything with him. Really awkward performance, like he have nothing to act at all... Went too much funny and puns for his character. Thats just sums him up, rest of the movie is good, but expected more to be honest. There were many mistakes in CGI (in 20018), and saw better visuals two Avengers ago. Some part of story aren't logical and seems like there was many other ways to sort some plan/issue or whatever else. Not worst Marvel movie in past few years, far from best but at least killed 2 and half hours with it.",
        "The wait is finally over and the war is here. Infinity war is a masterpiece and marvel has once again exceeded expectations which were already set high. The movie ends on a huge cliff hanger and I can't wait to see what happens next",
        "What a Movie i didn't watch Like these type of Movie in My life. What SCREENPLAY, VFX, Editing, Everything all goes Awesome. Every Hero Intro will awesome. Climax also Awesome.\n\nWaiting for SECOND PART\n\nsoon it will come",
        "Love Thanos... I feel sorry for Thanos instead of Avengers",
        "A smash hit for fans, creepy climax and an amazing cliffhanger. What is there not to like?",
        "Be prepared to have your expectations for the film, met. And your expectations for how poorly the crowds will behave around you, dismally disappointing. This movie would be perfect if it weren't for the obnoxious fans.",
        "Wow...just amazing. I watched it almost after one month of it's release and knowing most of the stories (thanks to the spoilers) but still it was hell of a ride. The balance of acting, action, humor, casting and CGI was absolutely stunning can't blame anything. And the best part of the movie was THANOS. Whenever he appeared on the screen my heart started pounding.\n\nOne of the best movie I have ever seen undoubtably. There will be always hater who will try to prove their intelactuality but to me it was all the way fantastic.\n\nThank to Marvel and Disney for giving us 10 years of payoff.",
        "I need to start by saying this is a stunning movie. Great CGI, some really funny moments and a genuinely emotional ending.\n\nWith a movie so full of household names and established characters, I did wonder how Marvel would fit them all together and tell a solid story. They do both so very well with all the major characters of previous Marvel movies featuring heavily. Thanos was both Sinister and fearless with a few moments of weakness.\n\nGreat film, great cast and definitely needs to be watched at the cinema.",
        "Is a challenge to put together all those characters. MCU did a good job! I have seen some bad reviews here and I totally disagree. If you do not like superheroes and did not watch and follow MCU this movie can be really confused and a bit overrated. I strong recommend you to watch all MCU movies so you will have a great time.",
        "Like any other marvel movie. Formulaic in it's story and constantly interrupting it's own tone with typical marvel humor.",
        "Honestly would pay to see in theaters again. The amount of time, effort, and creativity this series has is amazing.",
        "Trailers are meant to make you want to see a film and showcase some of the best moments of a movie to draw your attention. Knowing that trailers are meant to do all of that, it has been a very long time since a movie has been 100x better than the trailer but Infinity War was just that. I was worried the film would feel rushed and generic with forced cameos but I was dead wrong. This was by far the best superhero film I have ever seen. I laughed, cried, and left the theater thinking \"what the hell just happened\"? I highly recommend anyone with the slightest love for Marvel to see this movie. You will not regret it!",
        "This movie was fantastic! By far my favorite Marvel movie! Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor we're all bada**... so was Spider-Man and Doctor Strange.\n\nHad it's serious moments and great fight scenes, definitely had its fair share of jokes and wise cracks!\n\nAbsolutely loved this movie! WAKANDA FOREVER!\n\nDefinitely kind of a Thanos Origin story.. and just so you know there IS a post credit scene, people in my theater heard there wasn't one and they left but I'm a true marvel fan so obviously I held in my urine and sat through that long list of credits and I'm glad I did!",
        "The best movie of the series yet! I just could not believe that there were so many action scenes and thrilling scenes. For the first time the emotional scenes were not stupid and just laying around. You can't expect something more from a movie of this kind. Now the bar is set really high I hope they can keep up!",
        "Im starting to say that I'm a DC fan boy, and I dont appreciate the MCU because of the \"Disney rules policy\" to interfere in every movie, but this movie went beyond far by my expectations, not what I was expecting, what a great surprise!\n\nFinally a MCU movie with great amazing villain, and the dark style story, the only movie in MCU that I loved (but I also loved the winter soldier). Thanos was my favorite character in the movie, and in a MCU movie, WuAu!! Thank you Russo brothers to not do a \"Disney\" kind movie, you take us to the other level. well done!",
        "This movie will leave you floored. Marvel means business now. This movie brings together all of your favourite superheroes and weaves them into a desperate and complex narrative which surprisingly doesn't feel strained. The Russo brothers have done it again, they made a film that brings together all of these icons yet still tells a complete, well-defined story. This film has great humour but is mainly a darker film. The situation is tense and there is a strong feeling of hopelessness. Thanos is a very strong, compelling, almost sympathetic yet ruthless villlain unlike any the Avengers have faced before. Bring your tissues people because this movie pulls no punches. The film takes all sorts of risks and there are moments that are truly heartbreaking. YOU NEED TO EXPERIENCE THIS AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE! Fantastic movie that surprised me after 18 Marvel movies of the same.",
        "So balance... funny, heroic, sad, thrilling, mysterious, savage all in one screen. Can't wait to see the next chapter",
        "By far the best Marvel movie ever! The collection of hero's and the way the split up several different story lines was done masterfully!",
        "SPOILER: This is the best AVENGERS film that came out! Can't wait to see the next part of this movie! The movie may kill some of my favorite characters when I was little but, the story came out great!",
        "Huge comic book fan. Did it go exactly like the comics? No. It's not supposed to. Excellent movie",
        "Please don't take into consideration these low iq 1/10 reviews, as no matter how the movie was most of these people would still rate it that. Their points are usually vague 'bad storytelling' I see a lot, but I can guarantee you these same people couldn't formulate a comprehensive complaint of why they didn't like the story. All and all a great movie, don't let these butt hurt imbeciles with a predetermined hatred of the MCU dissuade you, because at the end of the day it's one of the highest grossing films of all time and has an 8.9 here for a reason :).",
        "Missed a few emotional beats, but at 156 mins, there wasn't too much time to linger. Absolutely incredible film. The Empire Strikes Back comes to mind, big time.",
        "I don't know how they do it but they just keep getting better. They managed the bringing together of all the major characters really well. The CGI and special effects were awesome. The ending was on the edge of your seat stuff and has left me wanting the next instalment NOW!!\n\nBravo MCU. Bravo.",
        "There shouldn't even be anything under 7 stars for this movie. The people who hate this movie are DC biased or people who just hate superhero movies in general.",
        "I loved this movie! Having seen ALL of the Marvel movies leading up to this, I found it exciting, funny in all the right moments and also sad. It kept me entertained the whole time and when it was over I wanted more..that's the definition of a good movie. Those who said they were lost or didn't understand or it didn't have a good plot line...wtf? Are you sure you were watching Infinity Wars? Go back and watch the other Avengers, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor..etc..if you need to understand more of the story line",
        "Just go watch it if you don't like it don't talk to me",
        "Not knowing there would be a sequel, this ending trumps all endings ever. Knowledge is power, but ignorance is truly bliss",
        "~Take away the great acting and cgi and you have a movie filled with an implausible plot and too many holes.... Without the celestrials there is no way in hell to fix the problem.... The Infinity War included the entire Marvel universe but when you sell character writes to too many subparties you get a small fraction to work with.... For a director(s) to take a work they themselves never created and change not only the characters but entire storyline is absolute rubbish.... Leave the characters the way they are and the storyline the way it was written or don't make the bloody movie....~",
        "I was so excited and happy to finally see this movie and I left with wanting me. All of the MCU characters I expected appeared in this movie. The story carried with much humor and action you would expect from a Marvel movie. I give it 2 thumbs up!",
        "Marvel does justice to all the huge expectations with Infinity War. Funny as hell at times and yet super serious, this one leaves fans exhilarated, overjoyed and yet exhausted and with a lot to process after a watch. The ending leaves you desperately craving for more superhero stuff. Needless to say, the wait for Avengers 4 is going to be a REALLY loooong one. It delivers on all the hype, and then some. This is seriously essential viewing for comic and non-comic fans alike.",
        "Like other reviews, I was very impressed by the villain character depth given to Thanos. I loved the Marvel Giant Cast. Still like the original Avengers personality interplay. Then I really liked the new character interplay ( Guardians). This isn't going to overshadow Shakespeare or any other classic artistic expression. But it is pure fun, just bad guys vs. good guys, no more no less......",
        "This movie is really amazing though!! I think that this movie can get an Oscar in 2019 for sure though on this movie on what it has though!!!",
        "In my opinion, this is one of the best movies I have ever watched. I waited a long time to see this movie and I wasnt disappointed. The special effects were fabulous and the story line was amazing. The actores were great and grey did an outstanding job in portraying this characters. I recomend you this movie, specially if you love science-fiction movies.",
        "So just why was it as I believe everything that we, the fans of the Marvel Universe could ask for, we finally got to see the separate bands of heroes work together and although it was inevitable, it was orchestrated that well that we would struggle to find issues with it.\n\nEven looking at it from the view of your general film spectator it had all the key aspects you would look for in a great film from Comedy to a feeling of sadness towards characters (even thanos himself) as well as Action to Mystery.\n\nWith many critics and even fans thinking the series would struggle to sustain itself with it being such a large series of films thus far, Marvel have once again pulled it out of the bag to produce one of the best live action comic book movies of it's time.",
        "The film develops so well its plot that at any moment of it feels some moment of filling, has good moments of action, suspense and comedy, even for some people the film is cut short although it lasts about 2 hours and 30 minutes.",
        "The Infinity War has 10 years of back story leading to this, and even with the dozens of stars and characters, it managed to shine each and every character and everyone had their own time and role in the movie. It was a very ambitious project but I have to say, it did very well.\n\nThanos was just amazing. An antagonist instead of a simplistic evil villain, you simply cant hate him without feeling for him.",
        "Ohhh guys this movie is gonna blow your mind you need to go watch itt!!",
        "I prefer DC because I grew up reading Batman, Superman, Justice League so I have a hard time understanding why they were not as popular as Marvel. I just come to realize why. Marvel is made for kids, younger adults, and then you have kids that have to taken to the movie by adults. Lots of money there. DC is darker and made for basically adults. Avengers: Infinity War is a good movie, but to me it is too much like a cartoon with too much CGI and too many superheros. One thing I don't understand, with the possibility of half of the people in the universe are going to die they tried to be too funny. In the end I viewed it once but have zero desire to see it again, but see it once for sure.",
        "This is the best yet and it most definitely made history",
        "My greatest fear of endless war was as follows: 1- How are they going to gather so many heroes and make them non-disposable? 2 - how are they going to make a villain so AWESOME that it makes sense for so many heroes to come together to defeat him. And the film responded to me in the most incredible way: Each hero has his role in the plot, as are 4 jewels to be protected the film made situations for the heroes to meet and protect these jewels, and these situations are great. The villain is generic, but as the film presents us he is better able to perceive his motivations and that he is not simply generic but unique. An incredible movie with beautiful scenery, breathtaking action sequences and a script that gets better as we know the marvel universe better",
        "This movie is awesome! There's not much to say it's just a very enjoyable movie! A couple flaws for sure but the good definitely outweighs the bad",
        "Avengers Infinity War is the long awaited superhero movie that all marvel fans have been waiting for. If you have kept up with the other 17 or 18 films to date, this movie does not disappoint. Even for those who barely keep up with marvel movies will enjoy this movie do to its great storyline and rollercoaster of emotions.",
        "Marvel has started its universe in the uttermost incredible fashion with the start of Iron Man back in 2008 and continued to implement its origin stories and sequels for the next 10 years setting up an iconic film, Avengers Infinity War. This movie turned the tide of what's considered a marvel Villian and produced some staggering scenes that took courage and consistency by Joe and Anthony Russo. This was indeed a Thanos film focused more on his quest for dominance and the infinity stones. It literally felt like 3 films in one bringing over 50 characters together and actually making this work well. I have never seen a director bring so many actors together and create such a memorable masterpiece!",
        "We all know that after Thanos dies every lead character like Iron man,Captain America,Thor and Hulk will not be appearing but Spider Man, Black Panther have sequels to come but coming back to this movie Infinity war gets your seat and not an single scene where you get bogged down because every scene has its meaning which will make you love the superheroes and hate Thanos",
        "Great movie but I expect better. I didn't quite understand the 'INFINITY STONES' powers. I hope we could see more of it's use on Part 2.",
        "This film is fantastic, certainty not perfect but it is an enticing humorous film. The twist actually made me want a sequel.",
        "Comedy, action, emotional... this movie had it all enough said.",
        "Dont let these reviews fool you, this is not an exceptional new style marvel movie. its still the same old, no plot twist or major surprises. its basically the classic hero villain action movie format as always. That being said with their huge budgets they manage to cram in some really beautiful CGI and stunning visuals that will blow your mind, but the cringey humor and classical avengers ping pong interactions will not, the lame one liners and jokes are present as always which is sad being the time they have had to improve.",
        "I was greatly anticipating this film and it did not disappoint. Of course we all see the MCU big and grand which it is and then some. You literally have to be a Marvel fan to understand the story line and had to have watched all the movies to get to this point. As a movie goer you have to invest the time to fully critique it. The characters I have come to enjoy and I feel the majority of all top billed actors embody the superhero or villain persona and play it well. You can also read the comics to get an idea of where the director will possibly go next in part 2. From comic book to the big screen Disney has achieved what most studios wish they can do in the super hero arena and be extremely successful at it. Kuddos to them and I'm delighted Marvel is in such good hands. Lastly, I read some reviews on here which I carefully dissected and I've come to the conclusion they did not read comics or just not Marvel fans. I recommend reading before critiquing. Just admit it was a great film and if you were asked to take part in the next film as an extra or actor you'd raise your hand immediately. That's all!",
        "It will not be better than that ... awesome. The best movie I've ever seen",
        "I can't wait to see this again. Marvel has truly outdone itself this time. It's amazing how they tied so many hero's together for one movie. No spoilers here but I just left speechless! This movie is great for all ages!",
        "Great movie with lots of not all your favorite Hero s. But the greatest is Thanos. Never have I seen a marvel movie and felt Some connection to the villain. With all the s**t he does....he still is a character with depth. Great work from Josh Brolin",
        "No doubt I'll score this blockbuster a 9. The intensive fightings have a good rhythm and a logic without big bug. Thanos attacks each battlefield one by one and give you a good impression how it happens till the end-- though kind of vague in it. But it is exactly what the directors want-- wait for the next one!",
        "Infinity War was a great MCU film. A little anti-climactic, but had a huge cliffhanger. Going to preorder on Amazon, just because it was so good.",
        "Idk how it's got on the top 10 of IMDb list. It's not that good.",
        "Sin duda la pel\u00edcula que marca un antes y un despu\u00e9s en el UCM.",
        "This is a movie 10 years in the making. And it shows",
        "Ten years of build up paid off. Besy villain in the MCU. Generally upsetting in places. Laugh out loud moments. Amazing effects.",
        "Marvel made a full blown event the fans connected the characters what we saw in harry potter but less marvel completed his 10 year heritage this without all its characters its due to copyright the authors did a great job this superhero character is in an incredible frame but Mr Kevin Feige did this movie is full of emotional and lasting moments and especially action unexplained Thanos he is visually awesome and has a veritable goal in short unrivaled",
        "This was without a doubt the best superhero movie I have ever seen and possibly the best movie period. I have grew up alongside the MCU I seen iron man when I was 6 and have followed both the comics and movies ever since. I was sceptical, 21 movies I have loved all coming to a climatic end, I wasn't sure marvel could pull it off, but they did.... The action scenes alone where on a massive scale and outstanding to watch unfold, the character building of thanos was emotional and he kept me at the edge of my feet every time he appeared on screen next to a hero. This movie will forever be remembered and rightly so",
        "If you haven't seen this movie your mad. The ending will send chills down your spine and will see you racing back to the cinema for the sequel. The whole movie from start to finish is absolutely incredible.",
        "I just love this movie.I watched it more than 10times",
        "I was blown away by this. And i wasn't even a fan of the other mcu movies, to say the least. However the pace of IW will almost literally leave you breathless for about 2.5 hrs - it's that good.\n\nSpeaking of pace, Endgame was so badly paced that i could only give it a 1/10. It was an utter disappointment and not an action movie, that me and probably million viewers around the world were expecting after IW.\n\nAnywho, IW is by far the best action flick I've watched in years and i probably will re-watch it at least a dozen times in the years to come. 10/10.",
        "Avengers Infinity War id the 3rd movie in the series and is surprisingly better than the first two. Although that does not make this a spectacular movie. The fight scenes are great and the actors are top of the notch but this movie does not engage it's audience. Avengers 3 is a movie to watch but does not match the other top movies of the year.",
        "I think this is the strongest marvel's movie , a lots of events with no boring",
        "Avengers: Infinity War ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet, and the result is a thrilling, emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions.",
        "This movie was pretty fun I guess. Not sure I get all the hype but then again I didn't see many of the other Marvel movies. A fun time but I didn't really see anything too special about it.",
        "The threat you feel watching the film with Thanos is probably the best thing about it. You really are concerned about the ending, and the constant action and fights throughout the film makes it very entertaining",
        "Great way to set up the end I hope Endgame is three and a half hours long",
        "Amazing film. The comedy the action and the ending.",
        "This movie is one of the best of MCU. VFX are also the best and it have a great plot. It doesn't have dark shade as no of MCU movie has, it contains good jokes. Overall it is full entertainment and worth your time and money.",
        "All I have to say is this: the Russo Brothers are not good film makers and I probably won't be seeing one of their films ever again.",
        "This movie definitely does not disappoint. Marvel in general always does such a good job and has the perfect balance between action and storytelling. I have a strong connection to every character in this series and thats a very special thing to have for an action movie.",
        "I was extatic through the whole movie! Had to see it 2 times in the cinema!!! Thors moment was..... explosive!",
        "Best Marvel movie ever!!! Ever!!!! I love that movie. Everybody must see that masterpiece!",
        "Well made movie bringing together last 10 years of MCU , well written and directed.",
        "Epic and awnsome movie, can't wait to watch avengers 4",
        "Great movie with awesome character the only bit that I give it's the jumping between scenes",
        "It is the best movie among avengers ..infact I consider it best movie of MCU",
        "Just Go watch this,It's just like any other marvel movie,Endgame and Infinity war are the best So Go watch it Before watching Endgame!!",
        "Non stop action as Thanos gets all Stones. In my opinion the best avengers movie.",
        "I went in expecting with all the memes there were going in, this was gonna be bad. I was never a fan of superhero movies, but this movie was amazing in all ways possible. I almost cried at the end. 9/10",
        "My favorite of all time. Terrific action and in depth in all it's characters. This film should be recognized more for it's theatrical achievements and not only it's monetary ones.\n\nYou can never go wrong with the Avengers and I can't wait to see what they do after Endgame.\n\nA film for everyone, not just comic fans.",
        "This movie did no fail to astonish and was definitely worth all the hype!",
        "If i sit the keyboard, i could create a better scenario for sure bruh.",
        "This movie is way better than the last Avenger's movie. The story and action are superb.",
        "A trash CGI movie full of super heros with poor story that might be enjoyable for toddlers and kids.\n\nIt's the same as previous ones, don't waste time and money.",
        "This is a non-spoil review. After watching this movie: I felt like I was going to have an asthma attack and my heart kept racing even an hour after the movie ended. This movie is so emotionally fulfilling that I want to see it AT LEAST a couple more times. Do not wait for DVD to see this, this movie DEMANDS to be seen on the silver screen.",
        "The movie is the best MCU movie i have ever watched. I mean there were times in the movie that were a little long driven but that doesn't matter because the movie was just so good.",
        "Anyone that has anything bad to say about this movie is a Sap.",
        "A great fitting to10th anniversary of MCU. The plot line, the editing, the pacing etc. Just mind blowing!!!!!\n\nMust see.!!!\n\nEven I was a D.C. fan",
        "Best movie ever and the story is awesome..........,...............",
        "Great movie, best Marvel film yet. Thank you for not being predictable like all the haters seem to want",
        "Congratulations to everyone who worked for this film. Thank you for making the best Superhero film we've seen till now. At last, a film with real screenplay, direction, characters, emotion, action, CGI, humor, fun, entertainment that keeps you locked inside the screen from the first moment to the last. I hope and wish the next Avengers film to be also that good.",
        "I just left the theater about an hour ago, and all I can say is that I am stunned by this incredible and impossible movie. What Marvel has done with this Universe and the stunning way in which the events have led us to this event is simply mind blowing. The first ten minutes alone offer more heart and dread than nearly all of the other movies combined. Infinity War will leave you as broken as the Avengers. The guts that it took to write and create this movie is immeasurable. I simply cannot believe what I just saw. Staggering.",
        "Maybe my failure to follow MCU movies from the beginning is the reason why but I felt that there were way too many stories happening in this movie (they almost felt random) and they didn't make sense / didn't work for me. My husband actually fell asleep early on in the movie.",
        "My apologies to all the fans but in my old man opinion this was not the movie that the hype led me to believe. Yes the \"effects\" were amazing and most of the jokes funny but other than that it seemed so predictable as to be boring. Again this is just the opinion of a grandpas that heard his grandsons talking about how amazing and at the same time sad this movie was. I believe that for someone to truly enjoy this epic, they would have to invested a large amount of time learning and watching this genre would have gotten much more out of this movie. As just entertainment it did not do the job for me. My sincere apologies again to all the fan boys and girls, this show just did not hit the spot.",
        "Juggling a wide array of characters from 18 different movies, across a 10 year span, Avengers: Infintiy War delivers on all cilindars. Marvel has once again taken a seemingly impossible task, and proved they can handle anything thrown their way. Each character gets their chance to shine during the runtime, and although there can be clashing tones, the movie never loses its audience. For a common movie fan who hasn't followed the marvel movies, you may be lost. The movie contains no character development, and it doesn't have to, as we've been developing these characters for 10 years. It's fun to see characters you known thrown into situations and forced to interact. This movie is a great time, and any fan of the marvel movie will be happy with it. I don't anyone needs a recommendation, as you already know if you will be seeing it.",
        "This movie is unlike any other Marvel superhero movie. It's full of interesting details and the result is totally unexpected.",
        "If you're a fan of the Marvel genre this will tick all the boxes for you. After 10 years & countless movies, all your favourites are brought together almost seamlessly. Within the first five minutes of the film you're shown that the stakes are high & that with impending contracts due to expire within the cast, you could be forgiven to believe that your favourite is safe. The movie plays out for the better part of 3 hours & for the most part it shall demand your attention, your reward? the cruelest of cliffhangers, for which you won't receive closure for another year.",
        "Why would I choose a review title like that? Because the movie brought so much emotions out of me that no movie has ever even remotely managed to do. Thanos has become my favorite villain of all time. Will watch it again.",
        "After seeing the reviews of most ppl, i went to this film with very low expectations but honestly it was a great surprise, a very shocking mind blowing and kinda unexpected ending ( i just sat there for 10 minutes trying to process it )... Don't listen to the haters and definitely don't let them spoil you...",
        "The Russo brothers did it again! I was blown away by this movie. Every character had their screen time and interactions between them were very good. As a huge fan of Spider-Man I can say that the Iron-Spider suit in the movie looked awesome. Thanos is probably the best marvel villain and the CGI looked on point. Overall this might be the best MCU film up to date!",
        "Hands down the best Marvel movie Yet. So much to see and take in. Stories woven together in fine style. Visually a delight to watch.",
        "An emotional roller coaster from the get go. This movie provides the same humor and action that we have become Accustomed to but this time with heart wrenching storyline. My jaw was wide open when the credits rolled and I sat there in disbelief. A must see for the true Marvel fan and also the casual watcher.",
        "Besides the first GOTG movie, this really is the best Marvel has had to offer. They finally found the perfect mix of action, humor and everything else that they had pieced together through all their other films. Worth every penny and probably worth a second watch.",
        "I don't normally review movies but seeing this at 16 on Top 250 is severely heartbreaking.\n\nThis does injustice to movies like Matrix, Gladiator, Seven Samurai, Goodfellas, City of God, Se7en, Silence of the Lambs, The usual Suspects, Spirited away, Pianist, Whiplash, Departed, Prestige, Memento, Apocalypse Now, Django Unchained, Wall-E etc. which are multiple times better than this CGI laden story for kids that took 10 years in the making.",
        "I like this type of movie but would have liked it a lot more if I didn't have to keep turning the volume up and down because the music is louder the talking. Maybe it works in a theater but for watching it at home volume could be balanced out considerably more. I'm writing this as I watch it. I've gotten to the point where they arrived at Nidavellir and I thats where I had to stop watching.",
        "I'm a marvel fan, have been since day 1 and I can conclude that this film was simply the best it could have been! Every element you could think of, the cast the acting the CGI, cinematography, editing, it's all extraordinary in this movie to the point that marvel fans are most likely ecstatic about like I am! Everything we were hoping for and more was in this movie. Best MCU movie!!\n\nP.S Thanos is by far the best comic book movie villain of all time exceeding that of Heath Ledgers joker which I never thought would be possible but I'm anyone can do the impossible in cinema it's Marvel!",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is an unrelenting thrill ride of action-packed spectacle. Thanos is easily the best antagonist of the MCU, with genuine moral depth and intimidation (Ebony Maw is also a stand-out). Many characters shine brightly in this film, while others are wasted or used poorly (at least in the theatrical cut). The screenplay has a few problems with exposition, logic and a few tonal shifts. Alan Silvestri's score is incredible, the 2.5 hour running time felt shockingly quick to my pleasant surprise, and the ending is powerfully impactful. Avengers: Infinity War is nevertheless an overwhelming and ambitious blockbuster extravaganza that is the beginning of an even greater culmination for the MCU.",
        "Brilliant!!!! Finally a genuinely movie! Little darker, more like the Comics and not such a stupid Slapstick movie like Thor:Ragnarok. Great Great movie!!!!!",
        "Yes, this is a superb movie. So many characters\\heroes and still managable. Thanos as villain perfect. He has reason, not just a dumb evlil nobody. Good job. I wish Endgame was that cool as this movie.",
        "I was so excited about this movie and it didn't disappoint.",
        "Boring. I was in the cinema and bored. Want a refund. I prefer Batman",
        "I loved this movie from start to finish! I can't wait to go see it again!",
        "I love the film, marvel comes with it again. Thanos makes everyone look like his kids. Avengers rock in here.",
        "The best marvel movie so far a villain with good argemento good balance of characters good fight scenes good special effects good sound theme very entertaining",
        "All I gotta say is, if you haven't seen GO!! This is one of the best Marvel movies made yet! Go, Go, Go!",
        "I did not grow up reading comics but I have certainly enjoyed a lot of what Marvel has developed over the past 10 years. Some misses, in my opinion, but no one does superhero movies/television better than Marvel.\n\nAll of that to say, Infinity War is near perfect and is the best Marvel Studios production, thus far. It is incredible and should be a contender for Best Picture and Best Director(s) the next awards ceremony cycle.\n\nI cannot wait to see this again!",
        "If I would have chance t vote twice I would vote for thanos character, Strong appearance even he's quite.. Don't talk much, if he do so, straight to the point.. Emotional but strong physically and mentally.. He knows what he's doing..\n\nLove that kind of characters . I assume thanks would be same in next part..",
        "10 YEARS OF BUILD UP TO THIS. BEST MOVIE EVER PERIOD",
        "I loved this movie and I saw it twice in the cinema. It was the third movie to make me cry. The other 2 were Wonder Woman and Love, Simon if that gives anything to go by. Good movie would recommend.",
        "Awesome! The way they developed the story, the way heroes worked together, the comedy component, and the unpredicted end... for me is a 10",
        "That's a lot of action, but good action, never too boring. I felt strange, unease about this movie, because unlike my expectations the story and some images remained in my memory long after having watched it. That is a total different dimension compared to the 2 previous movies: I could not watch them completely stopping after 30 minutes. These 2 remains in the shallow waters, the deepest philosophy is about why Iron Man has lost his mask... I started to analyse why this third one is different, and basically this is simply because it bring me back in my youth, Moses, the story of prophets that have changed the face of the world, and ancient greek stories, and realised that the big picture of this movie is nothing different... As the bible is not my preferred book, this film is deeply rooted in my feelings and despite it is not my preferred movie of all times, it is definitively a great one.",
        "If you haven't seen this movie yet idk why you're reading this, Go see it if you haven't, seriously go",
        "Its good bit i dont feel so good.............................................................................................................................",
        "Loved it! It had everything- humor, great effects, Thor, drama and did I mention Thor? The pirate/angel man!",
        "Best movie ever. If u have seen it, u know exactly how I'm feeling. If u haven't seen it, GO SEE IT! Best movie!",
        "This movie is the definition of epic, I have never in my life seen a movie as good as Avengers IW!!!!! Go see this movie ASAP!!!",
        "I've seen a lot and I mean A LOT of great shows/movies in my lifetime so I'm at the age where I NEVER ever watch something twice. I usually just watch a movie and then never see it again because I like to watch the new stuff! But THIS MOVIE!....\n\nWas the first movie that I've watched more than one time in a looooooong time!\n\nIt lived up to the hype. People was telling me how good it was so I had HIGH expectation. There are like 18 movies that lead up to this movie and they did a teaser trailer like 5-6 years ago so my expectations were big and...\n\nIt didn't let me down!\n\nI still don't know why some people would give this a bad rating.",
        "Incredible.If Avengers was the first successful comic book team-up movie, then Infinity War is the first successful live-action comic book event. This movie achieves exactly what it set out to do, and with so many characters in play, it is an absolute miracle it is not a complete mess. When taken as a stand-alone movie, it probably doesn't deserve this score and the same is true if you aren't fully invested, but as an MCU fan, I really can't give it any less. I don't think there has been another movie quite like it.",
        "The movie is a mess. To many characters, a terrible storyline, it's a mess. This movie is only for kids and die-hard fans.",
        "It's the most ambitious piece of storytelling in the 10 years since its inception",
        "This movie is better / as good as the previous MCU movies. at the time of my reivew the average of 300,000 reviews is 8.8 which is crazy! who would rate it 1 or 2 start? XD haters and jealous people who can follow the storyline or not interested at all!",
        "I am not a super hero movie kind of person but this is absolutely amazing. So well put together great character building humor and all around awesome.",
        "Movie is awesome. Far far bettter than DC. The climax is way beyond our thoughts.",
        "NO SPOILERS - Good to read before the film\n\nThis movie is almost everything. Thanos has a great back story and you almost feel sorry for him. Action is very epic with a lot of great shots and great continuety. Also great to see all of the heroes work together. Doctor strange is a big part of that. The battle sequences make the adrenaline in your body floating out like water. At Some points it feels a bit overpacked and Some scenes are brief, but you only realise that after the film. This is a MUTCH WATCH experience especially in iMax beacaise of the enormous screen and banging sound you feel the tense in every single bone of your body.",
        "This movie did everything, what superhero movie should do. I love the third act and every action scene. Some characters didn't get much screen time than others, but hey thats understandable, because in this film there are so many characters. This movie gets 10/10",
        "This movie was and is a big game changer for MCU. Avengers Endgame needs to be more than perfect.",
        "So much fun to watch....I wanna see it again ASAP! Also, they did a fantastic job making a story with so many superheroes.",
        "This movie was Amazing ! i actual think this is the best movie i have ever seen.",
        "After the over-hyped disappoint that was Blank Panther, I now get why BP was important. Thor 3 was so much better than BP, but again, important.\n\nInfinity War starts with a bang and just doesn't let up. It has all the right snippets of comedy, tragedy, and some very unexpected moments. We finally get Thanos and understand why he is who he is and what he's after. All the MCU movies are tied in and, for me, there were a couple characters that showed unexpectedly!\n\nThe film ends with a great cliffhanger and you need to wait until the VERY END of the credits.\n\nIf Infinity War doesn't bypass Black Panther in gross sales, then there's a conspiracy at foot!!",
        "Amazing. I love and hate it with all my heart. Tom Holland's acting is out of this world. 10/10 Definitely would let it destroy my life again.",
        "Having dodged spoilers for the past few days, I finally saw Avengers: Infinity War today. Let me tell you, it BLEW ME AWAY! I've been a Marvel fanboy since I was a kid and this is one of those movies you see and then just play moments over and over again in your head. You may think with all those stars and heros in there that things can get a little messy and confusing and the Russo brothers sorted it all out perfectly. I'd say the real star would have to be Brolin as Thanos. The presence commanded by him in every scene he's in is amazing! The way you see this shadowy character unfold over 2 1/2+ hours is something I had yet to see in another Marvel film. There are surprises you don't see coming, the trailers did a great job at not giving anything away so be prepared to scoop your jaw off the floor when it ends. Definitely leading up to part 2 as there's A LOT left hanging when everything wraps up and that post credit scene rolls.",
        "This is best movie i ever seen... I can't find words to say about it",
        "It's fun to see many characters together that are favorites. Some are downright surprising to see together. However, there is not enough time to develop a specific storyline for your favorites. I found the ending weird and did not understand how the script writers came to that conclusion very well. That could've been developed better (and lessen some of the action scenes to do so). Still, a worthy movie to see.",
        "It movie is really good. Its graphics are really unexpectedly great. I never so any movie like that , I saw in IMAX and that experience is really good.",
        "I saw most comments condemning this movie. So dark! Are you sure, you're not from DC universe?",
        "This is one of the best movies of all times, wow CGI, funny, unpredictable story yet believeable.\n\nit's like i remember the first time when i watched Avengers 1 but even more better.\n\nbravo to Russo brother, it did live up to the hype.",
        "I'll keep this short.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War is amazing and is a must see. It stands the second best superhero film right behind The Dark Knight. It is intense, sad, and Thanos is one of the best villains I have ever seen on the silver screen.\n\nIn short, go see it.",
        "A perfect beginning of the end for the previous phases of the MCU. For 10 years Marvel has been carefully building their universe and all of the movies led to this moment. It triggered so many emotions that I've lost count. Perfect action scenes, characters, visuals and so much more. I dare to say, without a doubt, that this is the greatest superhero movie of all times. 2019 and Part II can't come soon enough. All that's left now is wait for the denouement and introduction of new characters, and new stories that come along with them.",
        "Such an epic film with so much depth and emotion. Incredible cgi, cast and story. Epic from start to finish, this film gives you the best conclusion to 10 years of mcu films and leaves you speechless by the end. Props to The Russo Brothers on making a film with so many characters work and giving us an outstanding Marvel film.",
        "With a snap and it becomes #1 movie in the mcu. Can't wait for the sequel",
        "A must see blockbuster that will make you laugh, shocked, silent, and tear up!",
        "A movie that is riddled with drama and love story plot device that enforces the character to act stupidly. Any and all props in the movie is overshadowed by the poorly developed character Thanos.",
        "Was it worth the hype ? Yesss . This movie hit all the notes perfectly with some jaw dropping action scenes and wonderful acting. Beautifully directed movie by the Russo brothers. Each and every scene had a meaning to the movie and doesn't let you get bored . I have seen this movie twice and i liked it more the second time. Ending was .... interesting and gets you hyped for the next movie. Looking forward to the next one. Yes , this movie is definitely worth your time !",
        "I just have to say, everyone giving this movie a 1 or 2 star rating either A: Didn't see the movie at all. or B: went in to see the movie, and was already determined to give a low rating before the previews started rolling.\n\nWhile this movie is not perfect, It was indeed a very well made movie, with the actors doing a top notch job as can be expected from the marvel cast. The story was very good and kept me engaged, and finally answered the question of why Thanos wanted all these shiny stones. Also I felt some sad emotions with some of the events, but I will not describe them as to not spoil the movie.",
        "This movie was a masterpiece. I haven't seen such a good movie in such a long time. Avengers Infinity War exceeded my expectations. I was expecting an awesome movie filled with superheroes, but what I got was arguebly the best superhero movie to date. Every ounce of the way there is action. There is comedy. You will even cry. The end is near, and you should go watch.",
        "I was expecting more and it turned out bad and annoying so much jokes i was like it is the end of the world guys not a stand-up comedy but at least i enjoyed Thanos character.",
        "First of all, don't spread unfair hatred because of your love for DC. I love both of them to death and if you are a real fan then you will love this movie. now the review: I felt the same amazement when i watched the Avengers 1, you wont realise where your time went. It is entertaining, engaging, has a good story and actually makes you feel for the villain. Thanos is a worthy villain who actually has a motive which even you will agree at some point. the cgi is amazing, it feels so real. the movie is less funny than other marvel movies and i thank the russo brothers for that. In the end it just makes you wanting for more. my personal guarantee that you would love it.",
        "If these are truly to be the last 2 Avenger movies, then the Russo bros have saved the best for last. For me, this movie is on par with The Dark Knight when it comes to the villain, the magnificent story telling throughout and the epic climax at the end. Well done sirs!",
        "Movie was the Bomb! The best MCU film to date and the definition of the perfect comic book movie! Thanos is the best villain that's ever been presented on the silver screen and the movie managed to juggle multiple plot lines and characters with ease!",
        "Avengers: Infinity War does an incredible job of melding together many storylines and characters into a beautifully intertwined story that's not even hard to follow. It does everything previous MCU movies have done, but on a much grander scale. The villain Thanos is especially compelling and has really done justice to all the times he's been hinted at since Avengers Assemble. This movie has it all - sci-fi, drama, fantasy, comedy, and action, so I'm sure all audiences will like something about it. The acting was pretty good across the board but since everyone had limited screen time (even in such a long movie!), what really stood out to me was the amazing visuals, and of course, the very long story arch finally coming near an end. The ending is also exceptional, but I won't speak much about that. Overall, I can't wait for the next ensemble movie and can't recommend this one enough.",
        "Amazing movie. I have enjoyed ever single moment of this movie. Every single cast member has done a really great job. Itsa fine work by the Russo brothers. Hatsoff...",
        "It is a very rare occasion feeling like you wish something must be done so the protagonists beat the antagonists in a film. When I watched this, I hoped the Avengers solve this huge and problematic villan they have to defeat. The one that will make them lose all hope just like I felt. And I put all this trust and hope in them. This feeling of imcompletecity and this desire the viewer gets is like nothing before. We seek to see the true heroes they are and how they can succeed in this seemingly impossible victory. Along with this, we have good characters, each with it's memorable and distinct personality, and they all go along well in the story. Accompanied with nice humor and with great action scenes that show unique powers and fights scenes that you even interrupt yourself while eating popcorn",
        "Marvel's Fans are going to love this movie, moreover Thanos' fans. This is the story of the Great Titan, the Mad Titan, and how he get all Infinity Stones.\n\nI'm pretty sure that Endgame is going to be way better, but this was a MASTER PIECE.",
        "This movie somehow has the ability to keep you entertained for nearly three hours, but it has its problems. As good as the story and villain are you can't ignore the elephant in the room, you need to see nearly every marvel movie to understand what is going on. Thankfully if you have seen enough marvel movies to understand the plot you will be treated with a fantastic and dark story with a great villain! Just if you haven't seen a marvel movie and want to watch this, don't. You won't enjoy yourself. If you have this will be to you one of the best movies of the year up to this point",
        "Again Marvel has done it again. There's no denying it, it's a must watch. Better and bigger than the first two Avengers. Can't wait for the 4th installment.",
        "Whatever the opposite of a an audience full of happy clapping people is.",
        "The movie is too good. Hats off to the star cast of the movie, marvel, Russo Brothers, Stan Lee and Kevin",
        "I am a marvel fan. I have seen all the movies several times. I know the lines by heart. I even grew up seen the tv shows and this movie was just too much for me. It was perfect. The chemistry between the characters is amazing, and the Russo brothers were able to make enough screen time for more than 20 characters. The fights are amazing and Thanos is just the greatest villain in the MCU by far. I loved every second of the movie... but that final was just wrong. That was not supposed to happen!!",
        "This movie is awesome..hats off to Russo brothers to give such a wonderful movie. The action is great, the acting is great and the THANOS is way good and the best villain in MCU...Hats off.",
        "Loved every scene of this movie. Great comedy, rollercoaster of emotions and an unbelievable cliffhanger at the end!",
        "Interesting through out the entire movie! One of the best movies I've ever seen.",
        "I went to see this movie over this weekend and let e tell ya it was brilliant i laughed i almost cried there was a rush of action and plenty to keep you entertained i totally reccomenmd seeing this movie i only caution sencitive folks that some parts are rather sad but as for everything else i say go see this movie solid ten out of ten",
        "Honestly the movie exceeded every expectation I had going in! It made me laugh, cry, almost jump out of my seat! The visuals in the movie are incredible as well, thanks to the top notch art direction! Movie definitely kept me on the edge for the whole thing!! Hats off to Marvel Studios and the whole crew for making an epic! Loved every second of it! Going to see it two more times this week!!",
        "Is a movie of a master villain with the characters that have been built up for the last 10 years. So for those saying there is a lot of fight... Please read the title again... Is a war. Awesome movie full of action. Some character development but absolutely up to the expectations. If you want to see an amazing story with a beautiful image and nice sunsets in France please don't go watch this and save the time taking avoid how to shoot a proper movie.",
        "MCU has proved once again that they are capable of exceeding everyone's expectations creating a masterpiece! The way they succeed to work out with so many characters is unbelievable! Best movie ever! Congratulations!",
        "I wasn't quite sure at first with them all in the same movie but they really managed to pull it off and it's probably the best Avengers movie I've seen yet and can't wait for 2019 for part two to be realeased as it was heart wrenching for me at the end and was left on a cliffhanger. But would definitely recommend to go and see it and would of quite happy re-wanted the film moments after it ended!!",
        "This movie is everything and more of what we fans waited for. Not many movies make you feel bad for the antagonist, but this truly did. Amazing plot. Amazing story. Amazing way to top the check board that has been rising for years and years. Marvel, you have done it again!",
        "You can see the diference between a good movie witch is this one and a less good movie.You have everything in this movie.",
        "10 years later and it didn't disappoint one little bit!! Love it!!!",
        "Really good, wasn't bored at any point, if your a marvel fan this movie is a must see",
        "Seeing all these characters interacting with each other on the big screen was such an amazing experience. I grew up with these characters and they hold q special place in my heart. This film isn't perfect but it's very entertaining. Not to mention this is the first time since Loki i felt that marvel fleshed out and have a real sorry to their villain.",
        "1. Story brilliantly written and executed but some where things were not explained in rush 2. Actors in particular josh brolin, Rdj, chris hemsworth are good 3. Vfx are good but when looked in 3D somewhere it lookes blurred 4. Humor is wel placed and not wasted 5. Overall movie is good and outstanding in case of performance",
        "This movie is far better than Justice league. This Movie's storyline was awesome and the characters deaths were so emotional. I hope they return in Avengers 4",
        "Literally the greatest movie I have ever seen. Start to finish it was epic. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I seriously cannot wait to go again",
        "Went to see this movie tonight and the people in the theater were applauding!!! It was awesome! A must see!!!! Loved every minute.",
        "Simply the best movie I've ever seen!! Need to watch it at least 4 more times!",
        "Awesome, just awesome! I especially liked the special effects...",
        "Best movie from Marvel! Can't stop watching it. Just Brilliant!",
        "Pure comic book masterpiece The way Thanos was performed by josh Brolin was amazing",
        "Action packed, has it's little jokes to make you laugh, apart from that. Would make this a film to go and watch if you are a big marvel fan. One of the best films of the year so far I've watched and the best marvel film to date.",
        "This is what i want to see in a comic movie! action from beginning to end and lots of epic moments.",
        "Best movie yet The first 2hr 30min movie that actually flew by due to its captivity",
        "The film was amazing lived up to the hype and exceeded it at some points! The beginning instantly impressed me and I thought it would get worse but it just didn't it was amazing throughout!",
        "If you don't like superhero's or the Marvel stay home, But if you lived the story through the previous 10 years, you are going to Enjoy this! It's a rollercoasterride with big fights epic moments and great Humor! Loved it from start to end! Can't wait for part 4",
        "This is the strongest movie in a cinematic universe full of great films. As the title says, it is simply incredible, a must see.",
        "It was very good. I really enjoyed it. Honestly, I don't have much to say. I just want the IMDB fan rating to be high because the movie is worth seeing and certainly worth being on the top 10 list. Hopefully this will sustain!",
        "The first thing that i will say is that if you dont see this movie in the theatre you will regret it because this will go in history as one of the best movies ever made. The characters,the visuals,the action are all top notch. Thanos is the best MCU villain and probably the best comic book villain aswell. The ending of this movie alone deserves an Oscar. Go see it ASAP Because trust me you dont want to get spoiled.",
        "I have never seen such a great or powerful movie in my lifetime . Bravo Marvel.",
        "This movie is a reward for everyone who follows the mcu movies since the first iron man. This movie can be a one big mess for people that never watch the previos movies of marvel, but if you do you will enjoy every second of this film it has great action and great story and one of the best villans every put in a comics book movie, and the ending is very brave and I never saw a film that end the way infinity war ended and I just can't wait for the second part. I saw the movie 3 times in the cinema and it was a great experience. Definitely 10 out of 10. *My first review on imdb*",
        "I just finish to watch all series of avengers and i can say all series is so good especially Infinity wars dan Endgame",
        "I went to see this film on 26th April and had my mind blown! Directors have absolutely knocked it out of the park with the writing, screenplay and special effects. Performances were amazing, especially Josh Brolin, who actually did the impossible making the villain likable. This is an amazing culmination of 10 years of MCU movies. Extremely excited to see Avengers 4",
        "\"Avengers Infinity War\" arrives, after 10 years. Everything the fans wanted to see is here, from grand battles to exciting moments. Finally seeing all the characters built over so long is rewarding. Thanos is scared and powerful, becoming Marvel's best villain. Stop what you're doing and go see \"Infinity War\" is a very fun and epic experience, and the end will leave everyone waiting for Avengers 4!",
        "Inconsistent film, it only represents a great marketing campaign, passenger, it is not something that remains in memory.",
        "Thanos is best villain ever. Action is famous. Battles are amazing. Wakanda forever.",
        "When I saw Iron Man for the first time in theaters , I was a kid who just discover Comic books and I would never thought , 10 years later , a movie like Infinity War were going to happen . This movie is like a combination of Comic book fan dreams : The crossover and the multiples interactions between characters , The gigantic battles , the surprise and the vilain ( Josh Brolin is clearly MVP here ) but if you are a bit of a cinephile , you might be disturbed by the direction who are not very great if not terrible , or some lazy writing or some characters development . Even with these problems , Infinity war didn't disappoint and is by far one of the best MCU movies",
        "This film is way better than endgame. The actions are better, the writings better the dialogues better and better the cgi is better More shocks. Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored. The movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time and I'm definitely very excited.",
        "From the very start the movie shows that there are high stakes by getting rid of characters straightaway. It contains some great jokes and action, and at times engenders emotional depth... however when the film finishes I felt that it wasn't really a full movie, rather just another \"part 1\" with a weak cliffhanger. The risk that this movie runs is that if it revives most of it's characters in the next Avengers (which is likely) the movie becomes redundant. Still though, would recommend.",
        "In my opinion this movie was what all Marvel fans wanted.Great action scenes,maybe the best villian,great story arc and great ending. I think that if someone likes marvel will love this movie like i did.",
        "Just amazing, greatest superhero movie of all time. I love it",
        "This movie is a perfect example of executing of all built formulas for 10 years and 18 movies till Ragnarok. If this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 rating then other superhero movies would have deserve 1/10, not because of they are bad, but to make a clear difference between infinity war and other superhero movies. The delivery of the movie was better than a marvel fan expections. You just can't put your eyes from the movie for 2:30 hours. Infinity war is not only a complete package of actions, but also a mixture of fun, joy, emotions and heart breaking incidents. Whoever didn't watch the movie I will suggest them to watch it but only after watching the previous movies otherwise he/she will not get the same taste.",
        "If you like Marvel movies, like I do, then this includes everything you'll love about Marvel, and something new, gravitas. I was skeptical if they were going to be able to balance the sheer number of heroes, but man, I was wrong. Am definitely going to see it at least 2 or 7 more times.",
        "Great film that I throughly enjoyed throughout with great action scenes, CGI and even great jokes. But what I loved most of all was Thanos and that he really had character and actual emotion and I could really see the story from his point of view unlike most other villains in films theses days that are just megalomaniacs or blood thirsty antagonists.",
        "THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!! Russo brothers have done exceptional job. Everything thing, every piece, every character was used so perfectly that it created Exitement of what will happen next. And I can't wait to see part II.",
        "Waste of time. Didn't understand Whether Thanos is Hero or the Averages. I think the Storywriter is himself confused.",
        "For Marvel fans it's 4.5 out of 5. Otherwise 3.5/5. Expect the unexpected. Do watch previous Marvel movies.Effects are fantastic. Movie is hilarious, thrilling, emotionally pleasant and full of action. Actually a Thanos movie who proved to be the badass villain yet. Ending is unexpected but unique as it should be. Overall, a must watch MASTERPIECE by Marvel.",
        "Yeah, it's pretty good. I would say watch it before spoilers. Your welcome.",
        "Everything was leading up to this and it was mesmerizing",
        "You will go through a full cycle of emotions, this is not one to miss.",
        "Everything about this film was perfect, except that it confirmed the crappy Captain Marvel movie. If you read any of the original Infinity Gauntlet comics, this was as true to them as it could be in the MCU and I was extremely happy with it.",
        "Excellent comic book movie, perfect escapism.\n\nAll the 1/10 scores are either DC fan boys who hate that Marvel dominates movies (personally I love both franchises and wish DC could deliver better movies) or movie snobs who hate the fact that another big popcorn movie is making loads of $ and getting good review scores.\n\nIf you liked other marvel films you will love this.\n\nGreat action Great characters Great effects Emotional depth cliff-hanger ending",
        "Absolutely incredible film, I was left shook when leaving the cinema. This is a must watch.",
        "This movie is marvel at its absolute best. It strikes a perfect balance between humor and tensions. The last moments in the movie left myself and the entire theatre absolutely speechless. I was in tears during many parts of this film. Josh Brolin gives a fantastic and entrancing performance as Thanos. I found my attention consistently captured on Thanos in every scene he is in. Chris Evans, Robert Downy Jr. and Chris Hemsworth gave phenomenal performances as well. The entire cast was at their best. However, Tom Holland was the one whose performance moved me the most to tears. Overall, this movie is amazing. The pacing and story are balanced perfectly (as all things should be) and cast is inamitable. This movie is one for the history books.",
        "Haters can try and bring this film down but this is a breathtaking movie which has been perfectly executed...and the fans know it. Thanos is the greatest villain in superhero movies. The action was truly epic. The film had heart, emotional involvement and well timed humour.\n\nThe greatest superhero film yet made. Seriously, how did they pull this off?",
        "This movie has lots of action +.good content and nice graphics but you should make the next villain in the next avengers movie should have a special power.",
        "Possibly the greatest movie i have Ever seen...yes you need to see the previous films all 18 of them, but this really is start to finish an epic film. And best part is...it's not over",
        "Hype was real. Its even better than I expected. Nuff said ... 10/10",
        "This movie knows how to do serious moments. And comedic moments. They put together a truckload of characters and it somehow works. Really well.",
        "A great addition to the superhero genre but does help to know the previous films first. I'm not sure why other reviews are so negative, I would just suggest watching it. It kept me entertained.",
        "I was so hyped for it and I wanted to have the full experince so I went to IMAX and it WAS like a dream true, the hype was real and so amazed by the what the Russo brothers had accomplished on making a new adventures for every characters and they were all conected together by their own hands and letting the evil Thanos to get through and destroying their world, Thanos was their most fear that came true on ways they never imagined, everything was perfect the music the sense of humor even when it gets dark some times was for the greater good, in the end the work is not done yet, and I think that \"Endgame\" well be the perfect ending for the \"Infinity Saga\".",
        "That's all I can say. This movie could have gone so incredibly wrong with all it's potential to fulfill, but it goes so incredibly right. The shifts in tonal voice and feel, the balance between the superheroes and their abilities, the choreography of the fight scenes, the smooth dialogues, the humor, the emotions - it could not have been done better. I'm baffled by how they were able to pull this off. The only thing that could have lifted the experience for me was if Ebony Maw (black order) was voiced by Bill Nighy - but that's just sugar coating the cherry on top.",
        "This is not your normal Marvel movie and for good reason. My one criticism is that they spent a large portion of the film developing Thanos' character, but the Avengers (and others) seemed to not change, develope, or learn in any significant way from beginning to end. Other than that small issue, it's a well written story and finally a superhero movie that makes me want to see the next one.",
        "Epic just amazing cast and well build up script. A mixture of emotion and action...",
        "Excellent result bonding all these heroes and this history line of the last 10 years.!",
        "Not often I leave a cinema almost stunned, but this was one. The film sucked you in and wrenched you, and was then not afraid to give you a kicking too. Well written, with time taken to develop new characters, this has merged the MCU together and I can't wait for the climax. In the meantime, go and see this film!",
        "Phenomenal movie, each frame is full of entertainment, its a must go!",
        "Visually spectacular, wittingly funny & absolutely chair glueing from start to finish, as a family of 4 we all thoroughly enjoyed this, can't wait for part 2!!!!",
        "I am flabbergasted by all the incredibly negative reviews of this movie. Is it the best movie ever made? Of course not. Is it, as some puerile reviewers imply, the worst movie ever made? Nope, it ain't that either. Somewhere in the depths of reviewer land there exists a rating that is much more reasonable, say an 8 or so. So that's the rating I'll give it. I enjoyed this movie. It kept me entertained, and, excuse me, but that's all most movies should aspire to.",
        "Awesome movie with awesome lineup of superheroes, can't wait to see where Marvel go with it next",
        "I didn't like this one that even though i'm a fan of the avenger movies.",
        "What were you expecting? A long review? Just watch it already if you've seen at least 6 MCU movies.",
        "After 10-years of story building and character development, this is what we get; a montage of most (if not all) of our favorite characters that needed no story build up to understand where they were taking us in the overall story. The only character needing any maintanence during the movie was Thanos himself and that's because the movie was about him. His arc was the final piece to the 10-year old puzzle and it fit perfectly. Action, comedy, thriller, suspense, with a hint of horror, heartbreak, and romance, this movie was everything I've been waiting for and I'm excited to finish the story next summer.",
        "Biggest Wednesday in asia, not disappointed for wait long times ago.",
        "It is great. Thanos is great. But ironman may be too powerful.",
        "The best Series avengers all of time, i'm very enjoyed at i wacht it.",
        "When I watch this movie I've got the same feeling when I saw Thunder Cats the Movie ... that moment when you saw all your heroes in one movie ...\n\nThis movie is perfect in everything, story, characters, VFX, SFX, Music and everything else",
        "Just awesome seeing 10 years of universe build into one single movie, what a great time to be alive.",
        "I loved this movie.\n\nIt was funny, intense and packed with action.\n\nThe end is different and courageous.\n\nThis will be the first movie which I will see 2 times in cinema!",
        "Well as per the my point of view this is the one of the magnificent, humdinger film and production. I am more interested to know what will happen next in second part.",
        "Juat all round great film I also like the guardians and thor combination and the guardians plus iron man, spiderman and Dr strange. Also thanks in this movie is amazing I feel like you come to like him just a bit and obviously. \"Mr stark I don't feel so good\" great piece of acting by Tom Holland",
        "Teenagers will enjoy this film. Decision-making of characters makes no sence at all. There is nothing in this film except special effects, bad jokes and bought reviews.",
        "This movie is like heaven to superhero fans...... Thats it",
        "It was worth the 10 years I've invested watching all the movies. Can't wait for the sequel.",
        "Finally a marvel superhero movie you cant fully foresee whats gonna happen. Perfectly combined major characters. The movie portraits internal struggle for Thanos more than just a pure supervillan. I personally cannot wait to see infinity war 2. And DC will have a hard time catching up for sure .",
        "Liked the content. The graphics are really very good.",
        "I love this movie, even though I know the endings are always leading to peace, love, and heroism, I can't help but side with the villain in this movie. I do believe his theory is correct. This world is overpopulated and needs a way over due cleansing. Team Thanos!!!!",
        "Excellent movie from start to finish, marvels most bigger masterpiece",
        "In the past, I've enjoyed marvel movies, but I've never been a huge diehard fan. I've gotten use to the formula and I went into this movie expecting more of the same. But I'm happy to say that wasn't what I got. Avengers Infinity War has to be one of the most intense, epic movies I've ever seen. With breathtaking visuals, awesome fight scenes, funny one liners, and possibly one of the best villains of all time, Avengers infinity war launches the series in a new, much darker direction than I ever saw coming. You will not be dissapointed.",
        "I have never felt this way after watching a movie before. I'm at a loss for words and can only describe how I feel like I've lost a part of me but I'm not quite sure what it is. By the end of the movie, I didn't even want to talk about it. It just managed to hit me so hard that I'm still in shock. The Russo brothers were able to captivate the audience from the second it started. The balance between all the characters and their chemistry left me in total awe.",
        "I think the heading says it all. Honestly though, one of the best movies made.",
        "The movie was great no doubt but the only shocking thing was most of the avengers did meet each other.The first 20 minutes of the movie was actually kinda boring but still good movie",
        "When I came into this movie I was expecting another marvel movie but I walked out thinking it was great. It is amazing how all of these characters can be in one movie and it not be a catastrophic fail. A 10/10 in my books",
        "If you're a fan of the marvel universe, this is for you. Have fun.",
        "I couldn't appreciate this movie as much as a Marvel fan would because I'm not familiar with many of the Marvel superheroes. That said, I still don't understand why this movie is getting such high IMDb ratings. I'll take an X-Men movie over an Avengers flick every time.",
        "It's getting old. And there is too much reliance on different matchups of Marvel celebrities (the movie frames these moments in a way, with a pause, for the \"ahhh\" factor - \"wow we got a cameo from so and so! And he's fighting along so so and so!\" Thanos character development was pretty good though. Marvel needs to stop relying on its fame and past success by taking easy formulas with no unexpected twists, and simply sugar coating it by putting their now famous characters together.",
        "Try to remember is a superhero movie not a comedy. The body is interesting and everything is trying to make u understand the meaning and the sense of the facts",
        "The dream movie for all Marvel fans. Lots of action, emotions and jokes. Although nkot great. And it does not surpassed Winter Soldier (my favorite MCU movie). Too much changing of scenes that might confuse anyone who haven't watch ALL MCU films.\n\nI'm hype of the continuation of infinity War.",
        "You know it when the lights dimmed The struggle happens it all felt alive and you just can't focus on anything else",
        "This movie went above and beyond all of my hopes and dreams for the MCU. Everything you'd want in a Marvel superhero film and then some. The humour was perfectly timed and placed and the writing and pace of the movie was phenomenal.",
        "Best Movie Of Marvel Cinematic Universe In Ten Years, Actually The Combination And The Mixed Experience Of Past 10 Years Makes This Movie, Everything Is Best, Action, Plot Story And The Most Suspensive Ending.\n\nWatch It And Experience A New Beginning Of Marvel, Hope It Will Be A Box Office Bomb And Come To Second Rank In Overall Worldwide Boxoffice.",
        "I went to the movies with expectations of being a little confused since I haven't seen a lot of the Marvel movies that came out in the last decade that passed. But still, this movie was able to give the perfect amount of background story to make it a compelling movie and then some. I cannot believe how good this movie is. I won't spoil it for you but the last 10 minutes of this movie are amongst the best I have ever seen of any movie. I also noticed he use of foreshadowing for the final scene with expanded my fing mind ever more. The action sequences are incredible and the whole cast did an amazing job, not only with the great comedy the writers blended into the story, but also the heartbreaking and very mysterious sequences of this movie. With all that being said there were some moments in this movie I found to be a little dull (such as the piece of trash that decides to be selfish). I cannot recommend this movie enough though, even for people who aren't particularly fans of superhero movies.",
        "I think this movie is one of the best of MCU in many words is AMAZING, I really love it and if you love Marvel characters you will cry a lot",
        "Anyone who loves super hero's will love this film. It has everything in and keeps you guessing. No matter who your favourite character is they play a vital part in this film. A lot of funny little one liners scattered around aswell. I can safely say this is the best avengers film and quite possibly the best marvel film so far.",
        "This probably one of the best Marvel movie of all times. Thanos was Amazing Villian. That Movie is Epic, phenomenal, Non Stop Action scene, Darkest scene and shocking twist scenes and ending was very nice.",
        "This is very good movie, everyone can enjoy this film a marvel fan or a superhero fan or anormal personwho likes to watch movies. Very reommended",
        "For years, people have demanded a superhero flick where the good guys don't always get there way, something that goes against the norm. And this did, it really did. This is amazing in almost every single way, I didn't like how they kept switching from groups to groups because personally I was just becoming immersed and boom, it changes to another group. This film is everything I expected it to be if not more. The trailers made me feel underwhelmed, esp when we got our first proper look at the CGI Thanos, that's going to be used in this fil. Speaking of Thanos, he may be the best villan that the MCU has to offer for very good reason, he's not just your typical, oh I want to rule the world, he actually believes what he's doing is right and goes incredibly far to prove it. I highly recommend this film for anyone, try to watch the other MCU movies and go in spoiler free, for this film to be truly impacting. 9.8/10, would watch again :)",
        "This movie was extremely incredible and outstanding all around!!!! The Russo brothers did a beautiful job shooting this film!",
        "The epic movie we have been waiting for.Stay till the end",
        "I left the theatre stressed out and sad, but it was awesome. My only complaint is that the CGI was pretty bad at times, especially the green screen.",
        "Now based on the title card. I'm not saying this is the best movie I've ever seen nor am I saying that this is my favorite movie. However, from beginning to end I was hooked and impressively entertained with all of the scenes in this movie. Avengers: Infinity War will have you laughing, crying, and filled with rage. Combining all of these elements into a very emotional film. All of the payment from the last 10 years of Marvel movies is definitely worth it in this movie. The performances are great, each character serves a purpose to the story, and it probably has some of the funniest lines out of any Marvel movie apart from Thor: Ragnarok. The plot doesn't have a lot of depth and seems very simple. But if you've seen all the previous movies leading up to this one you won't even care. Please do not watch this movie if you are being introduced for the first time to the MCU. You will be confused and not care about the characters. Go watch all the MCU movies before seeing this one. This movie was one heck of an experience and I know I will be seeing plenty more of it in the future! WAKANDA FOREVER!!!",
        "To me it is the best movie I have seen till now. It has emotion, jokes, seriousness, everything in it. Infinity War portrayals Thanos very well. He seems almost human. So it is a amazing movie, a must see",
        "This movie is really good not better then the winter soldier or black panther and not the best marvel movie..but it does have the best marvel villain to date and a really good story. But I think it should've been longer, because it did feel like a two parter. But go watch it it's worth the money. My favorite quote \" perfectly balanced as all things should be\".",
        "This is a surprisingly bold and unexpected movie disguised as a summer blockbuster. Excellent choices by Marvel. Just know that you really must see all, or at least most, of the previous Marvel movies to get the full impact of this.",
        "I watched it twice then i realize, why i cant make a review for the movie that you consider it the best of all time 10/10 .",
        "This movie is so great and exciting from the very beginning to the end U will not even get bored for one second",
        "Epic af, one of the best movies I've seen in a while.",
        "Its everything you but its more than that can eyes can see absorb !!!!!!",
        "Its everything you want but its more than you thinks meets the eye",
        "Great blockbuster movie, one of the most entertaining cinema experiences of my life. Not sure if it's the finest marvel film but it's certainly the grandest. Excellent performances from the whole cast as well!",
        "I was really impressed with how they were able to pull off such a massive undertaking",
        "Infinity War is a great superhero movie with a good mixture of action, drama, and comedy. Marvel has outdone themselves with an epic movie ten years in the making.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War surely challenges to be one of the greatest movies of all time. The Russo brothers brilliantly bring together our favourite and most familiar characters from the MCU, from the Avengers, to the Guardians. It starts to tie together all previous Marvel films in a way that exceeded all expectations. With throwbacks and references to the early films (characters unseen since Captain America: The First Avenger) and to the most recent, the film is a roller-coaster of heartbreak, humour, and loyalties. Tremendous praise to the Russo brothers, once again, for culminating so many story lines, so many characters, and so many emotions into one superb film that leaves you on the edge of your seat with your heart racing. Brilliant.",
        "This mashup of almost the entire MCU was a brilliant way to end part 3.",
        "You can't fault this film at all 10 out of 10 really does make up for ultron non stop action from beginning till end. There isn't many films where you get a great ending but this is by far one of the best it keeps you really eager for part 2 I wish I could spill out everything but I hate spoilers so go and watch and enjoy",
        "Absolutely amazing. From start to finish action packed, never a dull moment, truly amazing achievement from everyone who worked on this.",
        "One of the best Marvel (Avenger) movies ever... The graphics, acting, visuals, story line and overall action was mesmerizing! Would I recommend this movie to anyone of course without a doubt! I really enjoyed seeing all the superhero's together especially The Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther, and Doctor Strange! I would go and see this movie multiple times if I could and probably I will again!",
        "I didn't see ALL that coming! It's a AMAZING movie. Not like all the superhero movies before, this one is spectacular. I think they should have considered to tilte this movie \"Thanos: Infinity War.\" However, if they really did that, less audience would come see this move as most people come in the name of \"Avengers\"",
        "One of the best, if not, the best MCU film to date. I wanted to see as much of thanos as possible and get to know this character more and they delivered 10 times over. The visuals and conceptual art in this film is utterly incredible. Weta of course.\n\nThis film nailed everything I wanted in this first instalment.",
        "So this is what the whole previous 18 MCU movies were working towards? WORTH IT. This movie was dark, funny, and just pure awesome. The opening scene will put a chill down your spine, and it's only when this scene is over do you truely understand what your watching. It has a great mix of humour to make this movie not too dark, but a perfect amount which DC may be lacking. And once the movie is over, you will walk out of the cinema wondering \"what did I just watch...\" this is truly is a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come, nothing can top this.",
        "What a surprise! Good intro, ending is so also good! The Part 2 is go to be better!!!",
        "Some of the films that lead up to this have been a bit so so. As mentioned before, if you have seen everything prior to this then you will have a good time. Obviously all interlinked and great fight scenes and actually has a plot with some explainers in there. Had high hopes and low expectations but very surprised and delighted. It was like watching a comic book story which is ultimately what we wanted.",
        "Emotions run high throughout. Marvel has made it possible for me to feel sympathy for Thanos during this film, however it has been made clear the importance of every actor, but in my personal opinion how important Spider-Man (Tom Holland) whose acting was beyond phenomenal, I was almost brought to tears because of the superb quality of acting that he (Tom) provided. Overall this movie ends on a note of pure anticipation for next year! If you can't handle anticipation well, I recommend viewing this movie later. Although in my opinion it was well worth the wait.",
        "Epic. Emotional. Two and half hours of total excitement and when credits hit the screen, I was there hoping that second part of the movie were about to start. So sad I have to wait one more year for that. It was very dark with more of a serious tone. Darker than Winter Soldier which I love. The villain is finally here. The villain par excellence, Josh Brolin portrays the best villain in the MCU. In the beginning I hated Thanos. By the end of the movie I even felt sorry for him for a few seconds. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. For the most part, Infinity War does justice to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. And there are a few standouts amongst all heroes. RDJ and Cumberbatch most of all.\n\nThe film ends even more bravely than it began. Final minutes were a stroke of bold narrative and so audacious. For a superheroes movie, 10/10.",
        "I cannot contain my excitement! This film is the very best the MCU has to offer. It gives you a lot of thrills and shocks from the get go. All the cast members were incredible especially Brolin himself. His take on the mad titan is so daunting yet so relatable. (Not the best father figure) but you can see the time and effort which has gone into the character. Also he is an absolute beast!!! (Like Barney the dinosaur on roids) the storyline is captivating and for such a massive ensemble of all star actors, the film delivers and keeps the viewer interested and does not feel to overpowering and overcrowded at any time. The cast work so well together from the very serious scenes to the comedic timing of other scenes. a blend of drama and action really set the tone on why MCU is destroying DC films at the moment. Great watch 10/10",
        "I don't know how a superhero sci-fi action film can be any more entertaining than this. It was such a well-paced, well-scripted film which was filled to the brim with excitement and had just a dash of humor. The story never once seemed too big for the directors to convey or the characters to portray considering the end of the universe was at stake. Credit the Russo brothers for their vision and the cast for an incredible delivery. Marvel set the bar so extremely high here that its hard to expect anything more than disappointment when Part 2 rolls out in 2019. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully I'm wrong. Because I sure can't wait to conclude this epic tale of triumph and destruction come next year. Once again Marvel, your hold on the cinematic universe has just become stronger than Thanos's grip inside the Infinity Gauntlet.",
        "Avengers Infinity War is a good movie that continues to make the same plot mistakes and the same abuse of comedy. For a story arc as important as Thanos's, this joke takes away seriousness and in no time you connect with that threat. The action scenes are very good and the CGI excellent although it also has moments in which it is very bad ... if you do not see Bruce Banner inside the Hulk Buster so that they realize. An entertaining movie but full of empty plot and I'm telling you that NO, it's not the best superhero movie in history as they do not try to sell it, it's not even the best Marvel movie to date, that's what Iron Man is for 1, Captain America Winter Soldier and the first of Avengers that are still better, much less is on par with the great movie of Nolan The Dark Knight as they try to make us believe too, that is still the best superhero movie ever created. My rating is a 6.5 out of 10.",
        "Like most people I went in expecting it to be good, and serviceably handle the number of characters that had to be balanced. I didn't expect it to do I in such a consummate, thrilling, emotional, funny and powerful way. There have been high water marks in different ways before in the MCU - Thor Ragnarok (comedy), Civil War (ensemble), Guardians 1 (left field-ness), but this raises the bar in every way.",
        "A masterpiece that fills you with all possible emotions. ONCE YOU WATCH IT YOU WANNA WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.",
        "These superhero movies keep getting worse and worse.",
        "Loved it. What makes this film is the combination of so many characters that we know but they don't know each other. It was awesome to see these people meet for the first time and see how they reacted to each other.\n\nIt's witty and does well to give each character decent screen time. Thank you Marvel",
        "As a long time marvel fan this did not disappoint. Sometimes if was like wait what cause so much going on and still unsure as to where one of the stones came from but I blame the shit Thor movies for that. Awesome see - need to go again!",
        "Waited 10 years for this masterpiece and I've to say it was worth waiting. Infinity War is the best MCU movie ever. Loved each and every second of it. The ending is gonna leave you in shock. It is gonna be remembered for ages. I have never written any review before but I couldn't stop myself from sharing my thoughts about the movie. A must watch for everyone. Thank you Russo Brothers for making such a spectacular movie. Can't wait for the sequel.",
        "Just see it, go now! One star reviews for this Film are completely ridiculous! This is the culmination of 10 years of Marvel films, everything's gradually been building towards the Infinity stones story line. Don't watch only this film and then complain there is no plot! The best parts of the film are the character interactions, it's genuinely hilarious, although overall the film is pretty dark in tone. It's no real spoiler to say that major characters do die. The standouts for me were Thor and the Guardians, so much great banter. The same can be said for Stark, Strange and Spider-Man. Most characters get enough screen time and the action is relentless, jumping from one action set piece (or World) to another without feeling too much. You will experience just about every emotion watching this film. The scenes in Wakanda was also a stand out, especially the battle! Make no mistake though, this is definitely part one of a two part film. It's going to be a very long year to find out how this story ends in Avengers 4.",
        "The title says it all\n\nGreat action Funny as HELL Great villain A great ending",
        "Im truly sad for ending.... But the whole movie is just awesome... Acting, directing , writing, everything is almost perfect. i have to say that marvel doing great job, great plan for these 10 years. Everything connects to previous movies. Directors made it best as possible",
        "Best best best movie eveeeeeer , I can seen this movie millions of times and never get bored",
        "Impossible to describe. The hype, emotions and own theories were just wrong. Dont let anyone spoil it for you. It's worth it. Do not miss a single second.",
        "It's hard to say whether this movie would appeal to viewers not already immersed in the MCU Infinity Stones story arc but from my perspective as a die hard Marvel fan, this film is absolutely excellent. There's a lot of plot strands happening at once but the makers have done a great job of keeping it rattling along, coherent and above all exciting. Can't wait for 'Avengers 4'!",
        "Hello there , after seeing Avengers Infinity War this morning I felt I had to share a fraction of my enthusiasm for this movie. It's a rare thing indeed that a movie lives up to its hype , how often have you went to the cinema only to discover that the best parts are all in the trailer ? Well, fear not , because this is the best Marvel movie so far. The first 5 minutes are awesome and hooks you straight away but hang on because this is truly a roller coaster ride that just speeds up from this point. Whilst some people might worry that at 2 hours 20 , this may be a bum-numbing experience , but rest assured , this movie flies over all too fast and leaves you wanting more . One major advantage this super hero film has over the rest is the main villain, Thanos. This is the first time I can actually remember a murderous tyrant having a rational reason for destroying half a galaxy and Josh Brolin's performance is nothing short of incredible. Seriously , go see this movie NOW before someone reveals the many great scenes or plot twists - YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED !!!!!.",
        "Expect the first part of 2. Sadly, my biggest issue is the suspension of disbelief over the nanotech.",
        "Watched it, and now i cant stop thinking/ talking about it. a really must see",
        "Best Marvel movie ever made this movie is nuts the story telling and action sequences are smooth and epic truly an epic collision with thanos all characters are great in this movie everyone did so good loved it",
        "As a big Marvel fan, this satisfied everything I could ever want out of an action movie. Josh Brolin did an incredible job playing Thanos and he became my favorite Marvel villain. I loved that we got to see all of the characters come together to fight Thanos in Marvels most epic battle yet. The jokes are funny, the actions sequences are intense and the characters all have their moments where they shine. The ending will leave you wanting more and very impatient to get it. Not only is it Marvel's best, but probably one of the best movies I've ever seen period.",
        "One of the best things i've ever watched, action scenes were top notch, script was funny, thanos was voiced absolutely excellently one of my favourite films ever",
        "Innovative movie. I have waited and theorized for years. The movie was awesome.",
        "The movie starts with a really extraordinary beginning. Then it gets weirder and gets fast and you get really exhausted to keep track of everything that is going on.\n\nThe ending was predictable and heartbreaking but then again, you know that it all will be good in the end at avengers 4",
        "Es de lo mejor de lo mejor . La mejor pel\u00edcula hasta el momento",
        "Watched it for the 2nd time today. Great to see all our favorite characters in one movie. Exciting, heartbreaking and awe- inspiring.",
        "Action-packed, great story, wonderful visual, and else",
        "Considering it's a superheroes movie, it stands as one of the best.",
        "Though all marvel films up to this point have been entertaining crowd pleasers this one took lots of risks and had many permanent consequences. Something that I personally have been wanting from these marvel movies for a long time. Though it is far from perfect, it's flaws can easily be over looked.",
        "It was a hell of a ride with this movie! So much emotion, so much joy, so much energy, so much empathy, so much fun, so much tears! And again so much fun! Characters were so real presented, and so relatable. I felt like I was part of them, they were honest, determinated and every scene was intense. Whole movie was understandable, while it presented every point of view of the characters. They were so relatable. I enjoyed every second of the movie! I couldn't believe that beginning would be so intense. Not to mention the end of the movie, which was just perfect...despite river of tears....I think this movie is a MASTERPIECE! The characters were so good presented. So as the villain. Just wow, as Loki. Understandable and amazing! Brolin was amazing and makes the villain shine! All I can say is, MARVEL is killing it! It was amazing and I am proud to be marvels fan! I am till the end of the line with them!!!",
        "After watching twice on the movie theater, I'm obsessed! This is movie is incredibly beautiful/chaotic/funny It shows basically the reality that we're already living..... great expectations for the next",
        "This movie was a rollar coaster from start to finish. It was like the movie was split into three sections, each section like each team. So it was like you were going from one location to another and back again. The story was well written though the giant cliffhanger at the end was upsetting. Very much unlike marvel. Josh Brolin, Zoe Saldana, and Chris Hemsworth stole the show in my opinion. The chemistry between Thanos and Gamora was really good. RDJ was as always great and a lot of emotion all round the movie.",
        "I am writing this review during the credits of my screening. My mind just got blasted into peices. Jesus Christ. Loved it but my god",
        "Best marvel movie Perfect story Awesome graphical Good music",
        "One of the best you'll see this year. Amazing movie.",
        "This movie is one of the best I have seen in a while. The chemistry between characters is amazing (best was Doctor Strange and Ironman) and the action was incredible. Thanos is not like other Marvel villains he thinks he is saving the world and he cares. The cameos were spot on and didn't feel awkward about them and the story itself was phenomenal. The ending was probably the best and worst part of the movie and once it ends you won't be able to stop thinking about it. The one problem with this is that it will not be a good movie if you haven't seen the other big MCU movie. 11/10",
        "This is the most important movie in world it is incredible and amazing movie",
        "This movie is absolutly amazing. The history proves that once you try to make more than few heroes an more than one storyline, the movie become mess. But brothers russo created an amazing movie with deep, emotional story that the last 10 has led to, with over 30 characters they created a stable running plot that does not stop for a secound. Thanos is one of cinema best bad guys ever with a real agenda and complex conflicts that make it very complicated to not agree and the deep of the character made Thanos-the villain to movie main character and he is the one who gives the tune for the movie. Visually, the movie is avsoulotly georges. The visual effects and characters customs look just real and i have no complain for it I have no bad word to say about the movie so go and see it.",
        "Infinity war was all the hype and then some. Must see if you're a comic book fan and mcu fan.",
        "It is the best MCU movie in my opinion, it is refreshing, emotional and has a really great villain. It is a wonderful experience",
        "Specially, I'm a big fan of Marvel. This time they rock it again with \"Avengers: Infinity War\". All the spectaculars action scenes and emotions will gives you goosebumps. I never seen this kind of Action Villain in any movies yet. THANOS like a Anti-Villain, He done fabulous job with his perfections. Much awaited for Avengers 4.",
        "I am not a fan of marvel but, they should make \"THANOS STORY\" I am damn sure that will be 10/10 hit.",
        "The movie was two hours and 30 minutes and the entire movie was exciting and full of action!",
        "Wonderful movie, and that's before they really go for it!",
        "The hype is real. The fight scene is this movie is epic!!!",
        "Personally I thought it was excellent. I wasn't expecting Oscar performances or deep plot just an enjoyable action film showing just how tough Thanos really is and this doesn't disappoint. There was alot of story to cover even in over 2.5 hours of film but thought it was done very well. Can't wait for next film.",
        "I feel very exited to watch this movie,they can give me a good mood,that's enough!bless the world!",
        "Best movie of 2018. Best superhero movie to date. It will make you cheer, laugh, and cry. It will make you beg for more. It would be hard to get every superhero involved, but they found a way. This is one you simply can't miss.",
        "You clearly don't understand that the only good movie DC ever released, was wonderwoman. And i'll give it to you, but marvel breaks the ice here. 18 movies now, and all were better than your hugely dissapointing justice league. I dont care whos more original, but this movie is the breaker. And for those 80 year old grandma's who went to see this with their kid... just stop",
        "I Think best movie in the 2018.Robert Downey Jr best actor on the Movie world..",
        "You have to give Marvel studios some credit. They have the job of making it the most hyped/ best marvel movie ever. The CGI was ok it wasn't the best, but there was so much pressure on Marvel. This movie was great, sad, but great. The story was well thought up and resembled the comics a ton. The character combinations went very well telling us they are in the same universe which makes the future way more exciting. Making the best movies puts a huge reliability on Marvel, every year people are excited for a new movie and they usual don't disappoint. Watch this movie you won't regret it.",
        "I was really exited for this movie and after watch I am just amazed the charcters are amazing josh brolin as thanos is incredible and the action is so good a must watch film",
        "Don't ask anyone about the movie before you see it!",
        "A nice movie to watch. Probably the best marvels movie yet.",
        "In this film, Thanos was the most fascinating and also the most complex personality of the story.",
        "Impressed how marvel cinematic universe is rising and converging at one point. Cant wait for the next part.",
        "Avengers infinity war was one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had In a marvel movie the movie succeeds on entertainment value alone and the ending had me frozen in my seat. Unfortunately it's suffers from some poor character development except for with thanos who shines through as one of my favourite marvel villains. All the set pieces are memorable and more than up to standard as expected and we do get a lot of plot which is good because the lead up meant a lot needed to happen and it definitely delivered. Another great aspect was the sense of desperation that was a strong theme throughout the movie and it held a constant sense of tension during the whole runtime and did not hold back in what it did to some characters",
        "Never Expected this type of Endings in MCU movies.. Long live Thanos :D",
        "This is awesome move. I liked it so much. I saw it in hindi 3d version. 3d quality is so good and its story just awesome. This move has really good visual effects.",
        "So dissapointed, a movie that take too long doesnt bring any brilliant job,with the same absurd and cringe comedy comes again with a cliffhanger not likeable.",
        "Frack me! Another spellbinding Avengers film. I am left stunned, exhausted, and aching for the next chapter in this story. How the hell am I going to go to sleep?!? What magic that storytellers could have me so emotionally and intellectually invested in fictitious events.",
        "This movie is not only good as a crossover sequel finale comedy drama movie it's also a good standalone movie to",
        "To say this movie was awesome is an understatement. This movie was an emotional roller coaster that I was perfectly fine with dealing with. At this point, I think I've seen this movie about 4 different times. This movie had me dying of laughter one second and then choking on my own tears the next. The action was awesome. The special effects were perfect. The comedy was actually really good. I loved that we got to see more of Peter Parker. Everything really fit like a puzzle.",
        "As someone recently wrote, this movie will really blow your mind.\n\nThis is the movie that ultimately made my dig extremely deep into the Marvel Universe for the first time. My first reaction of it was absolute disappointment followed by extreme cravings on finding out what would happen next. Well, to be honest, I nearly cried in the end of the movie. This made buy more Marvel Comics that I think I first could've even afford. I realized after a short while that this movie, due to my reaction, is the most brilliant I've seen for a long while.",
        "This film was properly one of the best films I have every seen, the story was very intriguing.",
        "Edge in my seat the whole time and very well paced! Beautiful fight scenes and great emotion",
        "Another great Marvel movie that has no dull moments at all. It always has you on the edge of your seat and adds a lot to the MCU. It also leaves you on a major cliffhanger making you want more. Looking even more forward to the next Marvel movies.",
        "This movie was pact with emotional roller coaster, dry humour, visual effects and full of thrill. I wish they had an interaction between Tony and Steve but it's worth waiting for the next one. It was really interesting that they had space for each character and their significance. Their participation was as important as others. As a whole it was really awesome and I'm hyped about the sequel.",
        "Such a great movie! can't wait for the new one to come out this year!!!!!!!!!",
        "Amazing film.. clearly the pinnacle of cinematic excellence portrayed through CGI and acting. LOVED IT.\n\nCant wait for endgame.",
        "Is a very-very good movie! I love it! The End is really sad! / Ez egy nagyon-nagyon j\u00f3 film! Szerettem! A v\u00e9ge nagyon szomor\u00fa!",
        "What freakin movie this is awesome the best movie from the mcu yet",
        "If Peter wouldn't have punched it is a ten star. That's all I gotve say Nebula was doing nothing She should've stopped quill",
        "The film had both amazing acting and an intriguing storyline that keeps you interested from the second it starts till the end. It sets up the final instalment in the avengers universe (endgame) extremely well and each character and plot in the movie is crafted superbly. Definitely recommend watching you won't regret.",
        "The action is like nothing I have ever seen before can't wait fir endgame and whatever it takes",
        "Though this is very much an Avengers movie, it feels like it could easily belomg to Thanos'. I always watched Marvel Movies in the same childlike glee I once had at a younger age, excited for the action and comedy but never really overly afraid or anxious of the outcome. More often than not, super hero movies end the way you expect them to, not much trepidation is required, and with Marvel's formula of mirroring what makes a villain I just couldn't ever feel the edge of my seat. This movie however, blew all that out the water. Not not only did they manage to create a monster I can sympathise with and at times agree with, they conjured up the perfect anti-hero. This is the film where Marvel put on it's big boy pants and, as a self proclaimed DC lover, it beats every super hero movie out there. In one word, shocking. Just...shocking.",
        "Amazing kind of movie with a lot of action. You gonna love if you are a true marvel fan but if you are not believe me You Will Be",
        "This is what a great franchise supposed to be! I was afraid, soon will comes the day, when no one (except me, ofc.) ever again interested to watch any superhero comic adaptation on the big screen.\n\nBut now I can still see a bright future of this genre.\n\nAfter I saw this epic space-symphony finally, I just wanna watch infinity times, again & again. :)\n\nCould tell more but want zero spoiler, let you discover the whole movie for yourself! If you are fan of MARVEL movies, then definitely you will enjoy this real gem.",
        "After watching Endgame yesterday I start appreciating it even more.This movie had everything : incredible twists, character development, thriller action, best acting, no plot armor etc.",
        "Constant excitement, questions and emotions. I left the theatre not knowing how to feel or what will happen next. Already starting the count down for part 2. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.",
        "But couldn't get it to it like I did the other movies.",
        "This movie is just so amazing! Even though it has so many characters it never feels like one character is more on screen than the others (except for Thanos of course!).",
        "I was sure with having so many characters, stories would be lost. I was way wrong. This movie kept you wanting more from the start. Can't wait for the next one!!",
        "I did not go into this movie with very high expectations, it looked to me that it would be a mess with all the main characters. I am very happy to say that I am wrong. The way that this film handles all the main characters is great and and did not expect it to be this way. I honestly can't say this is a film, this is more like a three hours of straight climax which is actually done really well. Another thing that this movie does well are the characters themselves. While some characters get more attention then other (for example War Machine gets a lot less screen time than Iron Man), most of the characters are given adequate screen time. One more note about the characters is that Thanos is genuinely the best character in this movie. He gets the most character development of any Marvel villain and any character in this movie. Most of his development in the film is spoilers and I don;t want to deprive anyone of this amazing experience. For those reading this don't spoil the movie for anyone, don't kill the moment some have been waiting ten years for.",
        "This movie is the most interesting one I've ever seen.",
        "Ignore the people giving this low scores, this is an amazing movie and clearly they are bitter and trying to bring down the ratings or something. The way they bring together so many characters in one movie is amazingly well done & it works. There are almost no boring parts in the movie. What surprised me most is that although I hated things Thanos did he's not simply pure evil, he's doing it out of a sense of achieving a greater good. His regret during certain actions makes me feel differently about him then other typical bad guys. I've seen it 4 times and it's enjoyable each time, I definitely look forward to owning it! Now one of my all time favourite movies. I typically don't believe in a perfect movie but this one comes as close as I've ever seen.",
        "Great movie! I enjoy every second of this movie. Great directors and great writer.",
        "One of the best around! One of the best around! One of the best around! One of the best around! One of the best around! One of the best around! One of the best around! One of the best around!",
        "The movie, Avengers: Infinity War, is one of the greatest Marvel movies ever made. The movie consisted of tons of action, perspective changes and plot twists. The movie also had a lot of Marvel superheroes. Secondly, there was 10 years and 18 movies building up to this movie. Lastly, Infinity Wars made a grand total of 2.048 billion dollars. I think we can all agree that a movie with plot twists and a lot of action can be extremely good. These additions can not only make the movie more enjoyable, but they also help contribute to the amount of movie it makes. Let's look at the 2.048 billion dollars Infinity Wars made.Movies are filled with different elements. Plot twists, perspective changes, action, they all contribute to making the movie a great film.Infinity Wars consists of all these attributes, and more. Also, a movie that has had 18 other Marvel movies building up to it, it's bound to be good. Lastly, a movie that has made over 2 BILLION dollars is undeniably worth watching.",
        "Best SuperHero movie so far. MCU, you're the BEST. Can't wait for part II.",
        "Although there are a lot of heroes but the story is not messy. Thanos is so human and Iron man is great as usual. Thor also evolves so much...",
        "Really bad but I wouldn't say the worst Avengers movie that title is for endgame, but this one is really bad itself. Disney does one thing really well ruined franchise",
        "From the stylish cinematography to the stunning visual effects this movie has it all. Once again Robert Downey JR gives a confident performance as he leads the avengers into a breathtaking battle. The ensemble cast has the performance of there life time as the likes of Tom Holland and Benedict Cumberbatch amaze the audience. The avengers has officially revolutionised modern cinema as we know it.",
        "A little bit different with trailers. All characters performed well",
        "This brought so many things to fruition. AMAZING point blank, period.",
        "Action from start to finish, with characters killed off left, right and centre. The finale leaves me wanting more, along with notable admissions and teasers leaving me wanting to see the up and coming Marvel releases even more than I did as well!",
        "Watching this movie was making me ask why there are so many unemployed actors in L. A., and the well-paid spend their time \"acting\" in the likes of this one. I guess the kids need time off from their smartphones.",
        "Best Marvel ever! Fun and fun-tastic! Unexpected and makes curious what's going to happen next. Don't miss to watch the end credit scenes.",
        "Mind blown!! Bring on the next one!! Lived up to every expectation - the cinema in stunned silence - the visuals and story line surpassing all before. Thank you too all the great creative minds in the world.",
        "A lot of jokes didnt land as expected and too much drag on the storyline with all heroes trying to earn their place in the movie",
        "Firstly, I really appreciate the effort put into the film. They did a great job in bringing the infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Every superhero got their fair share of screen time. They increased the stakes by killing a number of key characters at the end! But I will say the movie was more about the villain Thanos than the heroes.. so it was missing that typical Marvel touch. All in all, I liked the movie. But I enjoyed some of the previous Marvel movies more.",
        "Thoroughly enjoyed the film, lots of content but all fell into place",
        "This movie will blow your mind, especially if you have seen the others and you know the back stories. The action from the very first second and throughout the entire movie does not let you get bored or take a break. You simply can not stop watching it. I personally want more. Can\"t wait to see what will happen next",
        "The Russos have in one foul swoop forgotten what a comic book movie is meant to be about. Instead they've attempted to make a dramatic oscar winner but in essence screwed up 10 years hard work by hundreds of actors and filmmakers. The first movie the the entire MCU that i want a refund for seeing at the theater and will never watch again.",
        "This truly Blew me away, I honestly expected to be disappointed but... that couldn't be further from the truth. The direction that they took was so well executed. I will need to see it again and again. I truly love this movie!",
        "If you're a fan of the previous movies, this film will definitely make you laugh one moment and cry the next. The movie starts an incredibly fast past, largely because the tension has already been built up in the after credits of the previous films (Thano's 2-3 cameos). The star of this film is definitely Josh Brolin, as he displays unique emotional depth as the nihilistic villian Thanos. I don't think I've seen another movie that packs quite so much into the time frame given I wouldn't have cut or added anything. After the film was over, everyone in the theater said something similar to \"I need to go sit down and think about what just happened.\" This is likely due to the emotional shifts, the constant struggle of the characters, and the sense of unending dread the movie makes you feel. I gave this movie 10 stars, because there really isn't any valid criticism to give. This was an incredibly hard movie to pull off and my hat goes off to the guys at Marvel and the directors for being able to do so. I'm excited for Part 2 and the next Phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",
        "MCU has been out for about 10 years and the fact that Avengers Infinity War consolidates all those years is just absolutely insane! This movie is one of the most amazing movies in the MCU and we are able to see all this mixture of characters that connect each other and brings back all those past memories ever since the release of Iron Man.",
        "Everyone needs to see this movie. Disney and Marvel once again, deliver a mind blowing movie experience. From start to finish, my jaw was on the floor! Best movie ever",
        "It's funny how I thought it was a disgrace of a film when my friend took me to the theatre to see it, but after a few years it still sticks because of how Thanos is projected as villain and slowly I'm starting to wonder if he is. I wonder if - would this story be told again in a few decades - he would be a hero for taking on such a task.",
        "A decade worth of waiting has never felt soo good, nonstop action from the moment the movie begins, it redeemed marvels last cliffhanger with some amazing action from the start",
        "Must have paid so many people to write good reviews on this one. Pure and utter garbage!!!!",
        "Averagers infinity war it's darl movie and a funny",
        "Wow,just wow.\n\nI was so thrilled going into the cinema, expecting great action, amazing visuals, funny jokes, and it delivered. This has to be the best marvel movie i have watched so far! IM STILL PUMPED I CANT SLEEP!",
        "The movie was fantastic, within the first 5 minutes the audience knew they were in for the long haul, it was spectacular. Usually, we expect credits that are comical but this one we just get a black screen with white credits. It was simply amazing from the fight scenes which were pretty much the whole time, but it also showed the dynamic ranges of the characters.",
        "Just amazing, brilliant story line and great intertwining of all characters",
        "This movie was really a good one. It had almost everything emotion, fun and some or I will say many unexpected things related to the death of superhero's or stones location. This movie deserves 9/10 and it is a movie which you will feel to watch 2-3 more times.",
        "Maybe my review is really different from another perception. I always watch that Marvel movies (under Walt Disney Company) is similar with DC Movies.. like Avenger Civil War is similar with Batman VS Superman, and now Infinity War, that Thanos search power stone is similar like Steppenwolf search Mother's Box to accumulate his power to become unlimited.. but we should admitted that Marvel is more attractive than DC",
        "...the nagging feeling in the back of your mind that no Marvel hero ever truly, permanently dies will undermine a lot of the emotional poignancy Infinity War tries so hard to convey.",
        "...the nagging certainty in the back of your mind that no Marvel hero will ever truly, permanently die inevitably undermines a lot of the emotional poignancy Infinity War tries so hard to convey.",
        "SO for so many characters to be assembled in a movie, I thought it was well done without feeling too over packed. The plot developed at an appropriate pace and there was still character development. I was a bit dissapointed that The Gaurdians of the Galaxy so readily split apart(it just doesn't go with the family message of their last film). I was extremely dissapointed that Marvel has eliminated Captain America. Never was his super hero name mentioned in the film. No more red, white and blue; he now wears black. No more stars on the chest or shield. He now introduces himself as \"Steve Rogers\". And every reference is to \"Cap\" or \"Captain\" at best. Shame to see the iconic hero being changed for the sake of international ticket sales.",
        "My overall review of Avengers: Infinity War is \"EPIC\" It had the story line that it needed and also multiple aspects within the film from start to finish. It has the must needed action that everyone is desperate to see. And without a doubt you most certainly get that. It has such a drive throughout the film for Thanos to achieve his goal, but the Avenger and GOTG give a good game. It has outclassed the previoud Avengers and gives you that better build up that everyone has longed for! That's having every superhero who's been on the screen put together. To me that film was that good I could never get bored of it and I already want to go and watch it again a thousand times over. The story is that good that you can't help yourself from doing just that. I would advise all to watch this whether you aren't a fan or haven't watch the previous before.",
        "Best avengers movie - slightly edged Ragnarok. The whole movie was action and comedy through amazing display of heroes. Amazing",
        "It was a hell of a ride! No word needed...simply amazing! So good characters development. So many emotions, so much fun, so much energy, so much tears...ending was just like woe, breathless and emotional. So many characters but each one of them was great presented! After 10 years everithing came together, on the other hand fell apart...so much depth in this story! Congrats MARVEL! I am with you till the end of the line!!!!",
        "For me it wasn't worth the wait. Captain America : Civil War had a better story line. Infinity War was not my favorite Avengers movie but at least it was better than Justice League!!!!",
        "A movie that will forever be remembered as the greatest super hero movie yet to be made",
        "I had hope and moderate expectations for this film, Esp after seeing the heart of gold Black Panther film a couple months back and Thor Ragnorak was pretty decent. Both far more original than any avengers film in previous years, Went went my two teen sons to a packed house. The final is a grade F of any cinemascore Loud Boos all around. Horrible Mess is putting nicely. Avengers franchise flicks will not see one more red cent whether it is a movie ticket to a dvd rental. Done Finished finito! Not sure if its the fan boys being paid to write these reviews. Or its a global Russian hacking gig, But in no way could this rubbish heap garner that much praise without the studios lining pockets. But Mark my words once the word gets out and believe ya cant hide it like a tinder match thrown in a dry as bone woods. the fire will catch and grow in a blazing forestfire. And you the movie going public deserve so much more for your hard earned cash. F-",
        "Then go see it again! It goes a o much beyond the hype.",
        "So good I saw it twice.\n\nNo spoilers here, go see this movie.",
        "Thanos was very well played and the movie left me anxious for part 2! I remember seeing it in theaters and everyone gasped at a few moments. It was gripping.",
        "So as i said it's the best that marvel ever had! i have been watching Marvel Since 2012 When Avengers 2012 Released ,",
        "The movie is just brilliant, to me it is the best marvel movie yet. Marvel seem to impress me every time.",
        "The scale of this movie is astonishing. I felt like I was watching 4 different movies and they are connected to each other. Lots of laughs, emotions, excitement, and stories. Have to watch previous 20 Marvel films to fully connected to this movie. Great movie. At last end game.",
        "The thrilling action, the most numerous superheroes in one movie, all whit his previews introductions in other movies. Excellent in all aspects",
        "Best Avengers film yet with the best villain I've ever seen",
        "Simply amazing. Can't wait for the next one. Had me at the edge of my seat.",
        "I left the cinema absolutely astounded at this film. The action is immaculate, and at times, had me fist-pumping the air. There is also a lot of humour, as expected, but make no mistake, this is probably the darkest film in the MCU. Thanos is without doubt the best villain in the series, he was 100% worth the wait. I was particularly impressed with how they fit in every character in the film perfectly, every character interaction was amazing. And the ending left me completely speechless. Just go and watch this film.",
        "Delivers on the hype, wasn't predictable to your usual MCU films with the best MCU Villain to date with a really well written story and up there with the best villains ever and that ending is one of the best endings ever.",
        "Infinity War was AMAZING! An awesome culmination of 10 years and 18 films. I must say that Thanos was pretty badazz. I would venture to say the best villain in the MCU at this point, by leaks and bounds. I ventured as far as checking out some spoilers for the film because I was so snaxious and GLAD to find that almost most of that was false! The actual events in the movie were action-packed from the opening scenes. It was essentially a series of third acts. This movie is filled with surprises and great humor. Thor might be my favorite character after IW and Ragnarok.\n\nNow I can't wait to see it again, and to see the upcoming movies for the MCU. The next few years for Marvel/Avengers will be quite interesting. This just may be my favorite film in the MCU, for now.",
        "Sorry but it really does live up to the hype, we were totally enthralled- had us guessing throughout and on the edge of our seats",
        "I like these movies because they explain the backstory to most of the main characters. This movie did just that and we loved it! Hope you all go see it and love it as much as we did!!",
        "Short review:\n\nHonestly, this movie was spectacular to look at. The visuals were outstanding and from that point of view, it gets a 9/10 (nothing is ever perfect).\n\nBut.. From my own point of view, regarding the movie as a whole, it gets a 6,5/10. Throughout the whole movie, they were just fighting.. And fighting.. And fighting. The story evolved and then they kept on fighting. Some people might like this and get excited by it, but not me. I do recommend watching it if you like superheroes or movies with a lot of special effects, but (a lot of \"buts\") for me it got way too much.",
        "As someone who has followed every Marvel movie leading up to this, I feel that this movie was everything I thought it would be and more. I would watch this movie over and over again. It was an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish and I can't wait until part 2 comes out.",
        "I gotta say this is one of the best super hero movie so far. I watched this movie 6 times in Cinema. And I even bought the Bluray to see it again. All cast did amazing job the writing and direction is super. Cant wait for next title",
        "Personally believe that all bad reviews are from people who were looking for a reason to hate it.. it's awesome and heartbreaking!!",
        "Epic.......... why....? because it is ten years of preparing to this WOW moment every thing was just perfect we laught we cry we enjoy .....",
        "Although I doubt this movie will win any non editing awards it is a genuinely enjoyable movie. A movie not afraid to break off from superhero movie cliches, Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War is a movie that has something for everyone. Anyone who didn't enjoy this movie didn't want to enjoy it. Infinity War is easily the best Marvel movie to date with one of the all time greatest movie villains.",
        "It deserves a 10 my opinion I love this movies thanos best villain",
        "When this movie was announced I was super hyped for it & after seeing it on opening day I will gladly say that this movie did not disappoint in the slightest, not only is this the best MCU movie but it's the best comic book movie period. Also without revealing too much I just wanna say that you should be sure to bring a box of tissues with you when you see it.",
        "Okay people, i usually dont rate or comment on movies but i am going to... The Russo Brothers put together a really great movie, with a heart stopping ending.... Without giving to much away. This movie kept you on the edge of your seat the whole f.....ing movie cause you didnt know who was going to live or die from one minute to the next and there was some heart wretching killings.....But hopefully with that 4million to one odds that Doc saw they can pull it together to kill Thanos in the next one. Stay til the end of credits scene guys cause the beeper calls guess who?",
        "This movie is bad as a alonestanding movie but i think in the series it is ok",
        "The movie blow my mind and it is beyond my expectation. Just go and see it for yourself. It is just that good that it makes me write my first movie review in my entire life.",
        "Marvel style lots of action, lots of booms and bangs and somebody gets new weapons/ability by the end of the movie. The story is a little poor, 2,5h and there are still questions without answers if you did not saw any other Marvel Movies.",
        "Are there plot holes and/or issues with the movie, yes. However, for the amount of characters and things going on in this movie, they did a great job making a coherent good movie. I found myself laughing and having a really good time with this movie and I never got bored. It makes me really excited to see the next avengers movie and where they go from here.",
        "I think this film is brilliantly executed, with many gasp, cheer and laugh moments. How it's truly viewed will be after the next film comes out to see if that ending was worth it.",
        "Lot of people here giving 1 star and complain about \"Bang boom bang and that's it\". For people who don't know about the plot and have no idea about superhero movies... this is not for them. So stop complaining about it like idiots.\n\nFor comic and superhero movie fans... this is the best movie out there. and the best MCU movie so far. Amazing work.",
        "I refuse to write any spoilers so I'll just say this movie does not disappoint for any marvel fan. It a fun movie, you're emotions will be all over the place by the end and you'll be counting down the days for the conclusion.",
        "I won't say anything I know i would be hated just by writing this But as far as i see, its the first time marvel wasted characters, can't create the dark and urgency of how dangerous thanos is, can't be bright enough to be the com action it usually is, and just ... that Wasting some, overuse some... But i do appreciate the cgi and the ensemble of actors and actresses used here",
        "Eventhough they go overboard with the jokes sometimes mostly enjoyable. Many people talks about plot holes and most of them are bullsheet",
        "It was so good that i'm going to watch it again! The Avengers: Infinity War isn't just a gussied-up mediocrity being widely mistaken for a good movie. It's also, at least arguably, a dangerous movie for anyone who cares about the future of American cinema.",
        "This movie has the right mixture of everything. i really enjoyed it . let me just talk about the down sides then. 1. too many heroes with less or no relevant dialogues 2. plot holes, why this and why not that. where did that go. where is this\n\ni guess thats it then.",
        "Everyone thought that the first Avengers movie was something else. People thought that it was the best it was going to get. They were so amazed at the idea of a team up that contained not only one but many of the characters that they know and love. But now, Marvel expanded further. Now not only different characters were brought together, but different universes. This truly was a movie for everyone. I am amazed at how well Marvel brought together these different superheroes to defeat the same enemy.",
        "Just unbelievable. The best of the marvel bunch, everything you could have hoped for.",
        "Absolutelty wondeful. The critic score seems too low, im notmsure as to what they sont like about tje move",
        "Constantly on the edge of your seat. Great action and multiple narrative threads.",
        "Acting was great but overall, a huge disappointment!! This movie might as well been a freaking soap opera. I had high expectations but feel like I wasted time watching this. Usually superhero flicks are action packed, but this....not so much.",
        "I have to admit I wasn't a fan of superhero movies . Besides ''Iron Man 1'', ''Thor 1 '' and ''Guardians of the Galaxy 1 '' I haven't seen any other movie from Marvel . But this movie completely changed my perspective . As soon as I saw it , I had to look for the rest of the movies to understand the plot . And I haven't felt sorry . It's their best movie so far . For two hours and a half you'll see continuous action with breathtaking CGIs . No wonder they gained more than 2 billions worldwide . I have one messages for the morons giving one or two stars : go and see the other movies to understand this one , mthfks !!! Don't write a bad review just because you don't understand it .",
        "What a show! The characters are all amazing...the feeling of enormous impact is totally palpable throughout the movie...the comedy is on point and Thanos is quite possibly the best MCU villain ever!\n\nI cannot wait for the next (and mostly final) part...Bring it on MCU! Totally ready for it!! Amazing spectacle",
        "The movie failed to deliver he excitement and the entertainment that other marvel movies managed to do ,i guess gathering all the characters was a major fallacy within this movie, thanos's performance was a CGI made one didn't feel the malevolence and in his acting at all so much like steppenwolf they should've dwelled in his performance and emerge a new villain that will dominate the scenes, again they should've simultaneously put the superheroes and the villains alike in order to create balance in the plot nevertheless the movie was simply enjoyable but didn't deserve the hype he got.",
        "Best of the 3 Avengers movies. It will be hard to beat and I am eagerly awaiting next years' movie",
        "This is my first time ever writing a comment on IMDB. I haven't much to write about this movie. Just go and watch it. Absolutely mind blowing. Epic is just a word that cannot describe what I witnessed.",
        "If you love marvel and have watched all the other movies you'll love it.",
        "A majestic cinematic experience building on 10 years of MCU storytelling, Infinity War has everything a movie buff could ask for; heartfelt drama, comedy, passion, and startling intensity. This is an absolute must-see film that undoubtedly will influence another generation of filmmakers, and will leave everyone on the edge of their seat after watching it. It's one of the rarified movies one can sit and watch over and over again. 10 stars for 2+ hours of cinematic bliss.",
        "Absolutely an amazing experience! The movie has been filmed awesomely around the presumed storyline. It evokes mixed emotions and is capable of holding you still for the time it runs. This masterpiece is certainly the result of hard work of every single individual named in the cast and credits.",
        "I have been anticipating this movie since the first Avengers and it exceeded my expectations.",
        "It is The first avengers movie I like , and can't wait for the next one. I hope they can make it better then this part.",
        "Just left try midnight showing a few hours ago and had time to sit back and process. I can't believe even after all the hype this movie had i still came out as amazed as I did. This is special. I can't wait to tell my kids I saw it in cinemas. You don't want to miss this",
        "I never saw this before! Strong, rhythm, action, story, numbers of heros, and what the hell, the best vilain I did hope for a movie.",
        "As far as superhero movies go, even if you have never seen the other movies, this is by far the greatest comic book movie ever done! It has everything, from action to drama to comedy to tragedy. If you want to truly be entertained, then GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",
        "I was so super excited to see this and being a lover of marvel movies in general, I feel it held true for most of the marvel characters. Loved the continuation guardians of the galaxy and their own brand of sarcastic humor as my favorite of the marvel series so far. I was completely oh my WTF just happened when the movie ended in a cliffhanger but I feel for this story it's necessary to tell the whole story. The plot comes together with past movies and we begin to see the bigger picture that will follow, and we will be dying in anticipation for! So yes can't wait for more and totally disregard the one-two stars I've been seeing!",
        "It's a Bold and ambitious one. Marvel has taken that leap which it should have taken years before.",
        "I dont have words for describe it, the best super hero movie of the all the times! Just it ^^",
        "This movie has everything what a movie should have. Action/emotional/epic/well connected story from other marvels/ funny/ thriller/ Every sec of this movie is so beautifully craft with every single detail. After watching it, makes you wowwwww and cant wait to watch the finale part..",
        "THE MOVIE IS A SOLID 7.8 OUT OF 10 BUT PEOPLE CLAIMING TO BE A \"FAN OF MARVEL MOVIES\" OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT AND ARE JUST USING THAT TO VALIDATE THERE OPINIONS.THE FILM HAS ACTION,LOSS,COMEDY AND A GOOD STORY.ITS A GOOD FILM ..WATCH IT DO NOT LISTEN TO THE HATERS",
        "This movie kept me on the edge of my chair ... very intense .. made me feel things which I haven't felt before while watching a movie .. Awesome",
        "One of the Best movie I've ever seen , amazing can't wait for the final showdown",
        "The first thing i want to tell marvel finally did it, but the film started action very early. Thats enough to say about this movie, this film unearth our all emotes.",
        "This movie had me speechless, emotional and aching for the next one. In all of my 20 years I have never seen such a great movie. It had EVERYHING (and everyone) you'd want in a movie. I had very very VERY high expectations about Infinity War and I can say that my expectations were blown away. It was so much better than I could've ever even imagined. Recommend.",
        "One of the great movie ever in my opinion. Great plot, great villain, awesome ending. No other comic based movie could come close to this. Definitely waiting for the End Game.",
        "Awesome movie of the year. The opening until the end is FIGHT!!",
        "Don't have the words to describe how amazing this movie is. Great job marvel. It's just what I was waiting for for 10 years.",
        "This is for sure the GREATEST MARVEL FILM EVER ! Infinity War was brilliant on every category: Story, Visual Efffects, Music, Villain, Emotions. You will need to see this in theaters to live every single moment of this movie !",
        "Amazing. An exceptional piece of superhero cinema. Gives me chills every time.",
        "Amazing movie Incretible scenes thanos is amazing but i think winter soldier is still the best marvel movie but still thank you russo brothers for this amazing movie",
        "Let me start off by saying I thought the movie was good over all. The plot was more complex than that of most Marvel films, the intersections of the Avengers storyline with Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and Guardians of the Galaxy being well-done. The movie had the obligatory Marvel comic relief, but also left plenty of room for tragic moments. The ending was not at all what I expected and is a nice departure from everything-is-undone-in-the-last-20-minutes that many superhero movies feature. The dialogue was witty and for the most part well-written, and the special effects were unbelievably good. My only complaint with this movie is with the pacing. I realize it is supposed to be the big battle Thor Ragnarok (as well as Age of Ultron and Blcak Panther had been leading up to) but the back-to-back action sequences sometimes left me thinking the movie had too little plot spread across too great a time span. I nonetheless enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone remotely into Marvel.",
        "As a huge MCU fan I had little expectations for this movie because of all the bad reviews, but the movie blew my mind. Thanos is by far my favorite villain for all movies. I feel like there might be a lot of hate coming from fans of other movies, but everyone needs to see this movie somehow someway. It is incredible. I don't want to ruin anything, but many people are saying there is no plot. These people obviously don't know what a plot is, bc the plot is clear as day, and it is to prevent thanos from getting the infinity stones and ultimately defeating him.",
        "There is a lot of negative reviews here and I don't understand why, the movie is what it is entertainment and a lot of actions and that is exactly what I expected,,when I go see a movie of this type I am not expecting a academy award performance but instead a great action movie and that is exactly what I got !",
        "Amazing.... so many twists and turns and as funny as ever...why isn't it 2019 already!",
        "This is easily and clearly the best MCU movie made to date. The tone and feel of this movie is matchless when comparing to other MCU movies. No other movie in this universe so greatly portrays what you're supposed to feel through this movie. The dark and eerie feel portrayed through the coloration of the movie and the music helps put you in the mood you're supposed to be in. They also throw in great comic relief throughout. Every single detail and aspect of this movie is so well thought. The Russo Brothers succeeded very well with this. Can't wait to see how they conclude the story in Endgame.",
        "After 10 years we finally get the movie we all wanted! The Russo's do not let it fail, it's funny, serious and lovable. No short cuts all the build up was real. I couldnt be happier!",
        "Best movie ever!!!! Easily one of the best movies of all time. If not the best",
        "I expected a lot about Infinity War.But the movie was beyond my imagination. It broke all my expectations.I didn't expect a movie like this.I am damn sure that this movie is one of the best MCU movie ever made.I still wondering how Russo brothers managed to direct this movie with many characters.I was tensed about the movie how would be the scenes with many characters.But Russo brothers managed it well.The movie was super.Entry of each characters made me excited.I was anxious what would happen next n each scenes.The climax of the movie really made me shocked.It was a great surprise for me.And it made llittle tension in me.It made me to wait for the next Avengers movie.I can't wait to watch the next Avengers movie.But unfortunately the next movie will release only next year.I am sad about that.But I will wait for it.Finally the movie was a great experience.",
        "The movie is great, is awesome is stunning,is gloria itself",
        "Okay Disney cats out of the bag that the gifted screenwriters under your thumbs are writing the MCU movies and the thus far way over-hyped flops have screwed up the Star Wars films except Rogue One which wasn't that hard to write being its the crawl to \"A New Hope\". Solos' uninteresting story combined with fact only Harrison Ford is / can be Han Solo, same will show in the recast of Indiana Jones. They would have been better off going way of CGI'd Han Solo voiced by Ford. There was just lame awkwardness from everything out of whatshisnames' mouth, so there was no chance for the lack of weight story within Star Wars Universe. All the would have been interesting backstory was just referred to in conversation like Han's days in Imperial Academy. Could you have imagined the mouths drop if they would have revealed Han's pilot instructor as the Dark Monolith himself, 'Vader'. Any chance for a Vader scene anywhere should be jumped on. It's what puts Rogue One in top three Star Wars films with Empire no.1 and A New Hope and Rogue I consider tied.",
        "Everything Disney did wrong with Star Wars the Last Jedi, they did right with Infinity War. It's the Empire Strikes Back of the MCU. The current situation will be a great start for Avengers 4.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War is a climax of all 18 movies completed over a past decade. People hate this film is probably 1) Do not watch those 18 MARVEL MOVIES or forgotten their story lines (go home and re watch). 2) Too much real expectation (This is a comic book movie so it is not real). 3) Upset about plot holes and big cliffhanger (of course, there will be Avengers 4, so be patient and just accept the movie as it is). 4) They are not superhero stories fan (please find another movie that suits your favorite).\n\nAs a movie fan, I am glad that alive until today to see these years of masterpieces together, well organized and well played, although there are so many characters and plots to put in a 2 and half hours movie. I felt that this movie need more time like three hours, to see more the beauty of its story line. However, to see another Avenger movie on next year for knowing how the story will unfold is the best thing ever in my life.",
        "I don't even like super hero movies, but this rocked. So much depth and emotion, along with amazing action. It's also genuinely hilarious.The whole audience was laughing out loud.\n\nI'm now hooked and rewatching all the marvel movies! It's incredible how they tied every story together. 10 years in the making, and definitely worth the wait.",
        "Pretty depressing that this is so popular. The only thing I'd own out of the entire franchise is the original Captain Marvel comic. & BTW, a pox on Disney & Marvel for making Nick Fury black, thus taking a dump on the best artist in comics history, Jim Steranko.",
        "I am still processing this movie and hour and a half later. Please see it in a full theatre. The reactions from everyone were amazing and what a ride. One reviewer title his review \"I need a Therapist\" and I agree completely. No beginning credits and straight to where Ragnarok left off for the emotional ride of a lifetime. I have been waiting over 40 years for this movie and somehow Kevin and the Russo brothers did it. Thank you Marvel!",
        "Not a big fan of marvel ... but it was their best movie",
        "The haters who gives this movie 1/10 is just doing it to bring the rating down. Which is sad, this movie is amazing. Marvel had overdelivered on a complex villain. Just watch it and enjoy! :)",
        "I am giving five only for the very good effects and the humor inside this movie. It looks like couple of movies inside one with all marvel heroes together. The way how everything is given does not correspond to the possibilities that this kind of movie can give, Very cheap story without any serious or physical reality that any of the heroes can give. Made just for fun without scientific background of how every single heroes can act in it.\n\nFor example Dr. Strange defeated much more powerful enemy in Dr. Strange movie and here he just playing the time shifting crystal as a toy.\n\nVery bad story.",
        "The movie is worth a watch. Thanos is awesome and rest of the character also good",
        "This is the best movie of all time. Best best best",
        "A great movie, people love this. The effects are really amazing",
        "Great movie, nice ending. But tried so much story in very less time.",
        "The movie that has been teased since 2012, and it does not disappoint. Enjoyable, fun, action packed, and tense.",
        "Please watch. At least twice. Everyone get their reason and motivation explained. Every plot is meaningful. Everyone in the theater was shocked and moved. I know it's weird but I kind of respect Thanos after watching for the second time.",
        "How can people give 1 or 2 rate for this wonderful movie?",
        "Great movie by fans of the MCU, for fans of the MCU. It really delivers. Action packed from start to end and lots of fun combination of individuals.",
        "What can i say about infinity wars that hasn't been said before. It's the first part of the epic conclusion to the previous 10 years of story telling. It features attention to detail like no other film, with plot points that have been worked on over the course of those 10 years. The only thing i can say honestly is that it completely changes the face of superhero films, it draws you in, leaves you saddened, excited, scared and on the verge of tears, but yet we still want more, it leaves you hanging on the edge throughout the film, until the stunning and heart wrenching conclusion leaves you hungry for more. bravo Russo brothers, you've created a masterpiece.",
        "Amazing! Shocking! Expect the unexpected! WHY IS GAMORA!",
        "Avengers Infinity War brings you a fantastic mix of all the concepts you'd like to see in a superhero movie: an epic villain, amazingly coreographed fight scenes, death, balanced humor and sadness. I also want to say that VFX in this movie were the best i'd seen in a while. I love seeing the effort the team has put on the movie and with IW i can honestly say that everyone seems to have worked hard in their part. From the actors to the backstage team.I'd expect nothing less from Marvel studios and Russo Brothers. I loved every aspect of this movie. That ending left me as well as the entire theater speechless and wanting more. Perfect movie for a perfect series. Kudos to Russo Brothers for having so many superheroes in one movie and not messing it up.",
        "It's An Unexpected Action Comedy Thriller. Jaw-Dropping Moments, Mind-Blowing Scenes. Ending Will Make you Emotional. This Movie is the Most Bravest Movie to Pull off. You Will Be Like, if u watching for the first time, what is happening. MUST WATCH.",
        "I was absolutely blown away by this movie. It was just as I had hoped it would be! I imagined a much darker feel to it and it definitely delivered!!",
        "This has just become my favourite flim ...watched it at the cinema so glad a went to see it ..this will not disappoint at all ..10/10 must see",
        "The best Marvel film ever? ...I think so, jaw dropping brilliant!!!",
        "Infinity War is a fine summation of the MCU so far. Thanos is the best enemy, he has reason and motivation in his destruction. Josh Brolin was the best choice for his voice. Every hero has his/her part in this movie. The worst thing about it was the end, the movie has a very good cliffhanger, i can't wait for the second part. If you are a superhero or comic fan it is a must see movie, but to understand it, you have to watch every MCU movie from the begining (until Black Panther).",
        "With out a doubt the best film in the Marvel Universe, with jaw dropping visual effects and an incredible casting lineup, I would definitely recommend it!!!",
        "An awesome movie.. Two stories (one in earth and the other one is space) handled very well.. The movie doesn't bored the audience.. It has got Action, Comedy, Emotions all of it.. Desperately waiting for Part 2 specially for Dr. Banner with his issues with Hulk which was interesting, And for Code Red and for Tony Stark as what's gonna be his plans for the other heroes..",
        "My biggest fear was that they would do the movie a bit like they made Thor Ragnar\u00f6k with a funny tone and oneliners (loved Thor btw) but they nailed it.",
        "The most amazing thing about this film isn't the acting or the actors or the story line (even though they were all fantastic) it was the balance. The ability to balance that many main characters, the ability to manage the serious and funny moments and the ability to manage the time. All these factors will make this movie an all time great.\n\nThis movie deserves to be inside the top 50 films ever (although it won't because superhero movies not named \"The Dark Knight\" don't get the same \"street cred\" rating wise)\n\nThis is a beautiful watch, for the best experience see this in iMax 3D.",
        "Infinity war is a great movie experience. The film is written in a way that has 1 huge advantage and 1 huge downside.\n\nThe action packed, character packed movie offers a great experience, especially in a IMAX movie theater, time flies by and lots of awesome moments occur. The scale of the movie also means that some of the favorite characters get undercut heavily tho.\n\n8/10 because they delivered on one of the biggest productions ever",
        "I have to admit, before seeing this movie, I didn't take time to re-watch all of the previous MCU films. I still enjoyed Infinity War very much! The action scenes are breath-taking, the character development is fantastic, and the ending is emotional-it broke my heart. After seeing Infinity War, I re-watched all 20+ MCU movies in the following days, and you know what, I was really amazed by how this story was prepared since day 1, and carried out so well. All movies and post-credit scenes combined made so much sense for the plot of Infinity War. The best character, which I wasn't expecting, was Thanos. He was not some villain who just want to control or destroy the world. Thanos character was built with deep emotion, and a real good reason for his action. I am not good with words, so I cannot express how much I enjoy this film. I really recommend anyone who is going to watch this, re-watch the 20+ MCU movies first. Check on Youtube for how to watch MCU movies in the correct timeline order, don't watch them based on their year of release.",
        "Doesn't get better than this!!! Unbelievable movie, the last years of Marvel movies had a goal... this movie.",
        "Overall, this title earned my review as a critique. Worth my 2hr time.",
        "I'm writing my Review in terms of Graphics and VFX not for Movie story , Overall this movie was great, VFX was great, they put their 100 percent on every seen !! Very good",
        "Since I knew that Infinity War divided into two part, I was thinking this film gonna be boring but I am totally wrong! Best film of this year I think.",
        "This film nailed every aspect, - comedy, action, plot. Everything was perfect. The way they built up the final battle was truly significant and with all marvel films, the CGI and cinematography was truly ahead of its time. A truly magnificent masterpiece of a film",
        "I always loved marvel movies but now iam living it, this was the best movie ever",
        "This movie is just great. It's got thrills and it's got chills and it's got moments that make you want to scream about how freaking awesome the scene is. No spoilers but the ending, though sort of predictable if you listen to what they're saying in the film, is crazy. I really enjoyed it. Would give a 12/10 if I could",
        "With all the hype and speculation making everyone wonder, what is really going to happen? I wasn't sure if the finished product would live up to the hype. I was totally wrong! If you like anything Marvel then this is a must watch. Be prepared to sit on he edge of your seat for 2 1/2 hours non stop.",
        "Thoroughly entertaining and gut wrenching! I loved the juxtaposition of the different character worlds coming together.",
        "Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow",
        "Highly expected.But I think its plot is so simple (And imdbchinese character is illegal?)",
        "Fabulous.Marvel shows its capacity of affection,which builds up a legendary picture.",
        "10 years in making....and a grand finale. A flood of emotions hits u as the characters reveal their distinct persona.....The ego clash between doc and stark.....The newly recruited Spidey who doesn't wanna disappoint..... Hulk with his 'issues'....Star lord's jealousy towards Thor.....The love between Wanda and vision....And most importantly the heart within the Titan.... Everything makes your butt stick to the seat even when the movie gets over.....You might need some tissues for the climax. The grandeur of the fight sequence and the way it is filmed just blows our brains out....A solid villain with a solid intentions who almost convinces us that he is doing the right thing. The visuals are extraordinary and flawless making it a visual treat.... A part of the final portion is a bit 'surreal' but overall a celebration with a mixture of emotions delivered on correct propotions for this summer.",
        "I've never written a review before... But, I felt I should after watching this MASTERPIECE from Marvel!!! Short and Sweet - Movie was a fantastic ride from opening scene to end credits, I kid you not! PACE of this movie was perfect! It does not feel like Marvels longest movie to date.... Go See It In The Theatre While You Still Can!!!",
        "Awesome movie full of action fun no words love you MCU",
        "This movie was an incredible spectacle and was a sight that I have been waiting to see for years! The characters were well balanced and so was the plot. Even though they used thick CGI, I still enjoyed and got used to it. The movie is a intense and thrilling ride all the way through and it definitely gave us all goosebumps to see our characters formed into something new and special. It's just that there is NO CLOSURE! Nothing. It's just not a typical superhero movie. We all knew this movie was going to be different, but we didn't know it was going to be a completely different type of superhero movie. Trust me nothing can prepare you for this.",
        "The best hero movie ever, i never expect the movie be like that exceptional movie ,amazing story,",
        "The movie is really really veey fantastic, I like the concept, many heroes are shown in this movie, and yeah some of the parts are funny here. Must watch in IMAX 3D.",
        "I like it!I like it!I like it!I like it!I like it!I like it!",
        "It can not be a superhero movie !! It is just insane!!",
        "I think everyone had extremely high hopes for this movie, but the realist in me expected it to be a literally impossible feat to coordinate this amount of characters in a cohesive story. I know the result is not perfect and a lot of critics complained about pacing issues, but I genuinely believe that they did the best possible job of juggling all these characters. Even movies like civil war which the Russos pulled off incredibly well pale in comparison to the pure amount of material needed in these 2.5 hours, and it's just an absolute thrill to watch everything together come so well. Of course, everyone's talking about the ending and thanos being great, which I obviously agree with, but I think it's important to remember how impossible of a feat this movie truly was, and I can barely wait for next year's conclusion to this epic story.",
        "Wow what a thrill ride. This sets the new standard on comic book movies",
        "I've been following the Marvel Cinematic Universe from the start and I couldn't have been more impressed and satisfied with Infinity War. Enough has been said.",
        "This film is Avengers at its best! Avengers infinity war is another one of marvals truly amazing films where they are not scared to do things that will shock the viewer. This is the only marval film I have felt that the Avengers and all the of the MCU characters have met their one enemy they can't defeat through just punches and cool abilities. Absolutley amazing and the soundtrack is even better with its more dark tone.\n\nGreat film!",
        "If you've been following the MCU since the beginning then the payoff this movie offers is incredible. An incredible Cast, and an incredible story offer one of the best superhero movies of all time, if not the best.",
        "A roller coaster!!\n\nIf you have been following the universe this is a must watch!",
        "Just watch it there are way to many things in this Movie to explain. It had a some flaws the CGI wasn't the best, it was not bad but it could be better. And Thanos henchman didn't had much impact on the story and were in my eyes killed of way too early. The acting was great from nearly every charakter. In the Comics Thanos story is way better explained, ok this would be to much for a single movie. Without that so some times its a bit hard understand why he is doing what he is doing.",
        "There;s nothing to say about it exept wow. I'm not giving any spoilers, just wow.",
        "Watching this characters together fighting this villain that does fell like a a meneace for our heroes is perfect every character has his/her time to shine!",
        "The movie is amazing. Rotten tomatoes score is ridiculous should be 100%",
        "I went down the list to see who Rated this Move 1 Star. And It's pretty sad. Most people Don't seem to grasp the Emotional Depth present in this film. DO NOT Listen to them! Watch it yourself and decide.\n\nNo Spoilers but this isn't a run of the mill superhero movie - if you're looking for witty one-liners or an \"all's well that ends well\" feeling.... look elsewhere.\n\nThere is a deeper, darker side of the MCU portrayed in great detail. Be prepared to get hurt.\n\nCan't wait for Part 2!!!",
        "This movie makes everyone speechless it is perfect",
        "Love this movie and love how everything seems so real and natural. Producers and actors did an amazing job.",
        "It's the first marvel movie Make me feel Pressure throughout the story.",
        "Do these things -Marvel Entertainment 212-576-4000 (tell them that they killed you) -911 -get a therapist -plan a funeral",
        "Flawless film hands down!!! 10/10 rating doesn't do Avengers Infinity War justice. It is BY FAR the best of the MCU films. Just from an acting perspective alone it's one of the best films ever! I will probably see this at least 2 more times before it leaves the theater ... in IMAX and in 3D.",
        "My title basically sums it up. I loved the movie: funny, witty, and the storyline has plenty of twists and turns with non-stop action that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The only downside is that it's a lot to take in. Watch up on all of the previous movies Marvel has made and be ready to juggle a ton of different connecting scenes.",
        "This movie is just great great acting characters development and the ending oh my god I Recommend this movie to all of you ppl WOOOO000oooo",
        "One of my favourite Marvel films, Thanos is just the best villain, bring on Avengers 4",
        "Its my first review on imdb. I m from India.I had See this movie today...beleive me marvel gave its best movie. I like story telling. Action sequences are outstanding. If you love spiderman 2004, the winter soldier 2014 then this movie is a million time better than those movies. i love winter soldier. I don't love civil war but that is good movie..infinity war is stunning movie. No one can make movie like this other than Russo brothers....I don't know where bad reviews come from what people want. Last thing its not garbage like ultron movie and million times better than first one..Even Josh whedon can't make movie like this ever.",
        "Amazing film that was worth the hype and expectations that people put on it. From the second the movie starts until after the post credits scene, this has you on the edge of your seat! AWESOME MOVIE!!",
        "The movie is well sequenced and the characters looked amazing in the movie, the story line is followed accordingly, however the length of the movie may be a little too Long, but overall the movie is really a must watch for marvel lovers",
        "My friends will like to go watch it again, since they enjoyed it quite a bit.",
        "It is good movie. My friends enjoyed it a lot and they are willing to go and watch it again.",
        "Good work marvel, very interesting movie. There is always action, always somthing happen. Like it",
        "10 years and 18 movies. It has all been leading up to this and itdoes more than live up to the hype! this movie made me feel so many emotions and I have to say that Thanos is one of the best villians of all time.",
        "This is my first review, or you say I've to give my review. This movie makes an impact on you that will last for some time. After a very long time, something extra-ordinary to watch. I really felt the fear of Thanos that means how perfectly this character is developed. Excellent Stuff and a Must Watch!",
        "It was an amazing movie in 2018 till now. All cgaracters did good work. My favorite was Thor, Iron man, Thanos. This characters did a amazing work Thanos was killed it in villain role.",
        "Movie will blow your mind and break your heart it's result of 10 years of movies",
        "An epic space/action spectacle that delivers serious action and emotion.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War was definitely the (2nd) best film I ever seen! Infinity War ha slots of action and is quite emotional in some places because of.... I want people to actually see my review so I'm not gonna say. But I love the idea of every MCU superhero coming together to fight the battles that they never could. Also, I think they did a great job casting Josh Brolin as Thanos as apparently he didn't do as well in Deadpool 2 so at least you can have some fame in a year! (Nah, but seriously he was in too many films this year)",
        "10/10 movie, This movie is filled with action, amazing CGI, plot twist, and amazing acting. The entire time I was watching it I was on the edge of my seat. I recommend seeing this movie to anyone who is ready for a cinematic experience of a lifetime.",
        "I wanted to see the second movie right after when i left the premiere one",
        "This movie was truly amazing, it had me crying,laughing and smiling. The plot was really good and in my opinion I think the best part of this movie is the bad guy thanos. His motives were actually good and he had the longest screen time which made it even better. The acting,writing,directing and action was jaw-dropping. Marvel really have done an amazing job on this one.",
        "It is. The best MCU movie, and my #1 favorite. This is something that I've never seen before in the MCU.\n\nIt's well balanced between the humor and the seriousness. It made me tear up a lot, I'm pretty sure many others cried too. I got surprised so much that I was literally in shock, even after the credits start rolling. It's darker than any other ones.\n\nI am definitely satisfied with Avengers: Infinity War. Though maybe it will be hard to take in, I recommend everyone to watch it. Every Marvel fans shouldn't miss it.",
        "Great concept great timeline. Completely understand the fast pace. But missing the Marvel factor.",
        "TWO AND HALF HOUR OF PURE PLEASURE the end blew my mind",
        "How does't feel when someone said incomplete sentince ?\n\nSuperheros movies is my thing, but the avengers should stop at one point were there is an end ... and you are not giving that end and you will not ( ANYTIME SOON ) ! I loved the blog of the movie, also how it ends. but you should have put an end for avengers serious and start new thing.\n\nThis is last time I watch avengers on Cinema, only free TV ... Till I know for sure it ends there !",
        "There is no single reason why thos movie doesn't deserve 10 stars. It is a perfect balance between the characters. The story, action, fun and drama is all awesome!",
        "Clearly it is the best movie i have ever seen. And please don't wait for the pirated version or see it in a cam version just go into a theater and watch this movie and believe me when i say this you will not be disappointed. Thanos is not like the other 'destroy universe and rule the world' type of a villain we have seen before (excluding Killmonger and Vulture) in the previous marvel movies. We will feel a connection to him and sometimes we may even feel that his motivation to wipe out half the the population of universe to save it not that bad.",
        "Infinity War! The massive outcome of 10 years! Worth it? Absolutely yes. Thanos, the progression of the story, technical details etc. Well done, Russo bros. (and of course our remarkable Avengers<3) The only part I complain about is that Wakanda-Battle. How come the glorious Wakanda Army don't have a cannon or something can be called as 'big gun'? That part was really disappointing. I loved the movie and give 8/10 (but i'm afraid of DC fans so I decided, giving 9 on IMDb is a better idea)",
        "You will save more oxygen upon watching this film. Be sure not to forget breathing!",
        "This movie will keep you at the edge of your seat LITERALLY FROM BEGINNING TO END. It keeps bringing thrill and excitement and the intensity of each scene, but at the same still carrying an amazing plot line. Dude. This movie is INSANE.",
        "Pure impact of action and adrenaline. Special effects are amazing and story line contains dramatic scenes and typical marvel humour at its best!\n\nGuardians harmonize perfectly with the rest of the avengers.",
        "Such an exquisite master piece! Every moment was great and the ending was perfect! It really added a new element of film in which we have yet to see in the MCU. When it comes to villains, Thanos is definitely on the stronger side. He creates a mysteriously convincing character which some how, makes you empathise with him which no villain has ever done before with me!",
        "Marvel took a huge risk in making this movie and fact that it turned out this great is absolutely phenomenon. Hats off to you Marvel. Job well done for all the directors and the crew that worked on this movie.",
        "It was a great film, I watched it in one breathe, the ending was a surprise, but that was the meaning and it told that that's not the end!!!! By the way it was very interesting!!!!",
        "I literally had my mouth wide open when I saw the end credits... I want to know when is the next part coming out and how this is going to end.\n\nBut do keep in mind one thing.... you should be in line with the previous superhero movies to get through Avengers: IW... else your are lost.... Thanos... Thanos... Thanos... the super villain...",
        "The film was a perfect film in every direction this year's movie.",
        "I will not give away the ending but just to say....WHOA....i believe you will get my drift at the end Overall fantastic film---blending in the Guardians of the Galaxy was just amazing and the comedic level at times was superb!!",
        "The film is a mixture between action, comedy and sad drama. What distinguishes the film is the shocking ending. I think that the number of characters that killed an exaggerated number ... I enjoyed the movie and did not feel the time when watching the film and I was convinced that the film was at its beginning and I was surprised that it ended",
        "Everything a great movie should be! Action, humor, epic-ness(?), and leaves you wanting more. Can't wait for part 2!",
        "This is the best Film ever made!\n\ni am a Star Wars Fan but now i am a much bigger Avangers Fan!\n\nso many Special effects and SuperHeroes.... like a Dream!",
        "Awome Movie Its 2018 Top Hit List Confirmed. Its Having Very Marvelous View",
        "Everything I expected, unbelievable, the ending didn't exactly do it for me because all the movies confirmed for the future, but I still loved it and 100% recommended.",
        "I liked every minute of this movie and I'm looking forward to the next one! I did not regret spending money on a movie ticket. A must watch if you enjoyed watching the Avengers movies.",
        "Film is amazing best one they have made yet so looking forward to part 2 this film definitely a 10/10 rating!",
        "An unprecedented cinematic journey ten years in the making and spanning the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, Marvel Studios' \"Avengers: Infinity War\" brings to the screen the ultimate, deadliest showdown of all time. The Avengers and their Super Hero allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.",
        "I enjoyed it every second of it, i didnt feel like it was a 3 hrs movie i feel like whattttttt its already the end i wanted more and more ....",
        "I freaking watched this movie three times now, and it gets better everytime i watch it. It's unbelievably great.",
        "Already seen it twice, will see again in the theater next week Thanos is badass!! this movie is the greatest even exceeding IMO Jurassic Park 1, Star Wars I-VI, The God Father, Batman Nolan absolutely great!!",
        "It was bad so, you know yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah",
        "I love every scene in this movie, they are all perfectly aligned. The movie is beyond expectations and lives up to the hype.",
        "I am a big fan of the MCU and I've watched every single MCU film, and I have never seen such negativity on this one. Avengers Infinity War is a really good movie, no doubt about that. I mean sure that thanos is not the same one from the original comics, but the Russos and the writers wanted to make thanos more like a sympathetic character and I believe that all those haters of this movie are so negative because they're trying to curse Marvel Studios. Don't listen to these haters, idiots and critics who are trolling Infinity War. Just go and watch this movie while you still have the chance, and try to enjoy it like I did. And this movie like all MCU movies has a perfect balance between seriousness and humor but It has a dark tone. (45% serious, 12% funny, 43% dark)",
        "Love it! this is the most incredible movie I have ever seen! not only within the Marvel cinematic universe. It is the best movie ever",
        "After having watched this movie thrice - a rare feat that I've never done in recent years - I felt compelled to add this review, especially after I was equally compelled to review Black Panther for the huge disappointment that it was. To compare both movies would be an atrocity, so I wont even start.\n\nInfinity War just proved how important a Directors role is, in piecing a complex storyline into one coherent masterstroke of movie making - any lesser Director would have failed miserably. The sheer scope of the script, compounded by the greatest ensemble of characters ever assembled made it a herculan task , which was effortlessly handled by the Russo Brothers. The most important thing working for it was the humor, which flows through the storyline effortlessly, and never forced. Reminded me of how hard I was laughing through \"Thor : Ragnarok\" and how much I liked it for it quirky humor. If you happen to be one of those few who havent watched it yet - please do now!",
        "Pure cinematic voyeurism and fun. A ride from start to finish that is mysterious, thrilling, filled with non-stop action (to the point where almost every talking scene is interrupted by action). While the film does tie inholes from previous films, the Russo brothers manage to leave enough to look forward to with Avengers 4 with nothing less than anxious impatience.",
        "The most different film i have ever seen among Marvel movies.",
        "This film was just blockbuster perfection, after age of ultron and civil war i thought... maybe marvel peaked with the first avengers. This betters that by a country mile.\n\nPeople are whinging that the film struggles to balance the cast and that the plot is all over the place. Incorrect, nothing felt forced and all of the little meet ups between characters were so satisfying.\n\nThe action, obviously was brilliant. Love watching all the little bits of teamwork. Also Thanos is genuinely interesting, not just a CGI baddie that punches things (he does throw a moon though!), he has his motivations and shows some emotion at times.\n\nWhere will they go next ??????????",
        "Really enjoyed the film pure escapeism with a few laughs would recomend",
        "The whole point of a film for me is escapism and this is my kind of movie to absorb myself into. Everyone is enjoyable to watch, the guardians of the galaxy are freakishly synchronised as a group as are all of the characters well established and individually fun to watch. Brolin brings it home as thanos probably the best CGI villain ever.",
        "Come on do I have to explain myself? It wasn't what I expected. But it blow my mind",
        "Great film locks of shocks!!! A real epic the back stories come to life and a little spoiler after the credits",
        "I love this movie and you will too. Everything about it is fantastic.",
        "One of the best movie or super heroes movie of the year. It content so much unsatisfied feeling because it have not released many seens.",
        "The film was fantastic,epic ,amazing! I can't describe more.can't wait to avengers infinity war part II!",
        "One of the most intense movies I've ever seen. I was thoroughly engrossed with this movie and for me that is a rare thing.",
        "Amazing movie with constant action! Probably one of the best marvel movies ever and it was good that they had so many different characters in it!",
        "Most films that are hyped are ussually heartbreakingly underwhelming- but for once the MCU didn't disappoint.\n\nFrom the heartbreaking ends -( some unexpected and some foreshadowed ) to the stunning visuals , Infinity War pleases all audiences and genres moving away from the fantasy sci-fi to a drama action that has its emotional highs and lows.",
        "The only problem with this movie is too many Characters. And since these characters are big in other movies and most people love them,they didn't really have time to enjoy their acts. Because literally everyone was fighting for a space. No wonder sometimes they argue who's plan to use.\n\nThanos defeated them because they didn't have a strategy and no leader.",
        "A fantasy movie is maybe the easiest movie to end up OK, but maybe the hardest to make magnificent. And they did exactly that. They deserve the 9/10",
        "I loved the movie and I think it had a good story line but at some points it was hard to follow and it got a bit confusing because there was so much happening. But overall I loved it and would watch it 10000 times.",
        "Pretty much what you'd expect with a Marvel film, but more",
        "Thanos is the best villain in Marvel This movie is fantastic!",
        "Avengers : Infinity war is a movie which not just lived up but surpassed all the expectations. Its an intense movie with many fight sequence but also has its moments of fun. GOG Scenes with Thor add Iron man were the ones which will make anyone smile. even though the los our super heroes has gone through in the entire movie. There is not a single scene in movie which feels extra or unnecessary. All the actors have played their characters perfectly. Even we get to see the different aspects of Thanos personality and its just awesome.",
        "Curious about Avenger 4 untitled movie. Love Iron man and amazing Thenos",
        "Good, not as good as some mcus such as thor ragnorok, avengers1 and doctor strange.",
        "See this movie from the other side, and Thanos is never a normal bad guy, he had his point and his bottom line that he never crossed.",
        "Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is an epic blockbuster.A movie that lived up above the hype. 10 years of building and they made a masterpiece. Thanos..Thanoss.. Thanos.. Thanos brings a whole new definition to fear and destruction. Ultimate villain.\n\nThere is no way you can give so much importance to a villain when you have a movie packed with heroes & there is no better way to end a film when u have a sequel ready.\n\nHope we can fast forward 2018...Can't wait for the next one!!!",
        "Really enjoyed this film thanos was brilliant I actually enjoyed his scenes more then the heros and wasn't expecting that ending.",
        "The movie made the audience feel so many different emotions throughout the film. The film makes you mark the calendar for the next one to see your favorite characters again!",
        "I thought this was a 9/10 but gave it 10 stars to counter the 1/10 from all the moronic DC fanboys. They're not even hiding it well either. Go read all the 1/10 reviews and see how many at some point make a remark about \"how bad it is and it's the sort of thing those marvel fans enjoy\" or similar. They slip up every time.\n\nSo blatantly obvious. Go back to your dire movies and maybe get out of your mother's basements once in a while.",
        "Where do i start , i've watched all superhero movies because i have two boys. Over the years i've learned to love them. But let me just say for this movie i was the one super excited. I was laughing , crying , clapping. This is such a great movie!!! Omg i would watch the movie a million times. My favorite character has got to Iron Man/ Captain America. If you have not watched this movie please go go , run to see it , that's how great this movie is.",
        "A film filled with dull, naive and whiny \"super\" heroes.",
        "Stunning cinematography and effects, some excellent performances, superb story and a light smattering of comedy. A fantastic fantastic movie. Quite possibly my new favourite!",
        "Ticks all the marvel boxes but had a bit of a struggle to remember all of the plot threads from the previous films that led up to this one! Needed help from google to fill in the missing bits I'd lost from my brain.",
        "This was the first time in thirteen years I had been to a theatre to see a movie and what movie it was. This is the greatest superhero movie of all time hands down.",
        "The recast so genius this movie movie genius unpredictable bla bla bla",
        "This is an exited movie! I really like it! It is cool and fun!",
        "Daha iyisi olamaz sanirim Marvel tarihinin kuskusuz en iyi yapimi",
        "WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW AMAZING MOVIE. WHAT I REALLY LOVE ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT, IT TAKES YOU TO ANOTHER DIMENSION. LIKE YOUR ON THE MOVIE. GREAT JOB",
        "Wow. Just wow. The cgi and colours are amazing. The mega arcs by all of the movies are amazing. But captain america could have been in more.",
        "This film is better then I could have ever imagined",
        "Marvel has managed to give a new meaning to superhero genre with a great story and well scripted action. It felt like a dream come true looking at all the characters come together for the epic finale. The movie managed to keep me on the edge of my seat until in the end. Best SUPERHERO movie of all time.",
        "A day after and the movie keeps playing in my mind. Best Marvel movie ever. Thanos was the best villain ever existed on screen. Speechless audience at the end of the movie stack in their seats wondering what just happened..",
        "Cualquier personaje pudo haberle ganado al villano, muy d\u00e9bil,",
        "It's awesome to see all Marvel characters together,that's for the rating. But the plot is so long & simple.",
        "Can't wait for Avengers:End Game \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d This movie was just amazing.\n\nBefore you watch this movie, first go & watch all other Marvel movies to know each Avenger.\n\nExpectations for Avengers:End Game is much high after watching this movie",
        "Having been a avid marvel fan since the age of 5 and watching the first iron man at 9 years old, this film successfuly brings together the past 10 years of the MCU into one epic movie. It's fun and funny but yet dark and ambitious and it works all to well. It's what DC wishes it could be! Such and amazing story witch left me with my jaw on the floor and tears rolling down my face at the end. Genuinely a cinematic masterpiece of the highest order. Your not ready for what happens.",
        "I've spent over half of my life following these movies waiting for this moment, and I'm not the only one. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is probably the most ambitious project in the history of cinema, and Infinity War is part 1 of the 2 part finale (sort of). With that said, it does NOT disappoint. I have never cried so much in a theater. I have never loved an ensemble of characters so much in any art form (except possibly the comics these films are derived from), and nothing has ever inspired me more. These films are why I became a filmmaker, and you're doing yourself a great disservice if you don't see them.",
        "I can definitely say this is the best movie I've ever watched. I strongly recommend it.",
        "Best marvel movie ever, hands down. Incredible combination of the whole marvel universe.",
        "I was erect for at least half the movie. Hulk can smash me anytime he likes.",
        "It balances so many characters very well. Thanos is one of the best villains of all time. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll get frustrated. The characters have their flaws and their own morals. It's a journey coming to a close. It's the movie of an era.",
        "Best Movie in 2018! This movie has made me feel things that I haven't about a movie in a very long time.!",
        "Don't understand why but this is the first movie which gave me goosebumps multiple times",
        "One of the best movies i have ever watched, the ending was unreal",
        "Previous avengers was much better and fun Long No jokes Poor action",
        "Still remains the best Marvel film, in my opinion.",
        "World-shaking events are kid stuff in \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" the first installment of a two-part sequel to \"The Avengers\" and \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\" The whole universe is under attack from Thanos, an infinitely villainous villain sporting a multicleft, prognathous chin. Universe-shaking throwdowns succeed one another with truly stupefying regularity as the Avengers and their Guardians of the Galaxy allies take turns rising to the challenge. But moments that touch the heart are few and far between in this almost-culmination of a decade of Marvel Comics movies. The finale, scheduled for release in May 2019, may well bring the adventure to fittingly grand fruition. What's on screen now, however, is table-setting for events to come, a groaning board of superheroes, a superabundance of undifferentiated superpowers, and an ending that's more exciting than anything that precedes it.",
        "I loved this movie it was amazing. Also it was a little sad but not that bad and you should watch it because it might just be one of my favourite movies now.",
        "Alot of hipsters and too big for their britches type of people giving this 1/10 and all that. This movie was great, the ending was emotional and well these reviews show that some people are hard to please. No one cares about your dislike of it, the movie is well done.",
        "Well!! I loved this movie. Amazing effects! One of the most epic showdown movie!",
        "One of the best movie of all-time. Epic, spectacular, emotional, and well-written.",
        "It was a great movie with non stop action and thrill that u will never have that feeling in any movie",
        "The movie is great l loved I was waiting for a long time ppl will prolly say the ending was bad it wasn't it was just a cliffhanger so that they can make the movie avengers 4 more interesting",
        "Malade .... j'ai ador\u00e9, il y a de l'action d\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res minutes. J'ai ador\u00e9 et j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 h\u00e2te a la suite",
        "This movie is amazing because it always gives you ah, oh moment",
        "I want this film to make a build up to us cause there is some people does not watch all marvel films and they did not understand this film because of that",
        "Yes I prefer this movie and all characters played good",
        "Don't listen to these low raters because they don't know what this movie is",
        "A full review will be added later on. All that I will say is that this film blew me away. A true mastepiece - having 3/4 of 100 charachters and still pulling it off as one of the highest rated films of all time!",
        "It was a great movie not one scene was boring and star to end was a suspense movie",
        "This is my first review at imdb and I have only one thing to say, this film is 'masterpiece'. It is beautifully shot and every moment of the film is worth remembering. It is more than just a superhero movie,it is a celebration of the wonderful ten years of Marvel Cinematic Universe. Each character shines throughout the entire Film. There were moments where I laughed and cheered, there were moments where I was deeply tensed for the characters and most important of all some unexpected moments that made me cry. My mother who is not much of a fan of superhero films enjoyed every moment of every scene. There was one particular scene almost at the end that really broke my heart and quite possibly one of the saddest scene in the entire film. Thanos is by far one of the best villains MCU ever had, he is scary, you cannot help but love and hate him at the same time. Avengers Infinity War is truly a spectacular superhero movie. The cast and crew members should be proud of themselves for the amount of effort they put into making this epic masterpiece. Cannot wait for Avengers 4!!!!!",
        "Absolutely loved it, the movie has so many amazing actors/actresses. Well done Marvel",
        "This movie is boring, without creativity and a stupid final...is just another faileure of dysney....one and another time...",
        "Most movies/tv shows don't really make me feel or relate to the characters. But this definitely did. They did such a great job with Thanos. He feels more like an actual character while also being the big-bad CGI villain. He is easily the best Marvel villain. Can't say the same about the Black Order though. Some scenes are almost guaranteed to leave you at the edge of your seat, especially the fight scenes. Those were incredible! This is by far my favorite Marvel movie!\n\nI give it a 9.5/10!",
        "The movie was great. The CGI was beutiful, and the story was even better. Say what you want about the movie but Thanos was great. The Lavender Low-Life is one of the best, if not the best villian is the entire super hero movie genre to date. The only other one that comes close is Loki. The fight scenes are epic. I especially liked Thor and Dr. Strange in them. I guess it was mostly just the special effects, but they looked awesome fighting Thanos and his minions. There are also some cool non-fighting scenes, like the one from the trailer with Thor and the Guardians. I really like the relationship between Iron Man and Spider-Man. Tom Holland's performance was amazing. Overall, 10/10 would watch again.",
        "Awesome movie and all I can say is that I didn't want the end to actually be the end...I wished there was more...it left me wanting for more...I cannot wait for a sequel!",
        "Avengers IW was an insane movie. It was everything that I hoped for in part one of this installment. Marvel is so great. The ending was different from what I expected, yet also what I expected at the same time. Multiple storylines that are all great, great jokes, and also some very serious moments as well. Best Marvel movie thus far.",
        "A charismatic soldier and a villain that you can't hate.",
        "I'm a huge marvel fan , but in this movie I didn't feel the tension although it's a important war , firstly the acting of some actors wasn't on point , secondly I feel like some important heroes weren't given enough screen time as others, also the script was smart but made the characters more neglecting to the gravity of the threat facing them and just joking around by increasing the humor and decreasing the seriousness, last but not least the movie seemed in a hurry from my personal view . In the end I can't say I didn't enjoy it , it one of the best MCU movies out there , it gave us a great antagonist not like all the others , good in every way not just the CGI that made him look complete and great but also the acting of the actor and the reflections of the character, and it gave us the opportunity to see our heroes united for the same cause .(this was my personal opinion of the movie and I am exited to see what the second part has to show us !)",
        "To sum up, this movie is the superhero movies GOD, I think marvel kicked the hell out of DC's butt with this one",
        "Amazing movie that just celebrates all the movies of Marvel from 2008 Ironman",
        "Every Marvel Movie has lead us to this point, we have seen glimpses of Thanos and now we realize what a Universe at war looks like! Yes that means a really big cast because well the Universe is really BIG! Great Movie and cant wait to see the next one thankfully only a Year away!!!",
        "Heart was in my mouth from the word go and didn't leave there till the after credits scene wrapped up. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and experience most of the emotions in between by the time the 2 hr 29 minutes run time fly's by. By far the best marvel movie to date and will be seeing this movie at least one more time before it leaves the theatres. Ps. I hate you Thanos",
        "Consistence,logical and action .3 words to describe the most successful Marvel Universe movie",
        "What a great movie I ever seen till this time ! Marvel has already create a greate movies with good characteristic from all the heroes.",
        "I have never seen something like this. So, I was really impressed when I was watching it. I love Marvel and his characters. Let's imagine that it happens in our world. I live in this story and impressive play.",
        "The film may inspire people, but I still feel that all those kind of heroes can't exist in real life. So many members of Avengers makes me feel overloaded and that's not neccessary",
        "Superbly written and wonderfully executed. The film delivers from beginning to end. Some CGI is weak but not for the main character Thanos. They accomplish him to the screen in a perfect fashion. The film is 3 movies in one. They squeezed an entire trilogy worth of action, emotion, suspense, and excitement into a single film. The movie is 2hr and 40 minutes in length so plan your bladder accordingly. No handicap patrons had attended the show so after a few minutes into the film, I moved from the very side of the theater to the center of our row where wheelchairs would sit for better seating for my son to see. This led to us being in the walkway for anyone that needed to leave. Every person that had to leave to use the bathroom was literally running to not miss one more second than they needed to of this phenomenal film. I love Marvel (Disney) but have never enjoyed a movie enough to go back, spend money again, and watch it a second time in theater, until now. Consider Infinity War, Maximus Decimus Meridius because you will surely be entertained.",
        "... mixing your food together on the plate. It's okay for the last few bites, but not the best way to enjoy a good meal. ... a big wedding. It's long and loud, and you rarely get quality time with people you haven't seen in awhile and would like to be with ... a musical anthology, but without the best songs from any of the artists.",
        "The best avengers so far and i like what Marvel studio did with thanos a real badass",
        "This is a very disappointing movie and a waste of time. Most MCU movies wrap up their plot in one film. This is just an excuse to make us watch a second movie, it breaks from MCU traditions, and I won't watch anymore of these films.",
        "Mixed feelings about this. You just can't end a movie like this. No hope. That's cruelty.",
        "It was ok, but I was not overly impressed. Glad I didn't waste 20 bucks to see it in a theater.",
        "If you didnt watch this peace of art yet you should run to watch it",
        "Now, I'm usually not one to cry during a movie, but dang, this one hit me in the feels. I won't discuss any specific characters that did, but let's just say you'll need to be emotionally prepared before stepping into the theater.",
        "I am really glad that the quality of comic based movies has finally reached the level it should be. Since DC/Warner is still not understanding how to do it i am looking forward to the next 10 years on how Marvel is developing and interpreting the comics.\n\n@MCU Directors/Producers: I believe I always knew where it should go and there is still more potential for raising the \"level\": What really must/should happen is including the x-men universe especially with LEGION.\n\nI have heared there are plans telling the stories of the celestials, galactus, eternity... and Sony seems to plan something big too (Life, Venom, ?(Mysterio aka Gyllenhaal) etc. which is long overdue, but the most important element that was missing until Avengers (and Batman Dark Knight) was drama. Legion is fortunately taken care of by Hawley (as a series) which is something really special, but the potential movies would have with Legion is indescribable. And one last thing.. the music defines 50% of the movies. Please get inspiration from Tarantino movies, Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy.",
        "Even if you've only seen a few of the other Avengers movies you won't be disappointed.",
        "This made me wet. I'm really wet by the movie because it was quality. Such talent, integrity, determination to appease the audience whether mentally or sexually. Definitely a must see for all ages. Warning: expect abnormal sexual arousements.",
        "A very carefully crafted marvel storyline. Cant just wait for second part of infinity war , let see how thanos continues.",
        "A great foundation movie to an epic conclusion to the avenger series. The 2 hour movie keeps you on the edge throughout with the unexpected, the tragedies and the formidable end. Thanos just grows into you. The movie connects a lot of the past, gives us a taste of the bitter present and keeps us amusing on the inevitable future.. Avengers fans are in for a treat",
        "Best Marvel movie be a long shot !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
        "The film is intense, full of fighting scenes and give audiance no time to relax.",
        "Just my opinion take that as you will, or just tell how wrong i am in the comments.",
        "It perfect the sound ,graphics everything the perfection",
        "Went into the theater with low expectations, and left blown away!",
        "The entire movie causes the adrenaline to flow through your body, making the defining moments even more awe-inspiring. Probably the best movie in the MCU, and the Russo brothers made it as epic, awesome, and defining as every Marvel fan could've hoped for.",
        "They did it! So much characters brought into one very big movie and it is structured and very fun to watch. This is how it should be done. Well done Russo's!",
        "It was just amazing! I have no words. But this says I have to write a longer review. It was just the right amount of action and great story! All the characters are just amazing!",
        "It is really increcible how this movie don't let you blink ever and those 2 hours and 36 minutes you wish them to be more.\n\nThe Russo Brothers made an awsome job giving each character a very important participation in the film and all the story interlace extremelly well between one shot and another.\n\nI was expecting less but this movie really impressed me and I am eager to see it again.\n\nI have never seen and enemy (Thanos) with so logical arguments that sometimes you want to be on his side instead of Avengers. That was impacting.",
        "What do we expect and has always experienced from Superhero movie is one or at max two climax, but this is not some normal superhero movie, this is best SuperHero and Marvel movie. There will be no spoilers in this review so sit back and read it without worrying of spoiling your movie. I believe the way they build up Thanos story and story of stones couldn't be done in better way. The movie is above expectations and worth the hype all around the internet and world. Characters were not just for the sake of being in a movie but the characters actually had a part. Not to mention the way movie started already build up so suspense and intrigue that I didn't even went off for drinks during interval, because I cant miss a single detail. The end of the movie was great its just that I this time I am intrigued for ONE year.",
        "Best Marvel movie by far, I don't know why you have to fill out a certain amount space and this review it's kind of stupid",
        "Marvel Studios reaches ten years, in wich we experience great films and also some not good enough. Despite ten years of Marvel movies, Kevin Feige and all his crew make a terrific job in making us love a film in wich we saw all the well known superheroes working together in order to stop te greatest villain in their hole Cinematic Universe.",
        "From Sci fi action to more natural action sequences, humor at the most intense moments, avengers makes it better than the previous ones in the series. Expectations will be higher in the next sequence.",
        "Throughout the whole movie, you're feeling many emotions and you start to feel everything that the heroes are feeling. Every second of this movie amazed me",
        "The word epic is throw around left and right like a bottom text but this movie truly is epic.",
        "Infinity war has everything to offer. It has best CGI and thanos actually looked real at some points. Thanos hands down is one of the best CGI villain in superhero movie and second best CGI character after gollum from lord of the rings trilogy. Movie ends on a high note which may anticipates us for avengers 4 and post credit scene which teases us for captain marvel. Acting was top notch and thanos made me believe MCU villain doesn't suck ass. 2 films of marvel in 2018 and we have already got 2 best villain killmonger and thanos. I just want to say this movie is spectacular and must be seen on big screen like IMAX. You simply cannot miss this film. Its a visual treat and lots of unexpected things would come so be prepared for it. I am going for 10/10 because this film can be simply enjoyed in theatres not on laptop or tv screens. Thank You!",
        "I decided to watch this film because I saw it had a 9.2 on IMDB. In my head a film with that score must be good. The hype around this film leaves me utterly disappointed. There is little moral behind the story, cheesy lines, a poor script, stupid unrealistic action. I watched it thinking it had a chance to be as good as Batman the Dark Knight because it holds a similar rating. It is crap! It should be rated 6.4 not 9 or 8. There are to many egos following a plot that sends you across galaxies that are hard to follow. The difference to this film and a great film is that it has no purpose behind it. The batman trilogy was amazing because it can show how to beat the struggles of life. But this, I don't even know what this is. But if its the best hollywood have to offer. Then films are on a decline. We need more meaningful, realistic superhero films. Not action packed. The dark knight trilogy got it spot on. Marvel has had it wrong since 2008.",
        "The movie is amazing from start to finish..the only thing I would like to have seen more of is longer fight scene when Thor arrives on the battlefield. Wish it showed a longer amount fight scene and not gone to somewhere else..Was my only complaint but other than that..Best Avengers movie and super hero movie of all time period.",
        "Not getting into the plot but definitely overhyped. The magic of the 1st avengers definitely lost, maybe intentionally done so but some of the acting and script seems forced. I can not think of one wow moment. CGI is great but overall the movie felt empty and without heart, again could be intentional. Let's see what part 2 brings.",
        "Totally dserve watching After 10 years waiting for final chapter.\n\nCant wait for avengers 4.",
        "When I was young, one of the greatest days of the week was new comic book day. I'd be blue in the face to anyone who'd listen about the operatic tales I'd read about or look forward to reading. How does everyone not know about this, I'd ask.\n\nI'm sitting in my house tonight. I'm not an old man but I'm not young either.\n\nIt's like new comic book day. Because what I saw tonight was the best new comic I've read in years. Infinity War begins hard. And it never lets up. I'm amazed. Shocked. Crying. Laughing. And now...? Everybody knows. Or they will.\n\nSee this movie. Excellent.\n\nOr excelsior. Take your pick.",
        "Just WOW! One of the best movies of 2019. The Infinity War is thrilling from start to end. The cast, effects, soundtrack, design, camera just everything is spot on .I expected to be disappointed, but this movie delivers on all fronts. Thanos is the best villain ever introduced and thankfully not only feels completely real in the CGI but also capture every last detail of Brolin's performance. The Russo brothers did great job. And that ending blew my mind straight to the universe, AMAZING Marvel's masterpiece.",
        "Everything about this movie was so perfect and epic, it's what we had been waiting for many years! Just wow...what a ride of feels! I enjoyed every second and can't wait to see how it continues. So much fun humor, action scenes, music, lots of characters etc... The best villain. Also that ending omg.",
        "All I can say is Wow, Wow, WOW!!!! I had to miss something b/c I will be going again on Tuesday!!!! Literally will keep u on the edge of your seat!!! Pure Awesomeness and all unexpected... Please go see what the hype is about..",
        "Maby I like a better end for this film but it's still the best comic I have seen.",
        "Best MCU film yet. Brolin in his role of Thanos was great. Very intense throughtout, the story was brilliant , most MCU fans would be disappointed with the ending but this wasn't a film focusing on the hero's for once.",
        "I've seen a handful of any of the marvel movies at most and can I just say wow!!! The banter between characters was humorous and it was TOTALLY worth the extra money to see in 3D. I'm sure die hard fans/ purists of the marvel world will find fault in it somehow but I truly enjoyed myself.",
        "In my opinion this is an awesome movie, but how would it be if you hade only seen The Iron Man trilogy... My lovely girl has only seen some of the movies but she falls asleep way to fast. But she did absolutely love this movie !",
        "I think its best movie for avengers!\n\nI am very excited for the next part",
        "Cinema completely silent for the last 20 minutes. Amazing.",
        "For the last 10 years Marvel has led up to this. All your favorite characters in one movie for an ultimate showdown. But if you aren't familiar with any MCU film before, you'll be completely lost. This is the cliffhanger-season finale of your favorite show. So brush up on your Marvel knowledge if it's been a while and sit back because this may be the best MCU flick to date.",
        "What can you say? I knew it was going to be huge and it truly is. What Marvel did is marvelous tbh. A definite must watch.",
        "I wish i could give it more than 10/10\n\nEverything in this movie is perfect, i was afraid that too many superheroes in one movie will make so much distraction.. but it was AMAZING",
        "This is the movie we were waiting for 10 years. TEN YEARS CARL! Ten years of work lead to this very moment. Truly historic event. I am very happy to live in this time and see such an amazing things happen on our planet. This is the movie when you come out of the theatre stunned by WOW-effect. I'm sure this movie would hit 2bln. $.",
        "The final outing for a lot of much stars brings together a finish to culmination of 12 mcu movies and what a climax!, sad moments, goosebump moments, fantastic action with an overall amazing storyline, and let's not foget the great movie cast of all time!!!!!",
        "The Marvel Universe had me literally on the edge of my seat till the very end. I walked out literally light headed. Go See This Movie.",
        "This movie has gone down in history as one of the best ever made! Watching all the Marvel movies in chronological order and then this! MIND BLOWN! Can watch it over and over again!",
        "The Hollywood movie you expect!! Loved it from start to the end.",
        "I just found this movie so f good, to be honest i watch Infinity War like 8 times and every time i enjoy this film more and more. I don't know what to say about that masterpiece without spoilers. The plot is simple and good, visual, dialogues, action, acting, everything is at a high level. Ending is unpredictable and shocking. Main villain THANOS is a separate praise for the whole team who create him for this movie, he is terrifying and exciting at the same time, Just brilliant work\n\nI wait for this movie so looong, this is the whole path length of 10 years which i passed, and i'm glad to be here. I'm so exciting for Avengers 4!!!!\n\nJust enjoy it!!!",
        "As a comic book fan, and lover of all superheroes, I had somewhat low expectations for this movie. I assumed it would be just fine. How wrong I was. It was completely unexpected, intense, and a complete emotional roller coaster. Although it had several flaws, they were minor and didn't take away from the story. I believe there's a new generation of filmmaking on the horizon, complete with ultra-realistic, virtual-reality graphics, and this movie packs a punch in that department.",
        "It was Epic no doubt every character was well utilised well introduced thank you Marvel Studios for this Epic Movie",
        "Thanos is so much accomplished as character ....\n\nbest Marvel film ever...\n\nmaybe my new favorite film",
        "Increndible movie. So important for the next history end game.",
        "Most of people were excited for this movie(especially marvel fans),The question here,does It deserve this much hype?.The answer is absolutely yes.The movie have It all,you will be laughing in a moment then after few minutes you will be crying.The action scenes are amazing and epic. Most of all, what makes this movie unique,is the villain thanos. Thanos is by far the best marvel villain or even the best villain of all superheroe movies I have ever seen,powerful and his goals are clear.Overall The movie is the darkest mcu movie untill now and easily one of the top 3 marvel movies",
        "Mad mad this is a good watchvghhjjjlgndxjjxcccbkcckdkxkdjdidusdi",
        "This movie is amazing,All the heroes are here Iron man,spider man,Thor,Captain America Doctor Strange,Hulk...too many\n\nI love this movi,Ican't wait to see Avengers 4",
        "I don't think I can ever recall the last time, if ever, I was anticipating a movie of such magnitude and excitement. After watching this movie I'll keep this review short and sweet as I am indeed at a complete loss of words but all I can say is, I am completely mesmorized, mindblown and somewhat emotional over from start to finish. I wish I had Marty McFly's Deloreon or the timestone to forward to April 2019. A complete masterpiece Marvel. Bring on Avengers 4!!!",
        "Forget Civil War, forget Winter Soldier.... Because this will be the best super heroes of all time !!\n\nToo much epic, too much emotional Great epic scenes make us can not stop claping our hand, so hyped !! And even the after credit make us feel hyped Yes, she will be there, a new future for MCU\n\nCan not wait to watch part 2, and i will watch this again this weekend Thank you Marvel !!",
        "I have NEVER written a review for a film before, but this was by far the most entertaining movie I have seen in a long long time for me to not! Took ten years to get here, and EVERY SINGLE film until now was worth it. Never knew an action film could carry so much substance.\n\nit far from over, and I don't know how I can possibly wait for a year for the next one.",
        "This movie...no words can describe how amazing it is. You will experience every emotions at the same time, that is how powerful this movie is. All of their acting is extraordinary, so you'll understand how their character feels. At the end of the movie you will just sit there thinking: what the hell is happening when can I see Avengers 4. This movie is so hard to describe because that is how amazing it is, and you'll understand what I mean when you watch it...so watch it!!!",
        "Compare to other super hero movies and avengers movies this movie start with lots of confusion. they want to link so many events to build platform to raise new character. they tried to add comedy using hulk and guardian of galaxy. compare to other movies i don't like this much.",
        "I am utterly speechless! This film was just everything!",
        "Hands down the best marvel movie I have ever seen!",
        "Love the action of the movie and the Ending will leave you tearing up.... Can't wait for part 2",
        "This movie is pure perfection , the plot the action the effects the scenery are all amazing ! You cant find a single boring moment in the entire movie , the timing is what impressed me the most , with so many charactees they have managed to give them all enough screen time to satisfy every veiwer also thanos just dominated that villain curse of marvel movies.",
        "Loved it from start to finish. Brutal and dark at times but still with that classic Marvel comedic charm to break it up. Thought the way the characters were written into the story was brilliant and clever, it can't have been easy trying to decide what happens with so many superheroes involved.\n\nAll in all my favourite Marvel film to date. Thanos was exactly what I wanted and his Children were brilliant.\n\nEpic.",
        "Nice!\n\nLoved it. Everything is balanced, humor and drama, visual effects and plot.\n\nYou won't regret watching it for sure.",
        "Thanos is one of the best characters in the mcu and the russo brothers have done a perfect work.",
        "I NEVER LOVED A MARVEL MOVIE LIKE THIS. I was surprised that every character did his role in an amazing way, it's not just storyline now. Hope next part is as good as this, or better :D",
        "What a great movie. 10/10 Perfect ending, funny throughout the entire movie. No boring parts, not one.",
        "Great movie, great ending, and amazing characters!",
        "Seriously?! I waited that long for THIS?! Absolutely the worst avengers movie ever! Marvel just screwed themselves with this one.. there's no coming back from this crap!",
        "I had such high expectations for this film due to all the hype around it but WOW it actually exceeded all of my expectations. I've never written a film review on here before, I just needed to express, and let everyone else know how amazing Infinity War really is. There were so many moments where I laughed, cheered and cried. The best Marvel film ever, the best film of the year. Everyone who had any part in creating this masterpiece needs recognition but the Russo's really did it.",
        "I liked all the marvel movies since my childhood but this movie was really really great.You have to watch it.9.7/10",
        "Gods of Marvel movies. Everything in this movies perfect. This movie will blow your mind.",
        "I rated this a 10 because it delivered in every way possible. It may not be the greatest movie ever, but without giving anything away, it addressed everything that was hyped. We wanted a movie to kick start the Infiity War, and a movie that was great in its own right. I think that's what we got. And it made the original Avengers (an epic movie when it came out) look minuscule in scale. Thanos is not just a mindless killing machine. We could even grow to understand him. The other characters may still be in their own box, but that's they way we love them. Despite that, they've all developed over the last 10 years, been through their troubles and triumphs. Keen as to see the next chapter in the Mavelverse for Earth's Mightiest Heroes.",
        "It's remarkable, fantastic show what is Thanos quest about. Since the start of the very first Iron Man from 2008, all lead to this amazing movie.",
        "After 10 years the still surprise us Good plot amazing actors And of course huge suspense The hype for the next one is real !!!",
        "One of the things I could always count on in a Marvel movie was good would always win in the end. Maybe it's just Hollywood in a dark place but it saddens me when they bring it into a long standing movie line.\n\nI realize they will make another one but if I'd known this one was so dark at the end...sucking hope out of the room... I would have waited to stream it in my own home...prior to the next movie coming out.\n\nIt's sad to me in today's world to not have the uplift one expects from a movie like this.",
        "Amazing film when I first heard there were going to be 60 characters I thought it would be very packed but I was wrong this movie found a way to make all 60 characters have a good part that wasn't to confusing and not hard to follow!",
        "So many characters but so well coordinated!Grt script writing, grt direction, grt performances & grt CG!",
        "Sorry to say, it doesnt worth that much of point.\n\nI just agree that the graphic is nice. I watched it twice because my partner loves it, and she think is a relax movie to watch.\n\nI guess, that's it.",
        "Best one so far! Can't wait for next one. Way too long to have to wait",
        "The first 1.5 hours of the movie is pretty good but the rest of it is a stew of characters and cinematic scenes that go nowhere. Comic book geeks would probably love this movie. D+ Grade",
        "Once again Marvel has made another amazing movie never a boring moment amazing to see all the super heroes come together can't wait for part two",
        "Looking forward for part two We love each part of it and the comic era is and add value we understand the food drama and eliminating half of the galaxy but avebgaers tram works is amazing",
        "As someone whose been watching marvel since the first Iron man, this truly held up to my expectations. I gasped, I laughed, and I cried.",
        "Simply outstanding. Simply outstanding. Simply outstanding. Simply outstanding.",
        "Nothing to say about it................best super hero fim thqt i seen ever..",
        "Must see film bring the tissue this was amazing can't wait till the next",
        "I am still in shock! You have to see it even if you are not a Marvel fan !",
        "If you love the MCU, you will definatly love this film. The Russo brothers really depicted all the characters meetings perfectly, with a decent level of comedy and thrills. At not one point did i look at my phone throughout this entire film amd toilet breaks were a myth, the duration of the film was perfect timing, nothing felt stretched or cut too abrubt. Not only is this a film for you grown geeks but also kids aswell. Something my son will definitly have to endure. LOVE ITT!!",
        "This movie threw out all the flaws people complain about in regards to the MCU: Low stakes Deaths don't matter Doppelg\u00e4nger villains Forgettable villains\n\nThis movie has incredible performances from just about everyone in it, but most notably Josh Brolin, Tom Holland, and Robert Downs Jr. This film isn't just a film, it's an experience. It has so many unforgettable moments that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer. And it's the darkest Marvel film yet. Maybe even the darkest superhero film yet. And it doesn't try too hard to be dark and edgy like the DC films. What makes the Marvel films so great is how relatable and human the superheroes are, and the sacrifices they make to save their fellow people. Yeah, it's a high budget summer blockbuster with a ton of special effects and CGI, but that doesn't not take away the fact that it's a great movie with fantastic writing and A+ Acting.",
        "INEVITABLE\n\n\n\nDread him, run from him... Thanos still arrives.",
        "SPOILER: The action and special effects are terrific, I loved it. But I was waiting so much of this movie... the end of 10 years expectations ! The characters, except Thanos, they are so dull... they don't get the chance to interact as they're use to. There is so many characters that the humour is just about childish jokes, no real talk, not even subtil humour for the end of the univers... after all why don't we laugh when our friend and everybody are diying or going to die",
        "This was an amazing film. So many awesome moments, so many dark moments, and it all tied into a perfect blend. I was literally holding onto the arm rest during the climax of the movie. This movie made me clap and I don't clap.....beat and most emotionally powerful villain since Darth Vader.",
        "Despite the potential for simply a Mr Peanut Butter Crossover Episode, the Russo brothers managed to balance all of the characters. Keeping the focus on a few main threads yet making every appearance matter was no mean feat. Whilst some of the emotional impact relies on your investment in the characters, I'm okay with this. Having spent up to the last 10 years with some of these characters I'm happy enough to walk into the screening with this pre-investment. A fantastically enjoyable experience.",
        "Really liked how they put all characters together. Also liked what they did with Thanos. A great villian where you also see the soft side of.\n\nRIP stan lee! :(",
        "As a huge marvel fun. I have to say infinty war is the best movie of all the marvel universe. Also for me it has to be in the top 5 movie in imdb. Besides the senario. The graphics of movie was insane. Tony's nanotechmology suits were amazing. In the comics by the way, the thing from thanos can be fixeble.",
        "I can't wait for the next one and the future of the MCU.",
        "It sucks... I don't understand the hype. You could foresee half the things that happened in the movie. Sure the special effects were cool, but that's about it. I guess you have to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy it and they must be the only ones seeing and rating this movie since it got so high rate.\n\nSave your time and watch something else!",
        "It is a masterpiece of the superhero movies for me. All the people have been following MCU for 10 years can watch this and feel way different emotions at the same time.",
        "Great story telling amazing visual effects The best comicbook movie ever made Even better than the dark knight",
        "I watched it yesterday in my cinema and it blows my Mind I love this film!",
        "Really a great film to watch. A lot of action and twists in only two and half hour long movie. A new anti-hero, whose character has been crafted for over six years in previous movies and post credit scenes, is at the rise and his powers are becoming unstoppable. The cards between heroes and anti-heroes are dealt very well and a great balance between them are established. You can be excited for a lot of traumatic deaths in this film. But who knows if there be a resurrection. The ending is just hilarious and unpredictable. The DC Universe seams like a rubbish in compare with the Marvel Universe. I hope that the next movie will be at least as good as this one. Though, If you miss some Marvel movies in the past, you may have some problems with the understanding of the plot of this great movie. However as a Marvel fan it is a super movie that honourably ends a third phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I am really excited for the next part.",
        "The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie.",
        "If you are a die hard Marvel fan or have only see a few of the movies you will like this movie. It's so fun and packed of awesome action scenes. There are some problems but what movie doesn't. I have been waiting 10 years for this and I can easily say it was worth the wait, I will be going to see it again",
        "The fact that this movie is getting better reviews than movies like Psycho, The silence of the lambs Star Wars V and City of God astonishes me.... It's an okay superhero movie that had way too much hype.\n\nIt's annoying how people can be blinded from plot holes, cheap character deaths and frankly some cheesy acting for the most part just because of the hype.\n\nI will say this tough, seeing my favorite superheroes unite is super fun, but let's not confuse FUN, with an overall GOOD movie",
        "Probably the most amazing movie I have ever watched in my entire life. WOW",
        "Epic ending, well played! Well animated and there are some good rate of proportions.",
        "Thoroughly enjoyed it and it was made even better by not being too predictable.",
        "Entrances paired with soundtracks paired with visual paired with excellent villain paired with engaging characters in intense fights alongwith an easy to follow plot makes this easily one of my personal all time favourite movies of all time.",
        "Entertaining and well produced but there's so much going on with so many characters that it doesn't connect as much as it possibly could have.....that being said this was great fun. Not a great film but certainly good enough",

        "As close to a perfect movie that I have seen. The stellar mix of comedy and drama helped to pace this movie to where there were no parts that felt as if they dragged on too long. I would have given it a 10, but the special effects lacked in bits. It was expected but still a negative. Go see this. Seriously. The best payoff to a long buildup ever.",
        "Best movie ever and i so exciting for second part .. Best movie ever and i so exciting for second part .. Best movie ever and i so exciting for second part .. Best movie ever and i so exciting for second part .. Best movie ever and i so exciting for second part ..",

        "Made an account JUST so I could give this movie full stars",
        "First time creating an account here specifically for this. Wow this movie is incredible. Very well emotionally balanced from intensity to tugging on the heart strings to laughing your ass off. The black order were incredibly well done as supporting villains. And all our heroes got the screen time and time to shine. The main attraction though is non othe than Thanos. He was done absolutely perfectly. His mo-cap/CGI has to be the best I've ever seen and the character was so fleshed out. All in all go see this movie!!",
        "Wow. Watched it five times so far, absolute spectacle. I've never been more emotionally and mentally beaten after a film - credit to the Russo's. You can read all the 10* reviews on here, so I'll keep it short. Josh Brolins' Thanos is better than Heath Ledgers' Joker. What a performance. That is how you culminate a story - what character development! Also Thor, Drax, Iron Man, Gamora, Doctor Strange and Star Lord shine here. Actually everyone is at their best! Holy sh**",
        "AMAZING! Grear characters with great story! Was never bored when I watched this opening day!",
        "Seriously even though I have never been so hyped about a movie, it still exceeded my expectations by far. Definitely THE must see 2018",
        "Every superhero cameo brilliantly gave u chills. This movie will make u want to see future marvels movie more bc u want to know what happens next",
        "I saw Avengers Infinity War 4 times with my friends I loved it, it is one of my favourite film of this year and it is now one of my favourite films of all time. I kept away from any spoilers before seeing the movie, I also avoided watching adds and trailers. It absolutely surprised me and I'm glad I have seen it.",
        "Its an amazig movie, The plot is just out of the world. The fight scenes make you stay still for all the parts of the movie. You should go to your nearest cinema and buy a ticket, because its the cinematographic event of the year.",
        "All must watch this movie. Contain perfect meeting of power between the best marvel's word heroes",
        "Another great superhero movie of all time. Full of actions from the beginning till the end.",
        "What a great sequel. The script was great, comedy and drama. Bringing together a lot of the characters from the Marvel universe worked amazingly well. Will see it again tomorrow. Bravo",
        "Can't believe that I cried to superheroes movies, one of the greatest movie of all time so farrr",
        "This is one of the best films in the superhero genre. This will blow your mind!",
        "This is a must see for all marvel fans. Forget the haters they don't know what a good film is. Definitely the best avengers film",
        "Excellent way to develop the most epic battle of the Avengers, has many details in its favor and meets many expectations for fans",
        "The best comic book movie. Period. See it if for some reason you haven't already.",
        "I have never seen a movie that has captured my attention from start to finish like this one. I was laughing and absolutely devastated.",
        "I had never seen such a great movie. The way the Russo Brothers connect all different Heroes with different interests together is on another level.",
        "First of all I've never reviewed any movie ever before.this is the first time..i couldn't resist..the movie is that good!!!..it's by far the best superhero movie ever made..i've watched 1000s of movies from different genres..to this day my favorite movie ever was \"The dark Knight(2008)\"..now it's infinity war..hands down best movie ever made..please watch the movie before you see any spoilers..you won't regret it",
        "WOW. Is the one word I can possibly describe such a huge, remarkable movie. This is the beginning of the end of one phase to such an expended universe, and this movie makes it app worth it. If you have not seen this move, HURRY AND GET YOUR TICKETS! IT'S WELL WORTH THE PAY. From beginning to end there is just the right amount of humor mixed with emotions and gut wrenching moments that it was hard for me to sit still in my seats. Dare I say, Josh Brolin plays one hell of a villain (Thanos.) I promise you will feel this characters presence throughout the entire movie. Be glad to know Thanos has earned the spot in the top villains of the MCU which make sense since we've known he existed since 2012's The Avengers. It's all been building up to this moment and I can assure you, this movie is such a thrill that I myself plan to make another viewing soon!",
        "What a great movie. It is one of the best superheroes movies that has ever been made. All of the characters did an awesome job in their role. Definitely going to buy when it comes out in DVD. All I can say is go see it and enjoy! You will not be disappointed!",
        "Action packed movie from first scene to the last scene",
        "Esse \u00e9 um dos melhores filmes de her\u00f3is em minha opini\u00e3o",
        "Best Marvel Movie! Best Marvel Movie! Best Marvel Movie! Best Marvel Movie! Best Marvel Movie! Best Marvel Movie!",
        "This movie takes the past 10 years of MCU history and brings together all of our favourite heroes. During the movie we are put into different situations with our heroes, but this is a thanos movie ( Kevin Feige wasn't kidding). We learn lots about Thanos through the course of this movie and see why he is trying to destroy half the universe. The heroes in the movie were amazing with Spiderman getting his new suit to Drax throwing in punch lines all over the place. Interactions between characters was amazing also seeing all these different personalities interact and how they fight together as a team. This movie is very dark with lots of death, but the heroes still make us laugh throughout the movie Overall, without spoiling the movie we don't stray too far away from the comics and this movie is really a part 1 to next years avengers 4. You will be on the edge of your seat this whole movie to the end of the credits. Mind blowing movie 10/10",
        "I dont think this movie deserves this sorting on imdb vivil war was better",
        "Such a fun movie. Perfect ending. Cool jokes. Many nicely made storylines.",
        "You should just watch the movies. do not watch or read too many spoiler. the best superhero movie ever.",
        "As we all know that this movie is going to be a Huge Surprise for everyone. All the story telling relates and holds our attention till the end and I am very happy to see it on first day first show which is one of the best feeling in the world as you have no idea what is going next and I can not explain how many goosebumps I have in this movie. There some scenes that will blow your mind. This is the only time that I have seen that everyone is yelling at each and every scene in the theater. I have watched this movie in IMAX 3D which is best and I only recommend everyone to see this movie in IMAX because it tells much more. I am a Huge fan of Marvel Movies and I can say that this is the Best Movie till date and I am expecting that they will make upcoming movies more and more entertaining.",
        "It is a good movie to watch however its too long but not the best",
        "Theres a lot of stories happening at the same time so, dont lose any minute of this movie! Its breathtaking!",
        "This movie had high expectations and it delivered. The interactions between various teamups were just awesome. There were a lot of funny and emotional moments in the film.\n\nThanos steals the show with Josh Brolin's amazing performance and the CG was on point. So much so that Thanos looks real. Thor was also a stand out character in the movie. In all, great characters and interactions.\n\nThe last 15 minutes of the movie are basically where everyone in the audience just had there minds blown and hearts broken. It was an emotional ride and a ride I would love to experience multiple times.",
        "Literally perfect, everything we wanted and needed it to be.",
        "Wow it was amazing. Cannot wait for the next movie",
        "Ver good filme. Very fast pace. Great story. Very good vilain.",
        "Gripping and action packed from start to finish whilst still managing to tell a fantastic story.",
        "I was waiting this movie from a long time and enjoyed too but movie ended with suspense and it was quite heart breaking for me.... lol",
        "After a few minutes done, i am freeze a second, likee pfoooooof. whatt thee... is it the ending??!! tbc huh; for iw.",
        "I'm shocked wow, everything has come to probably the one of the best movies in the last decade.",
        "One of the best movies I have ever saw. I want to see it again!",
        "This movie was worth the ten years it was exactly how i wanted it.It was very tearful as well",
        "When you watch the climatic film of a company who's produced superhero films for a decade, you wouldn't expect to see anything you hadn't seen in one shape or form of another. But this film defies all looming expectations and does an impeccable job of pulling you into it's rich overlapping plot and to-die-for characters in a epic part one finale of the first generation of the MCU. It's distinct bold flavor breeds massive success, and the whole world is thirsting for just one more film. And that's what they'll get. And somehow, it will be even more outstanding and extraordinary than the last.",
        "Another great comic book movie from Marvel. I love every bit of it. Can't wait to see what happens next in Marvel Saga.",
        "A true Avengers sequel and a must watch for Avengers fans or infact, a fan of any of the other superheroes - Thor / Captain America / Panther / Guardians / Hulk / Iron Man ..\n\nI hope they never stop making these movies !!\n\nGOOD TIMES",
        "Whether you are a fan of marvel films or not, Infinity War is a tremendous masterpiece that conveys the struggles of the Avengers in a way that we as an audience can actually feel their pain and anxiety oozing off the screen. This film is based on a universe that doesn't exist, and yet it feels so real when the intense moments come. Infinity War is funny, entertaining, thought-provoking, and brilliant. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.",
        "Best movie from MCU, so far !! One of the most hearttouching movies of superheros you must see, and let you see an unexpecting ending of this movie.",
        "This universe that Marvel created is so good, it is amazing what they can do with the time line to make everything work, it is my favourite movie from all time without a doubt...\n\nNow I just have to wait until 3rd of May of 2019 to see the conclusion of this amazing world :D",
        "This is one of the best live action movie ever...Robert D Jr was best among all the heros.",
        "Wow! If you already enjoy this genre of movie and have invested the time to watch most of the previous Marvel movies leading up to this and you can handle hard endings - then maybe, like me, this will become one of the best movies you've ever seen. Fantastic.",
        "Best Marvel cinematic universe movie ever !! With such a big cast .. and so much build up ... hype .. everyone expected the movie to disappoint . For me it didnt . It succeeded in all aspects . The action and cgi was better than in any other marvel movie before. the best villian in a marvel movie . the movie itself was emotional , let room to grow for some characters ..even tho i mean thanos especially cuz it was kind his movie ... but also gamora .. thor ... ironman .. had character moments. Black Panther was a good movie for the first 30-60 mins but became shallow really quick.. it was more of a bad written and bad directed James Bond Marvel version to me, even tho the acting was pretty good.. but Infinity War felt like a true Marvel movie..",
        "Has none stop action start to finish, brilliant story, brilliant CGI, everything",
        "This is everything I hoped for. I have waited for infinity war for so long and I didn't try for once to lower my expectations because I simply couldn't, i went to the movie with high expectations and boy it DELIVERED. I cried three separate times in those two and a half hour period. The movie was intense, the crowd was intense and everything was intense. Most people were setting on edge and are so locked with the story and the characters. You don't feel overwhelmed by the huge amount of characters and storylines and i think the editing -which was so so so beautiful done- had a huge impact on that Now I'm not going to spoil anything but i have to say Tom holland's performance in one particular scene was so beautiful and heartbreaking and the acting was overwhelmingly good. He never fails to amaze me. Going to this film I heard people say how heartbreaking , sad and dark it is and I thought i was ready for it but I wasn't and I don't think you will. I hate this film in the most loving way possible.",
        "Marvel sure know what they are doing. The storyline is well-designed. VFX scenes are super satisfying. Lovable heroes. Intimidating villain. Very creative in every way. So many characters yet handled so well. It was a visual feast to the eyes. I saw it in IMAX3D and it was just perfect. There might be a few goofs during the movie but hey, all movies have some. It is such a pleasure to see the development of Marvel's universe and heroes. They evolve through out the films in a best way possible. Totally recommend the movie.",
        "This movie simply exceeded my expectations greatly and that was not an easy task to do. Although this movie is rated about an 8.7 on IMDB, many user reviews claim that it is overhyped and confusing and they are simply wrong. This movie is everything it promises and much more. It has great emotions, plot, and above all a great villan. This is the best avengers to date and in simple terms, a must see film.",
        "Very very spectacular film. It's one of the best films that I have seen",
        "Haters keep hates,you can low rate this movie,if you want,but that doesn't make this movie bad.Infinity war is the one of the best superhero movie ever made..the movie is more than everyone expected..or haters please show us,best superhero movie of all time.",
        "AVENGERS #infinitywar felt like Marvel just dunking all over DC: Genuinely funny jokes that felt effortless, real emotional stakes & payoffs from a decade of world building and character development, crisp, inventive action sequences and an ending that left my jaw on the floor.",
        "I don't usually write reviews but this movie was amazingly awesome!!! I couldn't believe what I was seeing on the screen. It has so many twists and turns that you will be like \"WHAT!!\"\n\nThe movie had a really somber and dark feel to it and there were some intense scenes (I won't spoil it). This is a must see!!!",
        "For all the people who rated this movie badly, SHAME ON YOU not Marvel. Every movie doesn't have to be a happy ending with shining rainbows all day round. Infinity War has broken the traditions of having good endings. Thanos is the biggest bad-ass in the universe and YOU SHOULD ACCEPT that fact. Infinity War is basically a Star Wars-esque movie and Marvel did it brilliantly. It is called INFINITY WAR, yes WAR for a reason so the pacing is a little bit faster than usual yet cost us more than 2 hours. If you are a true deep-thinking Marvel fan, Infinity War is basically a new beginning of something bigger than itself. Kudos Marvel.",
        "THIS WAS THE BEST ONE OF ALL . DONT WASTE TIME GO AND SEE IT NOWW",
        "The movie was good by itself but the ending had pissed me off and I didn't even know about the post credit scene until three days later and I feel like the post credit scene was the thing that calmed me down",
        "Yes this is a POPCORN EPIC ACTION COMIC FLICK! But the Stakes are Real, We can feel the Pain of Loss and Wow!!! The Villian is Far more Complex than Anything I had Expected! This is a Must Watch for Marvel MCU Fans! Loads of Winks, Nods, Payoffs, Laughs, and WTFS!!!",
        "The actors are Amazing and the memes are beatiful. I love Thor to mutch to hate This film he just have everything he is funny and Badass.\n\nThe humor in the film is just so good i love et",
        "Me and my 5 yrs old daughter enjoyed every bit of this film. How new teams form up was exciting. Team work was entertaining. I wished more from Banner... Hulk did almost no thing, so did Natasha.. But eagerly waiting for Thanos to be back. Thanos was nice!",
        "I've seen a lot of great movies, some even recently, but Avengers: Infinity War gave me this feeling that no movie has been able to accomplish. I was constantly thrilled by the action and on the edge of my seat through every exciting outcome. When I had left the theatre, my friend had said that I had cried like I had lost a family member. The characters I grew up with, the character who I've seen develop through the years and to see their emotions and their reactions. It's fascinating and heartbreaking. This movie grabbed my attention the moment it started and didn't lose any focus. I'd recommend the MCU to anyone just to have them watch this movie. Congrats to the Russo brothers for making such a breath-taking experience! I can't wait for Captain Marvel and Avengers 4!",
        "It's great movie Anderby the, the only thing that I have a good idea, I have a",
        "This movie is incredibly entertaining. The comedy, the costumes, the CGI, the music... all of it is extremely well done.The acting is incredible, and it's great to see the characters we've loved for a decade all come together in an epic war for the future of the universe. That being said, this is a bad script disguised by great production. There are plot holes everywhere, the ending is unsatisfying, and there is no character development. Thanos is incredibly well done and the backstory is compelling; in contrast, the heroes Marvel has spent so many movies developing and making real and complete fall flat because they have no real development. There is no theme. It is true that the people who are saying there is no plot are wrong- there is a plot, there just isn't any emotional substance behind it. It is action without a compelling story for our heroes. Hopefully, all of this will be fixed and explained in the next installment, but for now, this movie is entertaining without anything more to it.",
        "I just saw the movie two days ago. First I thought how could possible that Russo brothers could merged this number of heroes in one movie. The story and script is incredibly amazing. The rnd scene was quite impressive same as all Marvel Movies. I can't wait until i see the next part of this adventure next year. I thanx the director, producers and all cast who participate in this movie. One more thing. I don't think so the story of the avengers will end with part 2 of infinity war. There more to come. This thought stick to my mind few months ago.",
        "This thing is incredible I loved every thing about the movie And,spoiler alert,the ending is nice and \"different\"",
        "Don't Listen To These liars! This is movie of the year contender!",
        "Berry good berry noicee love it berry good scarlet so hotjakd",
        "Fun isn't something one considers when reviwing movies. But this(Avengers infinity war)... does put a smile on my face.",
        "Don't understand the negative comments. The film was solid. Lived up to the hype.",
        "Never thought I would see this in the big screen. Well done, Marvel/Disney!",
        "This is the best Marvel movie so far! It's like going to the theater and see the best episode of your favorite tv series, because you know.. it's all been leading to this! The directors were able to fit every character's story in without making it seem forced. Humor is on point and CGI is absolutely amazing! I saw it in IMAX 3D and it was absolutely worth it, I can tell it was one of the best 3D movies since Avatar and I felt like I was completely immersed in the story, both mentally and physically. It has everything you need to see but nothing you would expect, it's a pure experience that will certainly blow your mind, from the beginning to the very end. The countdown for Avengers 4 has begun..",
        "Feels satisfied of this movie. This one of the greateat superhero movie ever",
        "I really love the movie, the gathering was not as complete as I expected, but the action sequences were great. Some characters missings, but at the end a great movie. I hope that Marvel doesn't wait ti much fir the secind part, 'cuz many fans will waiting for a retribution after this end.",
        "I am just speechless. I thought it would be great movie but I can not expect that much. This movie have made with lots of super hero. In the previous Marvel movies we saw different movie have different category, like funny, action, brave, talent or sad ending movies. In this movie we found every thing. And this movie's script is out of this world. It is really good. And also there are many mysterious things, for that we need to wait for the next Infinite War movie.",
        "An amazing movie ,stunning .i felt that i watched 4 superhero high class movies at once... I'd rate it 9.5 only for 2 scenes...the scene thor activating the star was boring and unjustified... And the last seen of cap mourning vision had a very bad cgi specially with hulkbuster",
        "I've seen this film probably half a dozen times at this point 3 of those while it was in the cinema. The film has such a great pacing that I never get bored. Are there thing's missing yeahh I was kinda dissapointed that a few battles are missing, but I can't dismiss what we did get for what we didn't get it as the action is still astonishing. We finally get to see the MCU come together with characters meeting and using their powers together against a familiar foe. It has an amazing soundtrack and visuals and is not afraid to keep the focus where it belongs instead of trying to give everybody equal screen time and the ending is incredible. Totally ready for End Game. I felt the need to write this review as there as so many negative reviews on here its crazy do these people have no sense of wonder or are they just bashing Marvel cause they can't stand there success? The best film in the MCU and promises more greatness in the future. Screw the haters.",
        "Infinity war is the superhero finale we've all been waiting for. it's action-packed, funny and it truly shows the best sides of all our favourite heroes. the 10 year build up to infinity war is surely worth the wait and is truly one of marvel's best films to date. the wait for part 2 is definitely going to be a long one!",
        "Bold to its core , such an appalling conclusion and greatest villain yet",
        "I've always been saying that this generation, whilest the Star Wars franchise is still going strong, the Marvel Cinematic is this generation's Star Wars. And Infinity Wars is one of it's finest work. Everything from the beginning all the way to the end, just resonates with action and drama throughout. I have watched this twice and I barely even noticed the two hours pass by up to the final scene. Marvel have truly made you invest in the characters to the point where you are happy or sad for what happens to each of them. And much like the Empire Strikes Back, it makes you want to see it again and come back for more when all is said and done.",
        "All super heroes in one screen! Lucky us. \ud83d\udc9b Story is poetic.",
        "The best MCU movie to date, not afraid to make bold decisions, wonderfully written story, fantastic action, all round spectacular!",
        "Third Marvel movie I enjoyed after Iron Man 1 and Thor 1.",
        "Was an awesome movie and would not change a thing about it",
        "-_- THIS MOVIE PUT ME THROUGH SO MUCH I REFUSE TO SEE IT AGAIN UNTIL A4 IS OUT.",
        "This was beyond the movie I expected. The Russo brothers did a unbelievable job with the cast and story line. The best villain next to Vader was created because you felt for him. The most emotional ending for a marvel movie ever. Beyond excited for the next movie a year from now. Please keep all of us in suspense and questions Thanks for making comic books come alive that have been in my closet for 30yrs.",
        "World-shaking events are kid stuff in \"Avengers: Infinity War,\" the first installment of a two-part sequel to \"The Avengers\" and \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\" The whole universe is under attack from Thanos, an infinitely villainous villain sporting a multicleft, prognathous chin. Universe-shaking throwdowns succeed one another with truly stupefying regularity as the Avengers and their Guardians of the Galaxy allies take turns rising to the challenge. But moments that touch the heart are few and far between in this almost-culmination of a decade of Marvel Comics movies. The finale, scheduled for release in May 2019, may well bring the adventure to fittingly grand fruition. What's on screen now, however, is table-setting for events to come, a groaning board of superheroes, a superabundance of undifferentiated superpowers, and an ending that's more exciting than anything that precedes it.",
        "This movie is perfectly balanced, as all things should be.\n\nThis movie is way above my expectations, it is awesome from start to finish. You can feel its weight and it just makes me more and more excited for the future of Marvel Studios.",
        "I enjoyed every bit of this film. The directors and producers did the best they could with this massive cast load and it was really fun to watch. But that being said, there are a lot of characters in this movie. With many characters that demand much screen time it was definitely a challenge to make sure that happens. I'm guessing that's why the movie was so long. I have nothing but good things to say about this movie. GO WATCH IT. The only negative is that I left the theater feeling that the movie was very crowded...because it was. The movie went all over the place and at some points you could really feel how crowded it was and it distracted you from the film. Other than that it was really well done. Thanos is definitely the best Marvel villain we've seen and it'll take a lot to top him.",
        "Best avengers movie so far!!! The plot was very well put together.",
        "Amzing movie best of marvel Over the past decade marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic book origins. The 18 blocbusters movies produce since iron man first blasted of into the atmosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre.",
        "The Avengers Infinity War is kind of like the Iron Giant meets Lord of the Rings, Tony Stark meeting Doctor Strange. The plot is about as linear as the VR world of Real Player One. Only Real Player One was a video game.",
        "Infinity War will be one of the best films of the year, with film directors making a great film not only as a super hero, but as a Hollywood movie that deserves to be seen more than once.",
        "This is for me the best film from far away from Marvel Studios, it is everyone who has the best villain, although I really liked erick killmonger, Thanos is undoubtedly the best. The action scenes of this film are very good, but this is something that Marvel has already shown us, but something that makes this film so special is its courage in relation to other films from the same studio, the interaction of characters is also anything and more I do not say I only have to say that who has not seen the film should go see as soon as possible.",
        "In the middle of the movie I was already thinking \"This is goooood\"",
        "Not what I expected. So many errors film wise and just not a good piece of the MCU.",
        "Culmination of a decade.You will be in a state of shock when the credits roll.Marvel gave fans what they promised earlier.If you didn't run to the cinema for some reason you should run now.",
        "As the title says, the best movie ever made until avengers 4.",
        "Avengers Infinity War is the best movie this year so far it has action jokes and the best of all a good story",
        "So I refuse to give any spoilers because I'm not that type of person, but all I can say about this movie is just, wow. It had such a twisting, turning, roller coaster of a plot. This movie is very worth the hype let me tell you right now. Although this will be a VERY long year until Avengers 4.",
        "This movie is not only the culmination of the MCU but answers our deepest questions. This movie is NOT an Avengers movie, but think of it more of a Thanos. Josh Brolin's portrayal of Thanos is truly amazing, in my opinion the best villian the MCU has ever scene. You will see layers of Thanos unfold throughout this movie, even the villain has much character development. This movie has so much to it. It is hilarious, epic, heartbreaking, you will cry out laughing, screaming, cheering, and crying. The ending to this movie is amazing and unpredictable, it will leave you shaken in seat and longing for the next one. I advise everyone to go and watch this masterpiece, because you will not be disappointed. (and remember to stay for the end credit scene)",
        "I was blown away with the cast and how they seem to connect really good, i loved every moment leading up to the end. I can't wait to see the next one WOOO! this right here",
        "Thes Movie ever. Totally amazing movie. I can't wait for the next movie",
        "While this is a great film...I feel the unnecessary deaths to some popular characters are too predictable for the next part of the movie. Especially when some lackluster heroes are still alive...I love the way the directors are giving the audience how strong Thor really is and the number of things his powers can do. I love how Tony's tech evolves in every new movie...but the movie could have used some shared screen time with all of the original avengers together and since heimdall died, where was Valkyrie and Skurge? They were on the spaceship with Thor at the end of Ragnarok also.",
        "Whether you like Super Hero movies or not, this is a classic. Can't wait for the next one.",
        "\"Avengers: Infinity War\" is the second-most-expensive film ever made. 96% google users liked this film. You must watch it!",
        "This is definitely one of the most shocking, action-packed Marvel movies todate! It is devastating, but it doesn't disappoint! I can't wait to see how they follow up this story line!",
        "This movie enforce me to watch again at least 8 marvels movies to understand thi one..... I just cant wait to see the final in 2019",
        "Out of this world...Can't complain its a must see.",
        "I was worried before watching it because I thought I had expected too much but it absolutely didn't let me down.",
        "That was hell of a movie, they did a very good job",
        "It is just amazing great story line straight in to the action. All the marvel movies lead to one big one. Just can not wait for part 2",
        "Jokes 10/10, Action 10/10, CGI 9.8/10, Story 10/10, Marvel 10 Anniversary",
        "This was worth the wait! Amazing! What else is there to say?!",
        "An unbelievable management of more than 20 casts with epic journey of 10 year of mcu with best cgi and casts. With mad titan thanos and the avengers",
        "Me and my fiance enjoyed every bit of the movie from start that is until the Finish. I guess maybe it would help if I would watch the ending credits as well as I have learned that Marvel has two significant points leading to the next movie. It left me Clueless and wondering but the effects were great jaw dropping impactful and yet job well done. As I tried to be a part of the cast I guess I was just part of the crowd watching as everyone else was left in suspense of what yet is to come I will recommend this movie Down the Line to others who haven't seen anything connected to or related to The Avengers.",
        "Not many movies has lived up to my expectations, but this one even surpassed. Go and see the movie. NOW",
        "Haven't watched a movie to this great for a long time. Being there with my daughter plays an crucial important part as it is great to know that she shared the excitement and non stop thrilling of powerful actions.\n\nAbove and beyond all the superheroes movies or perhaps any actions movies before with emotional, spirits, cosmic scale of suspense and wonderfully combined with humours, love and team work.\n\nAlmost 3 hours but does not feel the time at all as this movie stole it. Perfect! Everybody stays until the very end to watch which I never seen before. I am very happy that my 8 years old daughter enjoyed from beginning to end.",
        "Russo brother have developed master piece with well developed characters. Movie is going really fast with parallel stories. I am not going to actually talk about specific story and scene but i would say that each scene and moment is perfectly portrayed by each of our favorite actors.\n\nI am really overwhelmed after watching the movie. I am also going to watch again in theaters.\n\nThanks Marvel for providing the best movie ever. MUST WATCH...",
        "Great popcorn movie! Action, humor, picture, everything on its right place. Of course it's not the one I'm going to see again and again, but very good choice for weekend evening",
        "I feel iw was way too predictable, I kinda feel like I knew what was going to happen straight away. There were no real defining moments for me where I was on the edge of my seat or where I was shocked.",
        "This is the best marvel film yet. It's sad to see that many people who didn't understand the movie or even didn't watch the movie are saying negative things about it.",
        "Wow.. amazing and brilliant. Nothing ia too much. Funny , emotional, spectacular. I really feel that everything I'll write will hurt or offend this perfect movie. Words will fail to describe. Thank you for this work of art.",
        "One of the best superhero movies after dark knight",
        "Brief parts were interesting and exciting but frankly most of it was predictable and cringe-worthy. It was better then Infinity War but that was terrible so nothing to be proud of. Only one real good part and that was about 10 seconds long in a 3 hour movie, goes on for too long at the end with nothing happening",
        "Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. This movie keeps what the mcu have been promising for years.",
        "The best Avengers movie to date. And one of the greatest super hero movies of all time. Also one of the biggest cliffhangers in movie history which leaves you wishing that you could see the next one right after you see this one.\n\nOverall a great movie. Wish they could've expanded on some things but they did a great job. And they throw a lot of people off on what they think will happen vs what actually happens.",
        "Has a great plot, and was very emotionally involved. If you've like the past Marvel movies, you'll love this one.",
        "I've been following the MCU since it began. Seen every movie many times and trust me when I say this is the best of them. I might be biased because of this but it lived up to the hype.",
        "This is not only a film this is a story which everybody need to know... marvel had arrange the story very well... all the expectation were fulfilled.. nice thrill and action.... waiting for the avengers 4",
        "The most well deserved movie I have ever seen. Every character in this movie did awesome... Story line is out-standing. I can't describe it's awesomeness in words. just watch it guys...",
        "This film depicts many stories that come as one for a final battle against an unstoppable tyrant. The stories are all 3 dimensional. The movie moves at a consistent pace where we do not feel too rushed or too slow. There are no parts whatsoever which lack in character. Throughout the film you've got a raging stiffy. This is created through every amount of screen time which shows Captain America. This is not a film that non marvel fans will hate. This is one they shall love. This movie caters to their fans, dropping in Easter eggs here and there. The film will put you in a mental coma. Please watch at your own risk. Batteries not included.\n\nThis was written by the residents of the pentagon. Each sold separately. Hot wheels beat that",
        "Absolutely loved everything about this movie. I've been huge fan of the MCU since the very beginning so I was so hyped and had high expectations. It definitely exceeded them and I couldn't be happier. It was amazing.",
        "The best Avenger movie ever, i'm very enjoyed the movie.",
        "Loved it but so many open possibilities for that dang ending",
        "It's ro dark with a perfect cast it's to amazing \ud83d\ude0d",
        "Only registered to point this out because it's got beyond a joke. The reviews can't be trusted.. Before \"Black Panther\" hit theaters, alt-right Facebook group \"Down With Disney's Treatment of Franchises and its Fanboys\" announced plans to sabotage the \"Black Panther\" audience score (the same group previously took responsibility for targeting \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" with negative scores). The group reportedly created a Facebook event called \"Give Black Panther a Rotten Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes\".\n\nSeriously. What a joke the reviews have become and a waste of anyone's time to read. I think IMDb has a problem with its own \"User Score,\" which allows registered users to rate a film on its scale of 1 to 10 stars only after the film has been released or screened at least once. However, most users don't write a review; they tick off a star rating and move on which i believe the most accurate reviews.. avoid the comments at all cost!",
        "To say I was excited about this film was an understatment, and I was not left underwhelmed. This film gave me everything from hysterical laughter to tears of sadness. I worried with so many characters that it would be lost, but every character was given the best scene for them to shine. Action, action, action followed by the biggest emotional punch to the gut ever! I've never loved a film and hated it so much in my life! Love this film!!!",
        "I watch this movies since i was a child.I love Marvel and I was waiting 10 years to this moment and it doesn't disappoint. The movie is awesome!!! Thanos is the best villain that i have ever seen. And see Avengers with Guardians is epic!! My favourite film.I am waiting very excited for Avengers 4!!",
        "Like this movie will surprise you it will make you sad it will make you excited every thing was just so balanced in this movie it was perfect",
        "This is the ultimate movie. WOW !!! Absolutely phenomenal",
        "If you love Iron Man, Thor and Strange then you should watch this movie. The movie has some pretty good fight scenes with Thanos. Thanos lived up to the expectation of being top villain in the MCU. I really enjoyed this movie.",
        "When you watching the movie, time past very fast but there are a lot of script errors.",
        "This is honestly the best film to be ever released. So much action, drama and just have no words for this remarkable piece of art!!",
        "There is nothing bad in this movie. This movie is spectacular. Enough said.",
        "The action and the effects were all first class. The story line was filled with holes and questions. For an action packed movie it was awesome but it didn't offer very many intelligent twist. Thanos wasn't the cool hearted killer I was led to believe from the other movies, he was calm and focused. Most of the aggression can from the Avengers. Even Dr Strange tossed out civility and went straight to violence. At the end of the movie I found myself asking the question, \"Who were the real villains here?\" I enjoy fantasy movies and this one is good enough to watch again but only for the action and effects, the writers left out a lot of info that would justify the violence of the Avengers but hey, that's Hollywood.",
        "There's nothing to add. You just can't take your eyes off the screen.",
        "I just saw the new Avengers Infinity War movie in theatre and I have to say it's just amazing. I love how Marvel managed to fit all these characters in the movie. Also I wanted to mention that there were a bunch of surprises about the soul stone and what happens at the end of the movie. It's quite worth waiting for the after-credit scene to see what the story of the Avengers 4 movie might become. The film is totally worth a look!",
        "What's the main idea?Who cares about it! I saw Thanos's heart deeply through the movie. It is so strong but weak! The character moved me ! And I also think Thor evolved by taking those troubles. Look forward to the ending!",
        "I cant say anything about this film.. after watch this... i cant wait for next avengers trilogy.\n\nPERFECT!",
        "The Story telling, effects, action, way of thinking the decisions...they were all amazing.",
        "I never seen such powerful thor before...amazing entrance of thor makes thid movie to the height of mount Everest...love u thor keep this power and axe till my least breath",
        "If A$AP Mob and Pro Era joined together and became a new Wu-Tang Clan, that would be like this movie. The best thing about this movie is the sheer amount of superheroes that there are, and somehow it all works, and you get a good amount of screen time for (almost) everyone. The action is amazing, and the whole thing is great for comic book fans.",
        "Wow just shocking and blow my mind its amazing movie",
        "Worth it! 10 years of MCU! Makes your feelings and mind blow.",
        "This Is The One Of The Best Marvel Movies I Have Ever Seen In My Life, The Cast, Script and Their Performance; It's Just Too Perfect To Be...",
        "The movie gives you an amazing experience of superheroes and how some got together to stop thanos. The CGI was AMAZING!!!!! It took the 10 years to creat this amazing movie and it's worth it. The actors were awesome. It was worth every second of my life. I saw it 3 times and was not tired of it. It is the best movie of 2018 till now.",
        "Simply an amazing movie. Devastating, but amazing. It was exciting all the way through with new things happening. Wasn't hard to keep up and the plot was great. The entire movie had a theme of awesomeness.",
        "Avengers infinity war is the culmination of all what has been built in the past 10 years. Directors had come and told their stories but now it was up to the Russo brothers to put everything together and make all these characters with individual story lines work in a single setting, though that had been done in the previous movies but this film took it to a whole new level. The movie in spite of so many people didn't feel over crowded and everyone got their time in the sun shine. Thanos was an exceptional villain with motivations and goals that made sense. He was powerful, wicked yet had weight in his actions, so great in fact that you think \"Hmm this guy has a point\". Despite Marvel taking a dark route this time they don't shy away from making jokes time to time heck I would say this is the funniest Marvel film yet. I tip my hat to Marvel for making the most funniest and saddest film yet. My gripe about it would be that the Dark order was boring,bland and cliche. Can't wait for what's next!",
        "Simply Amazing. was absolutely blown away by this movie.i think im still in shock.",
        "Only Avengers 4 can beat it. Period. The movie has it all. Connected timelines, story, emotions, consequences of every action and not to forget that villain toys with everyone. It's just not a happy ending movie which I might think will piss many kids off. The movie is just mind blowing.",
        "Avengers Infinity War is a blast from the start especially if you're a comic fan this is a blessing given to us by the Russo Brothers. This movie is darker than the rest of the MCU movies with great visuals and amazing story that will set up for the upcoming Avengers 4",
        "When the trailer is out.. i'm very exciting! And then, when i wathced the film.. i just wannna say WOW!!! this amaze!! I hope marvel can make film like this again",
        "Best marvel film made to date, my favourite comic film bar the dark knight. This film has everything! I was blown away.",
        "KACHOW!!!\n\nEvery Cars movie was way better than this piece of crap film!",
        "I watch 4 days ago this movie on web-dl format and I was amazed beacause of the quality of this movie! I want Marvel to do Infinity War 2",
        "It surprised me, very good job. whatever it takes, watch this god damn movie",
        "The thrilling saga of a purple space man who acts as an analogy for american occupation of the middle east. lots of video game inspired action that is sure to keep the children of the audience entertained while adults lust over the visions perfectly sculpted abs. overall a fun time, especially the ending.",
        "Thor is incredible, everyone was incorporated well. Title says it all, go see it.",
        "This was the ultimate best film this Summer2018! Can't wait to buy this movie and watch it again.",
        "For a \"Marvel movies\" fan I think this is thrill and agony from the beginning to the end. Be prepared to feel confusing emotions and rage that are hardly experienced from a normal Marvel superhero movie. I give it a 10/10 for the unexpected, for for the feels and for the empty spot left in my heart. I guarantee that whoever sees this movie once will for certain go the second time soon after. Consider this review form a Thanos fan.",
        "No movie can be perfect. No movie can be 10/10 but Infinity War comes close. All the surprises and action kept me on the edge of my seat (cliche but what else could I say to describe it). All I want now is to know what Stan Lee's cameo will be for Avengers 4. 'Nuff Said",
        "This is my all time marvels fav movie ever.were all characters were shown perfectly,the graphics was awesome and the thanos performance where very very very good.",

        "I wait for this from 27 Jan,2017 Since the shoot was stared.i see it today i can't explain how really it great but climax makes me wait for 1 year.Thanos was very crusial with emotional villain and did wonderful job by josh brollin.Wanda Ane Specially Thor Have amazing power inside movie.You will be shocked after you watch this if you are die hard fan of Marvel just like me.",

        "The movie is very good,sheathed the screenplay ,the effects or the battles ,but the movie concentrates more in talking Than actual movie,& also make the villain much vulnerable than we think ,the sound effects could have been used as it was like some Star Wars theme ,other wise the movie was great & also tempt us to think what will happen next,,,",

        "On a purely subjective level, I loved this movie. Ever fiber in my nerdy body fell in love with this movie. I wont get into much more but I had a blast watching this unfold. As I said however, this is not a movie, this is an event. Do not walk into this movie expecting rich character moments or complex themes. You really have to have seen the prior films to understand who everyone is and what they're all about. It's 3 hours of people punching things. I have a few other complaints but then I'd be getting into spoiler territory.",
        "Wow this movie was insain!! The caracter has so evolve!",
        "Best movie ever! Completely went against all predictions!",
        "This movie is out of the world what a awesome movie and story i don't have words for this movies plz go and watch the movie in 3D and heads off and thanks to Marvel and all actors and specially director Russo brothers to do that magic...... thanks",

        "Watching this movie is very enjoyable. Collecting actors and very popular characters are the reasons for the success of \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"",
        "I couldn't find any bad thing about the movie, it was epic!",
        "Avengers Infinity War is ther third instalment of the Avengers films and all I got to say about this is that this film is HUGE and the stakes is larger than life itself. What can I say about this film?This film has a great pace despite being longer than 150 minutes and also being the longest film in the MCU. This film overall is GREAT,the pacing,most of the comedy,the action,the drama,the tension and the romance was suprisingly handled well. Okay so Thanos might be the most intimidating comic book film villain of all time and he in my opinion is the best MCU villain. But,there is a number of flaws which are some of the comedy does not land,some of the subplots felt rushed and the other flaws I will not get into because I would be spoiling the movie already. Also,I could see this movie being a very divsive film. Just go watch it is what I'll say and I will understand if you disliked the film or liked the film. (9/10/A)",
        "Every scene in this movie was worthy digesting and trust me you wont need someone who will disturb you when you go watch this movie.... and of course its a MUST SEE movie, best superhero movie I have ever seen. The villain Thanos, is great, fierce and is deservedly to be named the bets villain Marvel has offered. The accumulation of so many characters was magnificently executed and the plots and story line move in a way that even non-super fans of Marvel can understand. The heroes and heroins were given their best performances and the action sequences will surely makes you jump out of your seat with excitement and goose-bombs too. The jokes are on point however the movie was so emotionally invested and there are some sad moments that surely makes you drop tears like a baby and a lot of surprises to unpack. All a can say is Marvel Studios delivered what it promised and fans will be left with so many questions after watching the movie and hope the untitled Avengers 4 comes sooner than later. Good job Marvel Studios",
        "I went in to go see this movie with butterflies in my stomach... And I gotta say it did not disappoint. The plot was on point. The characters amazing as always. And oh the big bad Titan Thanos, Lord know I wouldn't wanna mess with him Jeez. It was awesome seeing him and his goons in action on the big screen. This has gotta be by far the best movie in the MCU. Of course it's 10years leading to this why wouldn't it be!!",
        "I really enjoyed watching it. The movies is really recommended for everyone!",
        "I honestly expected a lot, but assumed I was going to be disappointed. Somehow, they managed to do the impossible. Take ten years worth of characters and story and turn it into an epic movie. The best movie I have seen in theaters in years, and possibly the best PG-13 movie I have ever seen. Underrated by critics, easily a 10/10 and worth multiple viewings.",
        "Some of scene make me shock some scene make me imotional too. Thanos is the best villain I've ever seen. He not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones.\n\nOne of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together.\n\nIf You are a MARVEL fan Or If You Are a Superhero Fan Definetely Yo Will Like It.But You Need to Watch Previous Marvel Movies.",
        "A remarkable movie for ending first 10 years of MCU. Things i love the most about this movie are the villain and the ending. Thanos is truly the best villain in MCU. His emotions, his ideal, everything about him had shown in this movie made me and so many fans love him, even thought he was right. And the ending, it make me speechless for 2 days to think about it. It actually is the ending that most of the fans has wished for. The ending makes me on the emotionals roller coaster. Infinity war is absolutely awsome. Note: To enjoy this movie, you should watch some MCU's movies first to know some characters and to understand them",
        "I was on movie theatre to see my favorite heroes (infinity war) , I realised that they are not only my heroes but they are heroes of world .",
        "Keeping it very short! this movie was a way to introduce Thanos, as what a way to do it! Incredible cinematic piece. And to implement all those characters and with all the stories behind them, genius.",
        "This is one of the most entertaining super hero movie i have ever seen for a long time. Mavel exceeded my expectation. At the same time I am feeling very disappointed of DC, because they are not able to provide this kind of movies.",
        "It wull blow your mind and break your heart. Not the usual superhero movie and cant wait for the second. Definitely recommend!",
        "It's the best movie I've ever seen. It's a masterpiece from the point of view of Sam. The role of all the characters is perfect in itself. I hope Thanos is doing this and I am trying to convince myself that the universe is the owner. Can you be happy after you have done these for the death? Let's see what I will live in Part 2. It is a long time to wait for another year.",
        "How can people voting 1/10 be taken serious?? Even if you really hatted the movie, i don't see how can it be less than a 6/10.\n\nFor me, this film is better than all 18 MCU films that came before, and if you watched all of them (at least the avengers and one thor, captain america, iron man, guardians of the galaxy) you'll understand everything (plot, jokes, drama etc..). 9/10 (I put 10/10 to contrast with all the 1/10)",
        "Best marvel movie yet recommend this for any marvel fan!",
        "Greatest Marvel movie EVER. Thanos is a compelling villain and Josh Brolin delivers an outstanding performance. An easy 10/10",
        "Can you f$@ing mention a movie with 40+ characters yet still managing to succeed? Its infinity war. To the stupid haters out there. Why don't you direct a movie with 40+ characters in it? Let's see if you can do it. This is what makes you think that this movie is a complete masterpiece. A unique villain is a villain who thinks what they're doing I'm their perspective is the right thing just like what vulture and warmonger are.",
        "Good movie with all around story. People in cinema who did not know this is part 1 got sad. If you are fan of genre do not miss just naje sure to use restriom first since this is almost 3 hours of sitting",
        "I hate superhero movie because it all have a happy ending but this movie , OMG i was hocked pple were like r u kidding me Thanos won and we lost multiple superhero.",

        "The greatest movie of all the sequel, can't wait to part two.",
        "This film exceeded expectations it was incredible.",
        "Astonishing movie.You will be amazed!All heroes are here to make this summer unforgettable.This is the rare summer film that exceeds ilofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Universe.The Mad Titan (Thanos)is going to face some resistenc from our heroes.But who knows whats going to happen.Maybe our heroes will fail or they may win.But its Marvel and anything can happen.Enjoy!",
        "I don't review much but after watching Avengers : Infinity War thought to write something. So many avengers i feel could not justify every one of them. Movie is decent but they have done cheap trick and incomplete ending. Not impressed.",
        "Start to finish just excellent. One of the best movies ever made!!",
        "It was a very emotional action packed movie that had all your favorite characters in one big amazing movie.\n\nRECOMMEND",
        "One of the best movies of my life. I'm still with my pants wet after seeing a couple of days ago. Marvel, thank you very much.",
        "This ilm was just...... Simply put its amazing clearly a must watch !",
        "Normally when I get excited for a movie, I expect too much and am not satisfied with the movie. This movie excelled my expectations and I couldn't have been more happy.

        "Epic in every sense of the world a gigantic achievement in history of cinema !!",
        "This is the pay off of the entire MCU and it lives up to the hype. Don't want to write any spoilers so I'll keep it short, but anyone who dislikes this movies doesn't get the point of the ending or they didn't like it before they ever saw it.",
        "I've been waiting for watching this movie over 10th years. and this movie very very AMAZING FUNNY, SAD, All In One Place in this movie. Good Job MCU. can't wait for next movie after THANOS SNAP his Finger.",

        "Perfect balance between the characters. Excellent CGI. Wonderful Soundtrack. Great Villain. Surprises. Consequences, Humor, Tremendous Action. Awesome Final, ah! I forgot, Thor is the MVP!.\n\nRip DCU.",
        "After 10 years of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, it's great to see that Disney and Marvel have still yet to give a truly terrible addition to the universe - with a huge ensemble cast which is balanced beautifully - you will laugh, cry and remain on the edge of your seats from the Marvel Studios logo to end-credit scene, which I seriously suggest waiting for!\n\nIf you like the 'superhero' genre, you will love the 19th entry into the MCU.",
        "JdjfjjsjskfjfjgnngejsndjfkgkjsjdbfgNjsjdjsjsjsjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjdjddjjddjjdjddjdjjddjdjdjdjjd",
        "Just amazing.The movie was definitely worth the wait and I'm already excited for the sequel.",
        "Great film best marvel movie to date. Thanos is the perfect villain to unite all of the heroes.",
        "Just great enjoyed it. Do definitely recommend watching it once at least",
        "Marvel movies are not really my style. I have not seen the first Avengers or most of the previous Marvel Movies but I still thought it was really good. I liked the cast, I was entertained, My kids loved it. I think a wide range of people will like this. It is definitely worth seeing. We probably wouldn't have gone to see this in theaters If we didn't Have MoviePass. We love it. Looking forward to seeing the new Jurassic Park.",
        "The Marvel Cinematic Universe started out with the first installment, Iron Man in 2008. It's been 10 years since then with 19 installments a TV show and spin-offs, now ending with, Avengers: Infinity War. The Avengers have fought villains of great magnitudes, such as Loki in Marvel's The Avengers, and the psychopathic robot, Ultron from Age of Ultron. But, nothing compares to the Mad Titan, Thanos. In Infinity War, Thanos (Josh Brolin) is a powerhouse. His motives are simple and nothing stands in his way. The way that directors, Anthony and Joe Russo portray him as the main character is a polite surprise. Instead of the Avengers being the main protagonists like the usual, Thanos is portrayed as that role, and the Avengers are the antagonists are keeping the Titan from his goals. You feel bad for Thanos and eventually, understand why he is doing what he is doing. I am definitely giving this a 10/10.",
        "The movie was hyped up like crazy. And I'm amazed by the fact that it did better than the hype.",
        "IT WAS A FANTASTIC MOVIE FILLED WITH ACTION AND PEW PEW AND LIKE ALOT OF DEATHS BUT DONT WORRY DEATHS ARE DEATH AND IT IS INEVITABLE TO AVOID IT",
        "Saharusnya film\" final chapter seperti ini durasinya harus lama, 3 bahkan 4 jam no problem, jgn di gantung part 2",
        "Amazing how they balance all the characters and still manage to make an action packed understandable and comprehensive story. Thanos is the best villain in the MCU.",
        "Whats up with some of the negative reviews here ..i dont get it ..this movie was awesome ...if your looking for a movie with lots of talking then go watch something else .if your looking for loud explosions , awesome fight scenes and some emotional death scenes then this movie is for you ..9 out of ten",
        "Infinity War is the best superhero movie I've ever seen.",
        "All round it was an excellent watch with plot twists that blow the audience away, this movie was a fun adventure with all of our favourite characters",
        "This movie is a work of art, compilation of imaginations & most probably a beautiful presentation of values & emotions..",
        "After 10 years of buildup Infinity War lived up to the hype and then some. Not a single character is wasted and Josh Brolin gives a memorable performance as Thanos.",
        "This is probably the most heaviest movie of all time. In terms of scale, emotions and the rest. They just changed the stereotype with this one film and redefined marvel Cinematic universe. Hats off Russo brothers.",
        "It's fast paced, exciting, and fresh. But, it falls back onto some Marvel movie cliches. Is it the best Marvel movie? I don't know, sometimes big franchises can resort to one aspect of their movies to always fall back on and in Avengers: Infinity War it became very clear. The constant one line witty remarks can drag it down and sometimes have no place. On the other hand, this movie gave three dimensions to a lot of characters. It added more to Tom Holland's Spider-Man and developed Thanos masterfully. Some people may complain that some characters did not receive enough screen time and that's true, but this is the comic book mashup movie the fans have been waiting for. I will add that some characters were poorly developed like Star Lord and Banner, but I really can't fully give my honest opinion until Avengers 4 is released. This movie was a giant cliffhanger which will either seem epic and dull by Avengers 4's answer.",
        "Infinity war is the last movie of the MCU so far, Russo brothers do not waste any time introducing new characters, from the begining to the end it is full of action. Its based on the comic \"Infinity Gauntlet\" but have too many diferences to be consider as a copy. A movie that you cant see only once if you are a comic fan.",
        "Even arter watching all of the other movies, this is All that you can expect and much more! Not going to Spoil it. I am just going to say great script, great acting, great cgi. An emotional rollercoaster: Impecable!!! I am sure I will Watch it a couple of Times more right after watching it five times more! All to be greatly enjoyed! Nothing could prepare you for this!!! Greetings from sda!",
        "I really loved this film and all the technical and cinematic elements, and it ripped my feelings into shreds too.",
        "Too a long time fan of the Marvel cinematic Universe this movie has the charm of the marvel movies while still pulling your heart strings",
        "The movie is Awesome. Worth of 3 Hours of footage. Soundtrack is Awesome Along with Visual Effects. The Cast Nailed it Absolutely.",
        "Just.... wow. A perfect wrap up of 10 years of Marvel and at the same time successfully opened up so many new stories and possibilities for the next 10 years.",
        "This movie is fantastic. Got me gasping and laughing constantly. Loved every single second of it. Cannot wait to see where this goes onto Avengers 4 and beyond. Absolutely recommend watching this! 5/5!",
        "Awesome, because it was released on my birthday! it was nice as usual marvel movies and the shooting techniques were also nice.I pay attention to them because I'm the director :)",

        "In one word to describe Infinity war is just fabulous fantastic superb awesome mind blowing etc etc",
        "As a big marvel fan, i can say that this is the best marvel movie so far in the MCU!\n\nNow there will be those that disagree but we all know MCU has been building up to this for some time now, and it did not disappoint, with the witty comedy and typical superhero moments...\n\nI would heavily recommend this movie and franchise to anyone wanting to start a new mcu journey, or for those to rewatch as I can guarnatee you missed something!",
        "The lives upto the exception, superb direction, eagerly waiting for the second part",
        "Best Movie Ever I'm Waiting For The Next Film And I'm Certain That It Will Better Than This Film Although This Film Is Excellent",
        "I really enjoyed the movie with all its great twist and turns of all the different teams of other movies coming together and really showing the excellent writers did to make it entertaining. I can't wait to see what they come up with next.",
        "The movie is a must watch. The graphics and CGI are all good. Cannot wait for the second part. The movie left me speechless. I would recommend for anyone who like action movies and if they liked any superhero movie.",
        "Best superhero movie of the decade, 10 years were worth the wait, avengers infinity war is the greatest action movie of the decade, hands up for our heroes, long live Iron Man and Captain America.",
        "First of all, those having difficulty in understanding the movie have not watched all the 18 movies prior to IW. Everything in this movie is outstanding, and what most people ignore while rating is the fact that the story is yet to be completed. The movie, as a whole, is written very nicely. Some details have been purposely kept out as they will be highlighted in the next Avengers movie, due to arrive on 2019. The character development is fine, as the makers have not shied about revealing the humane side of the superheroes. Thanos is the big baddy, and he dhows the megalomania we all love in a classic villain. Once again, watch the movie and judge yourself regarding the hard work of the whole cast and crew.",
        "The only comic book movie that can rival The Dark Knight",
        "It's a little bit boring from the first time movie start. But after that, the war really begin! Nice movie!!",

        "I was left speechless, shocked, surprised and i was really looking forward to the next part. It's a complete movie as well as a part of a whole at the same time. Must watch, but make sure you've watch previous movies to fully enjoy it.",
        "Big hip for this movie I'm going to enjoy this movie",
        "The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",
        "It's a action movie of lot of heros: iron man,spiderman,thor etc.It's the story of Thanos against the hero.Thanos to look for the stones of intinity to have the power of the univers and to destroy the earth,it's the war.The famous heros fighting to save the humans. Thanos is fighting in the galaxy to search the object that gives the power to destroy the humans. in this film there are specials effects well made the hero haves the new costume,the new armor.My favorit scene it's at the end when thanos snaps his fingers and the half of the hero turn to powder and we see thanos alone arounds with white.I loved this movie because theis lot of action lots of fights and the story of this movie is captivation and in this movie is the hero that i like him.It's a very good movie this movie there is to main caractere.The caracter of the movie are Robert downey junior,Chris pratt;is producted by stan lee;Anthony russo and james gun.ANd this movie was released on cinema in 23 april 2018",

        "The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie.",

        "I'm still very curious about this film, because it's so full of a mystery and doesn't know what it will be like in the end",
        "This film is super great. Before you watch it you have to watch Thor: Ragnarok But once you've seen that you're good to know. Hope to watch how everything turns out in Endgame after this roller coaster of a blockbuster",
        "Big fan of the Avengers but got a bit behind and only saw Infinity War today. I wanted to watch all the spin offs like Doctor Strange and Black Panther to get an idea of the characters. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to see Endgame!! One thing that annoyed me is that my favourite Avenger Captain America doesn't have his classic shield!!"
